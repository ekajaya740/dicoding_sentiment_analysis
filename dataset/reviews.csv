10,"An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
10,"For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

10,One of the best of all time.,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10."
10,Amazing movie,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
10,The greatest movie of all time!,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema."
10,Everything you've ever heard is true...,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."
10,I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"
10,"#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
7,Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've,"I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film."
10,This Movie Has Haunted My Life...,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
10,A Masterpiece,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Do not miss this film!"
10,perfect,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
7,Not sure,"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.

The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.

But i never get into it.

The plot is ok but i wanted more.

I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.

They just ""looked"" and there was silence.

I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".

I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.

The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.

Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.

For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.

I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself."
10,The film of films,A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
10,How things were done back then!,"The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
10,The world inside the underworld!,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
10,Perfection,"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest."
6,Count Me In The Minority,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.

I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.

The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""

It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

6/10"
5,This is the #1 Movie?,"I was finally forced to watch this 'masterpiece'. What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film 'elites' love so much.

It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story? Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.

This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system."
10,The Don And His Sons,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.

All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.

Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.

The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.

Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.

In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.

Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.

The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.

The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.

In fact it's all beautifully played."
10,The Godfather,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
10,The GODFATHER what else can i say ?,"The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family)."
10,Simply the best,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.
10,A genre-defining masterpiece,"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.

Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.

Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.

Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.

So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.

An all-time classic."
7,Good but overhyped,"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.

For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering."
10,Classic,"One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.

The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.

The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.

The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.

A powerful and unforgettable film achievement."
10,"For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.

The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.

Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.

But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.

To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.

But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.

Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).

Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.

If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
10,"One of the best of all timeA masterclass in filmmaking,","The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I'd argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.

Don't worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won't even notice the time passing, it flies by.

The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.

With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.

If you're considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it's sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.

This film has had a significant influence over the years and will always be one of the greatest. 10/10."
10,The greatest film of all time.,"The power of cinema at its purest and most vivid expression. Screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, editing, it all comes in the most elevated form. Francis Ford Coppola is a craftsman, as every director and artist should be, that draws inspiration from the power of the words and of the actions of characters and provides the standard upon which all the following history of cinema relies. It's an historic work of art."
10,Best Movie Of All Time,"This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on. It's a must see for everyone."
5,"Has its moments, but not the best film","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film."
10,Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice,"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!

The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.

Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.

Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!

10,"The Greatest, no questions asked","Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.

Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.

The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.

Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.

I highly recommend this movie."
10,Truly the Godfather of movies,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.

There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.

I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
10,The godfather,"The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it"
10,"Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again, ever.","The Corleone family face a threat to their lives and business.

This is one of the greatest movies of all time.

I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.

There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.

Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.

It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.

Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.

The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced."
10,The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."
10,It is good,"This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic."
10,How To Make A Film 101,"I truly wish all those who believe this film is boring and overrated can understand it one day.

Everything in The Godfather is executed to the utmost degree.

Characters- Each member of the family is very distinct. From the very serious Tom to wacky Clemenza to fiery Sonny to wise and calculated Vito to cold Michael, The Godfather has very colorful characters.

Cinematography- Gordon Willis, the main cinematographer of The Godfather does an excellent job portraying a gritty city, riddled with crime. There are beautiful shots of the urban landscape. My favorite in particular is the one with the Statue of Liberty, the black car and the grainy field.

Setting- The Godfather taking place over 10 years is perfect. Starting with the end of WW2, with Michael being a veteran and all and ending 10 years later, no longer being loyal to his country but to the family.

Writing- There's a reason it's up there with Chinatown and Casablanca as a film among the top three greatest American screenplays. The slow descent of madness is perfectly executed.

10/10. Only seen it once but everything has been ingrained into my memory."
9,Great,Superb movie i remember i watched when i was in college.
9,It is good,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 49 years old and has aged well. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic."
7,Very Average Film. Very Overrated,"Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.

However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.

Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.

7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it."
10,*A Masterclass in Storytelling and Performances*,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the landscape of cinema since its release in 1972. At its core, the film tells the gripping tale of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan navigating loyalty, power, and the complexities of family ties.

One of the most striking aspects of ""The Godfather"" is its meticulous storytelling. The screenplay, based on Mario Puzo's novel, expertly balances the personal and the political, allowing viewers to engage deeply with the characters' motivations and struggles. The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, giving weight to each decision made by its characters, immersing the audience in the intricate dynamics of the mafia underworld.

The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone becoming iconic. Brando brings a blend of gravitas and vulnerability to the role, making the patriarch a figure of both fear and respect. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, transitioning from the reluctant outsider to a central figure in the family's operations, showcasing a powerful character arc that captivates throughout the film.

Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. Cinematographer Gordon Willis uses shadow and light to enhance the film's mood, creating a dark, atmospheric aesthetic that reinforces the themes of secrecy and corruption. The iconic score by Nino Rota complements the film beautifully, adding emotional depth to its memorable scenes.

When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This movie is an epic, in every sense of the word.

Ultimately, ""The Godfather"" is a profound exploration of power, morality, and family. Its intricate plot, compelling characters, and artistic craftsmanship make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're a first-time viewer or revisiting the film, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-see cinematic experience that reaffirms its status as the greatest films ever made.

#masterpiece= 10/10🔥"
10,Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.,"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).

In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way

The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.

Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.

Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.

Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).

In short, The Godfather is the don in every department."
8,Slightly overrated,"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.

For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.

What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.

What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.

And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).

So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.

8/10"
10,The Pioneer of All Filmmaking,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing.

The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.

The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!

The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.

The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome."
10,"""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die."
10,The best movie by far.,"So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...

The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.

What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies."
10,No Movie is the Best Movie Ever,"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.

The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.

This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list."
3,Boriiiiiiing,One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. All these good reviews they must have watched a different movie than I did. Just a bunch of crap and talking which you can hardly understand cuz one guy talks with his mouth full the whole movie and then a lot of Italian. Just a really suckkkky movie.
10,A view from the other side of life.,"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.

The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.

The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.

The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones."
10,Filming of Horse's Head Scene,"I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island. One was the new version of ""Sabrina"", starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks..."
10,a classic when first released; only improves with age,"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
10,LOVED IT,WILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIEWILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIEWILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIE.
10,ONE OF THE BEST EVER!,"AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic."
10,For an iconic day of fun,"It's still one of the most iconic films today.

And it's fun for modern people to!

So you can watch it with every friend you want."
7,"Overrated, but still good","I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.

The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.

The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring."
5,Never understood the hype,"The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much."
10,A masterpiece,"Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.

A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.

This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing."
9,"The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.

The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.

Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.

This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.

The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.

A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though."
10,THE crime epic of the 20th century.,"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.

Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.

The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.

But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.

The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.

In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.

It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.

It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.

Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.

10,The best film in movie history,"What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10."
10,Truly a Masterpiece,"This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."
5,"Not great, merely very well made","The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way."
10,The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.

When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.

Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.

The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.

Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.

The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.

In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.

The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.

So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.

Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies."
10,Masterpiece,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.

You can't miss this movie."
10,Amazing Movie,"This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes."
7,Dog Eat Dog...,"It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.

The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.

Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.

I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile."
3,"List of things which are more entertaining than watching ""The Godfather""","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.

You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.

I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive."
10,Classic Masterpiece,"A must watch movie for all about the inner workings of a mafia family. Brilliant performance by Marlon Brando.

Also, heard about the trickery with the Dark Knight from a German and this movie deserves justice."
10,The Godfather indeed!,"The Godfather is truly the godfather of movies. Whether its the acting, the music, the cast, screenplay...everything is spot on and credit to Francis Ford Coppola for not only directing this but also choosing to stick with a new comer like Al Pacino where as the production wanted a household name, casting Brando and setting the story in New York despite being nearly fired on 3-4 occasions. And boy did it pay off, They would go on to earn their own Oscar nominations and wins for ""The Godfather."" The movie is.3 hours long & slow paced but still there is no dull moment in the movie. A treat for movie lovers with legends of cinema."
10,The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!,"The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate."
9,What impress me most of Godfather,"What impress me most of Godfather At the wedding, I remembered, after telling the story of his family, Michael said to his girlfriend: ""that's my family, Kay. It's not me."" However, at the end of movie, he closed the door to let Kay outside."
9,GOOD MOVIE,"I LIKE IT. A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.

From the aspects that have been reviewed, the author states that the film The Godfather truly deserves to be the king of mafia-themed films. The plot is neat and the storyline is not boring. The acting quality of the actors and actresses is not half-hearted. The use of props is also total (that horse's head, you know!) and also music that suits the theme being carried. If The Shawshank Redemption had never existed, perhaps the one that would be in first place right now would be this film. Two thumbs don't seem to be enough to appreciate the masterpiece of director Francis and also Mario Puzo as the author of the novel. Salute!"
7,Would Watch Once,"G: i personally would say 8 out of 10 but the movie does drag on which is why i have to rate it a bit lower C: Heard too much about movie so expectations were set too high, disappointed seemed over-hyped. 7 out of 10."
4,What?,How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.
9,Amazing movie,It's a movie from which I have learned many things about life.
10,The greatest movie ever made.,"02/04/2019

The Godfather (1972)

Director - Francis Ford Coppola

Cast - Marlon Brando & Al Pacino

Based on the Classic novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo, this movie is a resounding masterpiece in the field of arts & entertainment. So what makes it the greatest movie ever made. Is it the background score that stirs your soul every time it plays. Is it the detailed direction by the master Coppola that not only takes you through the character's journey or the timeline but also helps you unravel deep rooted mysteries of the human psyche. Is it the alluring cinematography by Gordon Willis that makes every frame in the movie look like the most fascinating visual a human eye can ever stand witness to. Or is it the Masterclass in Acting given by a Brando as the iconic DON Vito Corleone & furthermore an even better performance by Al Pacino in not only the best role of his acting career, but also the most iconic character ever created on celluloid as Michael Corleone. I guess this is the problem with this film, that all the creative geniuses in the field of Arts & Entertainment got their A game on & filled it with so much of class, passion, performance & excellence, that the film did not have an option but to be the best film in the world of cinema."
10,Epic,"This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The perfects book's perfect adaptation. The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing. And don't forget Nino Rota's melodies which are inseparable from the movie."
10,A True Classic,"This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot"
10,"The best Gangster film ever made, Possibly the best film ever made.","The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him."
7,Stylish classic a head of its time,"A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full."
3,Let's Get Down To The Facts,"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous."
9,"Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.

The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.

The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.

Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.

As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.

Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see."
10,Best Movie Ever.,"The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie."
9,"""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.

Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.

The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the film

This is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.

The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.

The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.

Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.

Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.

My Grade: A-"
10,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.

The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.

The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.

7,An overrated classic.,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable."
4,Tedious beyond belief,"I have attempted to get through this film on 4 separate occasions. All I hear are good things and how it's the best of the best. However, I can't get through it. There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don't care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don't see it."
10,A work of art.,"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.

Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.

To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker."
10,Best film ever made,"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.

This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10"
9,"Oh, Those Corleones....","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.

And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.

Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.

Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.

Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.

Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).

Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"
10,"I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Give ""The Godfather"" 10 stars.","I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.

I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.

I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.

The best movie ever"
10,The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures,"Greetings from Lithuania.

To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie many times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again. Rewatching it recently on 4K UHD disk kinda blew me away the fact of how incredible it looks.

There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.

Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.

Overall, because you have probably already seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that a cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years."
10,The Godfather is a good movie,"I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also."
6,Showy and shallow,"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend."
4,"Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.

All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.

And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.

The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.

The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.

Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.

Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output."
9,What is there to say?,"Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.

There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.

Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.

Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece."
10,The King Of Mob Movies,"The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10."
10,Great movie,Great movie. This is the type of movie you just want to watch time and time again. A real classic.
10,Look how they massacred my boy,"The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.

The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia ""order."""
9,This was an Awesome movie which i ever watched in my life,"First time i saw this movie i did not understand the actual realty of movie and characters acting was speech less. Rest i can said when i saw and understand this movie after my 5th 100% successful attempt to watch full movie then i realize this was the awesome movie i need to buy original, and well be in my personal collection . Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.

fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless. We all knows we well not again see to like this kind of level of movie in any decades hats off to all super actors in the movie."
10,Perfection on film (with Godfather II as it's worthy companion piece ... Godfather III - Good not great.),"To the (few) giving poor revues ... be very careful. It'll be a late night knock on your door or an invitation for coffee from an old 'friend' or maybe you'll be in a cinema watching Shawshank Redemption, then KAPOW! You'll be nothing more than a red smudge on the wallpaper.

You must never go against the family.

Correct your revue now or it will be you who's 'corrected'."
9,"A little over rated, but I know good film making when I see it","I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget ""The Godfather"".

9/10"
7,Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.,"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.

Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.

Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.

The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.

It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one."
4,Blind overvaluation.,"The film has been hailed as the most successful mafia film ever, from the time of its release to the present. Some have even called it the greatest film of all time. I went into this film with high expectations. As it turns out, the film does not have enough content to fill its long running time, and I got bored while watching it. There are some highlights, but it is not worthy of a high rating. In my opinion, since everyone gave the film a high rating, the newcomers agreed with them, and even though they felt inwardly that the film was not very interesting, they thought, ""But everyone else gave it a high rating, so there must have been some good scenes in the film. Yes, that scene was good. That line was good. After all, this is a masterpiece, as everyone says!"" I feel that they are evaluating the film with a kind of blind evaluation. Well, I have read commentary articles on this film and found some interesting scenes, and I have thought, ""So that's what that was about...!"" But it doesn't have enough impact to raise my evaluation of the film."
10,Such a freaking classic.,"Don Vito Corleone: ""You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?"".

The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is."
8,"""He is a good godson.""","This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.

On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.

The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.

As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.

Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.

4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"
10,Execlent movie but short changed the book,"This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many ""books""(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made."
10,"Movie , which is unparalleled .","Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".

If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.

Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it."
10,This is what i call a MOVIE,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen,the way they directed it was really good and actors have performed very well in their own characters"
10,Brando in the most charismatic performance of all time,"The movie has it all, and everything is handled to perfection.

The plot is so intriguing, one never gets bored.

The performances are top notch, especially Marlon Brando(the MOST CHARISMATIC PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME), Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan.

HIGHLY recommended for anyone who has missed the best movie ever made."
10,A must watch especially with director's commentary,"Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.

Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.

Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.

When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.

From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies I'm sure you'll experience the same."
8,"It is great, but hardly the best","I finally set out to take three hours to watch ""the best movie ever"" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.

8/10"
7,Definitely not a masterpece,"I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion."
9,"A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.

For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.

This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.

My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills."
10,the best film in history of cinema,"I Think this film is best in cinema history.one awesome film. alpacino was great in film i like his play Brando was strong kind and square!

godfather best dialoge:

Luca Brasi: Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. Don Corleone: I'm gonna make him an offer he won't refuse. Clemenza: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. Michael: Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now. I'm with you now. I'm with you. Michael: My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Kay Adams: Do you know how naive you sound, Michael? Presidents and senators don't have men killed. Michael: Oh. Who's being naive, Kay? Don Corleone: You talk about veangance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you or my boy to me? Peter Clemenza: Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Michael: Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. Michael: Barzini is dead. So is Phillip Tattaglia. Moe Greene. Stracci. Cuneo. Today I settled all family business so don't tell me that you're innocent. Admit what you did...Get him a drink. Don't be afraid, Carlo. Come on, you think I'd make my sister a widow? I'm Godfather to your son...Go ahead. Drink. Drink. No, you're out of the family business, that's your punishment. You're finished. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas. Tom?...I want you to stay there, you understand?...Only don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry. Now, who approached you first? Barzini or Tattaglia? Michael Corleone: Don't ask me about my business!!"
10,The ultimate scriptwriting inspiration.,"As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever."
9,What an outstanding cinema work,"The first movie I've ever watched that left me with the feeling that I saw something bigger than just a movie. I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that's what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can't refuse!"
10,Best Movie ever done (My Opinion),"In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.

If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. With 175 minutes running time the movie is quite long, but I promise it is worth it."
10,Outstanding performance,"First, I've read and heard about this movie for a looong time before I watched it, and I heard alot of people talking about how they are crazy about this film, I couldn't know why all these people are talking about this movie as it is an invention that changed the history of cinema??all of these questions in my head had stopped suddenly when I watched it , I can't think of better performance for the whole line of actors like this one, what shocked me to the depth of my heart actually is that you are confused about who is the best actor in this masterpiece?? The Don,Micheal,santino, clemenza or even Bonasera in the very iconic intro scene. The characters, the cinematography, the sound track looks fabulous . I can't really imagine how Francis Coppola managed to gather all this cast together most of them were unknown to us. This movie is really a masterpiece and it is a reference for acting, directing, writing and everything else in the cinema business."
6,I think it's Overrated film,"Not worth to present in top 10 Popular Movie, yesss i know it's Impossible to ignore the performance and evaluation of characters via marlon Brandon and Al pacino Both are Incredible actors, but the long period of movie is boring, there is a lot of Scenes Not important."
10,Family Business,"As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.

Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful ""justice"" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised ""in the American fashion"") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:

I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but - I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian...Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal...She was the light of my life - my beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again...I-I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison - suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'"
10,Simply put its a masterpiece,One of the greatest stories ever told through film. From the cinematography to the cast there isn't a single flaw.The performance by Marlon Brando is just stunning and Al Pacino amazes with his talent with this being one of his first movies. The legacy of this movie and the way it has affected cinema cant be described in words. Being a fan of organized crime movies I can say that this is my absolute favorite and I cant remember how many times I have watched it.It might be a bit long but It never ceases to amaze the viewer with its brilliant dialogue and excellent cinematography.I would like to thank personally everyone who worked on this achievement of a film. A must see for everyone who has even the slightest appreciation for cinema!!!
10,Couldn't get any better than this...,"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!"
10,Good,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.

The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
10,One of the greatest movies ever made,"This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier.

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.

The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.

Do not miss this movie!"
10,Excellent,"you need to watch it to understand how excellent this movie is.

It has a great story, actors, acting and is a piece of art.

This was my first English movie and loved it and still do. Never will get tired of watching it.

""Don't ever take sides against the family again, ever and Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgement.""

Many quotes and words that actually make sense, its not a wordless and nonsense argument. It can be extreme but some of the quotes do make sense.

Watch, See, Listen, and enjoy."
10,I love it,"I liked it a lot. It's truly a masterpiece. I thought he cast was well priced and he director did a phenomenal job at directing this film. I also think the sequel is as good as the first, if not better. If I could give this film more than 10 stars right now, I honestly would. I remember going with my boyfriend to see it, for it is his favorite film. He laughed and cried and wanted to see it again and again. I am the same exact way. I not only likes this movie, but I loved it, and I still do. Even now when I see a grandfather clock I always think of this movie. Actually, writing this review right now is giving me so many amazing and beautiful memories of the movie that I want to go and see it again. I would truly recommend see this movie as soon as possible. I'm sure you wouldn't regret it. It made me the person I am today."
7,A Slow-Burning Epic with Sky-High Expectations,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a film that carries the weight of cinematic history. Its reputation precedes it, and expectations soar as high as the towering peaks of Mount Everest. But does it live up to the hype? Let's delve into the details.

The Slow Pace:
The film's deliberate pacing has been both its strength and its Achilles' heel. Some viewers might find it too leisurely, akin to savoring a fine Italian meal over several courses. Scenes unfold gradually, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the world of the Corleone family.

However, for those accustomed to fast-paced action, ""The Godfather"" can feel like a languid river winding through time. The tension builds incrementally, and patience is required to appreciate its nuances.

When you approach a classic like ""The Godfather,"" you carry with you the collective weight of critical acclaim, awards, and cultural impact. It's like stepping onto a grand stage where every note must be pitch-perfect.

Unfortunately, this burden can sometimes overshadow the experience. We anticipate fireworks at every turn, but instead, we get quiet conversations in dimly lit rooms. The film's brilliance lies in these subtleties, but they may not satisfy everyone.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic. His wheezy voice and deliberate movements convey a lifetime of power and cunning. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone brings depth to his transformation from reluctant heir to ruthless strategist.

The tension hangs thick in the air-the smell of cigars, the dimly lit offices, and the hushed conversations-all contribute to an atmosphere that envelops us.

Yet, this deliberate approach can alienate viewers seeking instant gratification.

""The Godfather"" strips away the glitz and glamour associated with mobster films. Instead, it reveals the raw underbelly-the power struggles, betrayals, and blood-soaked loyalties.

The mafia isn't romanticized; it's portrayed as a ruthless business where family bonds are both strength and vulnerability.

Over all, ""The Godfather"" is like a fine wine-one that requires patience to savor fully. If you're willing to embrace its measured pace and peer beyond the surface glamour, you'll find a masterpiece that transcends mere entertainment.

Note: While some may find it slow-paced, others consider it a methodical masterpiece. 🎥🍷"
5,"Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.","I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.

This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years."
10,The best movie,"One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema.

The Godfather is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies, one of the most important films in history, the most commented, imitated and revered in cinema. And is the question: is the best movie ever? When we stop to think about days after seeing the movie we were in doubt, but to watch no doubt of the answer. Almost like an offer we can't refuse. Note: 10"
10,Inspiring movie,"Just an amazing movie with an awesome script! One of the best stories ever told. The way this story is told is something that I couldn't expect, with so much drama but also the reality of that world. We feel so connected with the family, with the characters. The photography increase the drama of the movie. Like the last take, we want so much to see how his going to be with all that power. Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It's also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different. Very honest with the book. Almost three hours that we can't feel. I wish there were more movies like this these days."
10,"The strongest movie ever made ""The Godfather""","I saw this movie and i fell in love with it. It is the strongest movie i have ever seen .This movie gave a clear and transparent view of ""The Mafia Family"".This movie defines what cinema is(are).Four Thumbs Up!!!! for ""The Godfather"" and i hope everybody who watches this movies falls in love with it. Marlon Brando,i got no words for his appreciation what shall i tell him ""The Real Godfather of Actors"" yes that would be very less to call him so he is above that also. He was born to do Don Vitto Corleone and Don Vitto Corleone was written for him only.Al Pacino,ah what a strong Performance speechless,boundless loved him as Michael Corleone The real Son of The Godfather just can say this.and James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diana Keaton are also the important part without them ""The Godfather"" would be incomplete.just wanna say watch it"
10,"Definitely, a great film!","""The Godfather"" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values of life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy. This is my favorite movie."
10,Great Movie,"Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting."
10,It never gets old!,"This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.

When we can't pick a movie to watch, me and my friends just instinctively settle for ""The Godfather"". We know each and every dialogue and we love saying the dialogues verbatim!

Besides, what other movie has so many great actors doing their best work? Where else will you find someone beating Al Pacino at acting then in this movie?

This movie just never gets old for me and my friends. And that is why it deserves a 10 star vote!"
10,Perfect,"This movie is simply perfect. Whether it's the acting, scenery, pacing or anything else, it's all just so brilliantly executed. Every scene is so memorable, that I just can't think of any reason to rate this movie lower than a 10/10."
8,Great But Overrated Movie!,"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.

This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.

The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.

The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.

One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.

Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10."
5,When did overacting become art?,"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.

There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron."
10,Simply amazing,"This has to be a masterpiece for me and for my understanding and knowledge. I adore mob films like this one and TV series about the mob as the great TV series I've ever watched: The Sopranos. The shooting of the whole film is sublime, and the shots of the two sequels as well. Coppola got to manage this as a master of film composing. The plot and the development in general is majestic too. The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that. Now I can only say that this has become one of my favorites films ever (for me and for most of you who are reading this). This is the sort of films that I would watch for many times."
10,"Great movies are not born great, they are made great.","I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".

This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).

With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.

It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.

All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie."
10,Review,"The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."
10,The best!,"I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!"
10,Mafia 101,"The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history."
7,One of the most iconic gangster films.,"The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families.

Filmed with a much dark and eerie atmosphere, the cinematography captures the grimness and sinister elements of the gangster era, like a film-noir movie. The plot goes at a steady pace, capturing in detail the height of Don Corleone's life from his daughter getting married to the many people turning to him for advice and help in dealing with the nefarious activities occurring in their lives. The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.

A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.

Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom. But overall, it's a pretty good movie, very dramatic and sinister - perfect for crime drama movie fans.

Grade B"
4,The most overrated movie of all-time..,"I watched this movie three times in an attempt to see why such a poorly written, directed, and acted movie is so revered by fans and critics alike. Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed. And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid. The only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them. And the mafia forced critics to praise this title by placing severed horse heads in their beds!"
10,A Landmark in Film,"Well what superlatives can i give a movie that probably has had them all. This film is and will remain a classic in any era. Up step Al Pacino, from virtually nowhere this actor, amongst a frighteningly illustrious cast, absolutely blows them away and gives a performance that has given him legendary status.

Everything about this movie, form the acting, to the direction to the sound track is perfect in every sense of the word. Most people that have not seen the movie will probably think of it as a classic gangster movie, but it so much more then that, family, love, romance, revenge all this in one movie is truly remarkable.

For me this movie is my all time favourite it gets better every time I watch it and it rightly deserves to be at the top of the all time movies"
10,Really one of the greatest films ever made...,"The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.

This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.

The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think ""How the heck did they come up to this idea?"" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.

This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry. You'll miss more than half of your life not watching it. :)"
10,Best movie of all time,"One of the best movies I have ever see, and I love it everything about this movie. Nothing in this movie is too much, every scene in the movie is perfect. The movie is with best cast ever, best directing, good story. It is about crime, family and their relationship. The best thing about it is that movie don't have any flaw. The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D"
10,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""","Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.

With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.

In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but ""The Godfather"" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.

The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the ""good boy"" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.

Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.

The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor."
10,A beautiful film,"I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife ""Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?"" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse."
7,Not for me,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and holding an unforgettable place in cinema history, is a masterpiece. The film focuses on the Corleone family's involvement in the world of crime, while also exploring themes of family values, loyalty, and power.

The film stands out with a deliberate yet profoundly impactful pace. By delving into character development and the intricacies of relationships, it presents the audience with a rich and poignant narrative. Marlon Brando's unforgettable performance as Don Vito Corleone breathes life into the characters.

The theme of ""power"" is one of the central elements of the film. The complexity behind the Corleone family's criminal empire, the challenges of the pursuit of power, and ethical dilemmas prompt viewers to contemplate. Additionally, the family's loyalty and devotion form the deeply explored emotional dimension of the film.

Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, ""The Godfather"" boasts a highly intricate plot. This richness contributes to the film's captivating and immersive quality. The meticulously crafted atmosphere and attention to detail create an intense world, allowing viewers to intimately experience the underbelly of the criminal underworld and the characters' internal conflicts.

However, the film's deliberate pace might test the patience of some viewers. The in-depth character development and intricate web of relationships might not satisfy those expecting fast-paced action.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" remains a masterpiece, despite its deliberate pace, due to its intricate narrative and rich character depth. Addressing universal themes such as power, family values, and loyalty, it has secured a significant place in cinematic history."
3,Solid characters with long boring sequences between memorable instances of action,"I decided to give this movie a go after seeing it in the #2 spot in the IMDB top 250 list.

This movie establishes the characters well, and all of the acting in this movie seemed top notch, with even small character roles being portrayed convincingly throughout the film.

Unfortunately, a large portion of the film contained long scenes that caused me to rapidly lose attention or become sleepy. The excessive amount of time (eg. The first 30 mins at the wedding) does not do well to set the pace of the film - instead lulling the audience into a dozy stupor in which many viewers would be tempted to jump on their phone.

The notable parts of this movie are the parts where action happens: the tense encounter with the police chief, the scene at the boom gates, the emotional garden scene with the don/grandson. These are the noteworthy parts of the film where the cast are finally given a chance to flex their talents.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other low reviewer's summaries when I say this movie is overrated. While it may have been a great movie in the 1970's, or even 1980's, this movie is less likely to earn a 10 star review in 2021, and more likely to give you a three hour nap on the sofa."
10,"""I believe in America""","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.

A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.

Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."
10,The Best,"The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release.

It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best."
10,Wonderful,"Es they are worth watching. If you like the slow dramas, then the Godfather is for you. There isn't A LOT happening, as in not much action, a lot of talking. But superb acting and an impeccable story."
9,The Godfather,"Whether it's acting or the use of lens or music, it gives people a kind of beautiful enjoyment. The film is in great need of deep appreciation."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece of Power and Loyalty,"The Godfather is not just a film; it's an immersive experience into the heart of family, power, and loyalty. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this 1972 masterpiece has stood the test of time, remaining as relevant today as when it first hit cinemas. What's striking is its balance of grandeur and intimacy-there's an almost operatic scale to its portrayal of the Mafia, yet at its core, it's about family dynamics and the personal costs of power. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of iconic, his presence a masterclass in subtlety and gravitas. The film's dialogue is steeped in a quiet menace, with memorable lines that have become part of the cultural lexicon. Its pacing and cinematography are flawless, drawing the viewer into its world with an atmosphere of inevitable tragedy. The Godfather isn't just a film to watch-it's one to live and breathe."
10,The GODFATHER,"This film shows an Italian Mafia Carleone headed by Don Vito, The Godfather. You are lucky if he is your friend, but if he is your enemy then you are dead. The film starts with his daughter's wedding introducing all other characters. Here comes our main lead Micheal who is a simple guy who doesn't want to get involved in the family business. There are other Mafia families equally powerful to Don Vito's family. One guy Sollozzo, who wants to start his drug business under the protection of Godfather. But Don Vito who is a good mafia rejects this deal as drug business is against his principles. This act of rejection starts a gang war among mafia families involving great atrocities which affects even the Corleone family. Micheal also gets involved in this war due to family emotions and other reasons. This movie is a great piece of art with great acting, action, drama and with spices of surprises."
9,Best film ever,"I love this film, great to watch, every scene is a fantastic experience Great to watch"
7,Good film,"Although I think that this movie is slightly overrated (forgive me for saying that). I did love this movie though! It had a good plot and the acting was great. The length of this movie didn't bother me, if anything I think it added to it. I don't think this movie deserves to be in the top two, definitely in the top 10 though."
5,Over Rated,"This is over done and over rated. It sucks.

It just doesn't make any sense why people like one crime film so much. There are so many good motion pictures out there, and out of all of them, people pick this one? Honestly Francis Ford Coppola is over rated, and he makes lots of trash films."
10,Perfection,Truly one of the best movie series in the world. Great quality acting and script... It's impossible to forget. This will never happen again. Don Vito Corleone.
10,"You say Shawshank, I say The Godfather.","I grew up in the 90s, this is not me being biased. This is me telling the truth. The Godfather is and will always be the best movie ever made, objectively speaking. Some of you might think it's a little slow and I guess it is but it kind of has to be. You can't rush a movie like this, it needs to be slow to get it's message across. When looking at it from the right angle it's actually perfectly paced. Every scene is done to absolute perfection and I couldn't find a single weak link in the acting.. Or a single production error. People have been trying to debunk this movie for 50 years but no suceeded. It's as close to flawless as the movie industry will ever get.

Shawshank is higher rated and I understand why, it's more casual friendly and not as heavy on details as The Godfather. But in terms of objective quality it really does not get any better than this.

10/10 is an understatement. We need a new rating system.. Best movie ever made, hands down."
10,"Pulls you In immediately, keeps you there. The best.","My father would watch this on vhs, recorded off cable, often. He was born in the 30s, grew up during the depression and world war 2. This film depicts an America that he lived through and with authenticity. Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece here. Attention to every detail pays off. A master class in storytelling. Think of Enzo the baker. A minor scene in the very beginning regarding Enzo is actually an introduction to an important element at the scene at the hospital. Enzo shows up to bring flowers and Michael uses him to help ward off assassins, which leads to McCluskey assaulting Michael and in turn leads to.... Well, you know. A film as well written, well acted, well filmed, paced etc. As The Godfather is as rare as anything. Hyperbole aside, this is a true twentieth century American masterpiece in film making. Every film that came after it owes a debt of gratitude. Deserving of all the praise that had been bestowed upon it."
10,One man told me once it's bad movie. Now he sleeps with fishes. That's a true story.,"When you see it on TV, you get the offer you can't refuse. Godfather is the greatest movie ever. Acting, music, directing, photography, everything is perfect. Movie without a mistake. Real masterpiece."
9,Classic crime,"The movie is very old. When I watched this movie, I was still young. I didn't understand the truth. When I grew up and watched it again, I really had a taste"
10,My mate Leigh...,"My mate Leigh hasn't seen this film. I was a bit confused when he told me like but I thought I'd drop his review on anyhow. Leigh isn't gonna watch this film because everyone sez he should, but he's from Yorkshire and them lot are reyt stubborn.

Anyhow, it's an alright film about some lads who do some stuff, some of em die, some of em don't. But I suppose that's just life really."
9,Movie of legends.,It's one of those movies that I watch over and over again over the years. It is a masterpiece that even the new generation prefers to watch. Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan Performances are amazing.
10,"Never before, never again....","They say lighting never strikes twice and, while I hope that it isn't true in film as it isn't true in nature, I don't know that we'll ever see a movie up to the caliber of The Godfather again. The writing, directing, acting, soundtrack, cinematography....everything about the film is an A+. I've seen it so many times and I'm such a movie buff that I've made it my life's goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty. I've heard the runtime criticized, but there are no superfluous parts to the movie that deserve cutting. I can only hope that we someday see a film that measures up, but won't hold my breath. Bravo."
7,"Way ahead of its time, but.......","First let me admit I'm very late to the party but being laid up in bed gave me a spare 3 hours

Its a good film no doubt, amazing in 1972 with a great story and steller cast

But the death scenes are horrible James Caan get hit with 20 bullets and still gets out of a car and I could go on and on and on

I just don't think it stands up to modern viewing and maybe that's my fault for being so late to the party but that is my view of it

The are some great performances in it no doubt but to say its in the top three films of all time for me is a stretch

For me it'll go in the folder of watched it and will probably never watch it again

Ciao."
10,This is the best of all the movies I ever seen,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself."
8,This movie is strong,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent amusement, and over the top commanding. It's hard to fine a movie done this well, it's 29 times old and has progressed well. Indeed if the bystander doesn't like cabal type of pictures, he or she'll watch the entire film, the cult is fused to what will be next as the film progresses. Its about, family, fidelity, rapacity, connections, and real life. This is a great blend, and the cultural style make the film memorable."
10,Great of all the times,"It was like your building a high tower, and with the rules of construction to do something like that you must start with a solid tough base can hold the weight and levels. Godfather was written first with a unique way, that made you more interested to see the man's life, who can change you life, or even make your life in past with a word. For me it started with the DOP, with the amazing picture. Decoration, accessories, the site, and really the performance of all these stars together. Music was amazing and much matching the time of the movie, specially when you do your search of the music of that time. Last and least, the Director, who controlled all of his tools and made this great movie, i never felt bored of watching it."
8,An excellent foray into the world of crime,"The Godfather is an iconic movie about a young man taking over the crime family, it's a beautifully executed film about depravity, suffering and desperation.

The pacing is quite thoughtful and despite the long runtime it never really feels dull. The actors bring their A-game here and the main characters are quite well written. Visually it looks very good for the time though some scenes are a bit stiff. The tension the writers are able to portray is masterful and the dialogue is meaningful.

Some scenes cut too quickly to each other and it can feel very disorienting, especially when it concerns a time jump. The movie is perhaps a little too long and could benefit from a few scenes being shortened.

Overall The Godfather is a classic for a reason it's a thought-provoking drama with excellent tension and twists. It's overrated for sure but that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece of the time."
10,One of the greatest movies ever,"After 50 years, this movie is still going strong! The cast produced a superb performance. Ford Coppola made it all possible. I can watch this movie again and again...A Masterpiece for many more years to come."
10,10/10,"Really like this one. Must watch for any fans off mafia films. Will watch again.

#godfather #mafia"
7,Highly overrated,"This movie is a great piece of work no doubt about that. The acting is natural, the direction is good and cinematography even better. When they say that every frame is a painting...they mean it. And the brilliantly exicuted deaths of whoever dies in this movie. But The problem is that it didn't match the hype for me. It was suggested to Me by my friend and he said that this was the best movie he had ever saw. As he had seen a lot of movies I decided to watch this movie. This movie is boring in some parts and not completely interesting throughout. I finished this movie in 5 sittings. The scenes are unnecessarily dragged for no reason at all. And I tried hard to really root for the characters which didn't happen in my case. The bgm is great.....but to use the same bgm again and again got me irritated.

Overall great movie but highly overrated and boring"
1,The Godawfulfather,"This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this ""movie"". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10."
10,Almost Perfect,"This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie."
9,absolutely a masterpiece,"Visuals, story, acting, directing, musics... this is basically the maximum directors can reach. shawshank redemption is a great movie but it's lacking in many such as visuals. If I meet an alien and they ask me what's the best movie you guys ever made, I would give them this and say second one is almost as good as the first one."
9,Excellent,Terrific trip into the world of the Corleone's! Enjoyed all 3 hours!
9,Great Movie,"Don Vito Corleone: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Don Vito Corleone: Revenge is a dish best served cold. Don Vito Corleone: ""A friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults"
10,wow!,"id just like to say that i think that this film is fantastic. i was never interested in in before and thought that it would be rubbish- i was wrong! i had to watch it for my film studies A-level and am so glad that i did, as i would have otherwise missed out on a great film. the film as a whole is amazing, but my favourite part is when Solozzo is murdered by Michael. i believe that this scene is shot fantastically, especially in the way that it creates tension and suspense and the audience is unsure as to whether or not Michael will actually do it. this is the first step that Michael makes to becoming involved in the gangster world. i also love the closing sequence of this film, when Michael has Carlo killed. once again this scene was shot fantastically, especially the way in which the light was positioned on Michaels face. this was that half was dark and the other light. i believe that this was to show how Michael had changed as a character, and that he was now fully apart of the gangster world, being the Don en' all. you can now see that Michael is a cold and heart-less character, and at the very end when the door is shut on his wife Kate this leaves the audience wanting to know what happens next. i haven't watched the godfather part 2 yet, but i know i have too as apparently it is even better than this film, which i find hard to imagine. but i cant wait to see how Micheal's life develops."
9,LEGENDARY,This is one of very few movies that shook the film industry !!
9,One of the Best Movies Ever Made,This film has an amazing everything. Amazing acting. Amazing plot. Amazing characters. Amazing writing. This movie I could re watch hundreds of times and it would never get old. It's too good!
10,Cult Classic,Marlon Brando's One Man Show. Best Direction And Screenplay. Al Pacino's Performance at his Best. Best Gangster Movie Ever.
6,I did not care for the god father,"Alright so here's how I feel. I got the same exact feeling when I watched pulp fiction, I've been told it's this masterpiece and that it's one of the best movies ever and then I watch it and... it's not. To be honest it's kinda boring maybe it's just me idk. Here's the thing there's definitely something here like at one point or another I'm gonna rewatch this movie and maybe then it'll be good. I can tell that there's definitely a good story here but this first go around I just can't see it and here the other issue it's so long like personally I don't think movies need to be this long the only movie that should be this long are movies similar to end game like thrilling conclusion movies with a bunch of loose ends to tie up. Something like this it just drags and gets confusing so quickly I constantly had to pause and go back and ask questions like something about this movie doesn't click with me and I really want it to just don't get it and I wish I did and maybe one day I will but today is not that day."
4,"Not That Great, What're People Smoking?","I saw this movie twice. It's an alright movie but really has no

exceptional value. Certainly not as much as everyone seems to

think. I believe people heap praise upon it because other people

TELL them this is the best movie ever. I say to those people grow

a backbone and watch some better movies."
9,A clasic,This movies is pure class. I only am going to say you must whach it.
10,Priceless,There are no words to explain how good is this movie
10,One of the greatest movies ever made,"This movie is special to me, when I was a kid I tried to watch this movie and I couldn't even finished it. The Godfather bored me so much back then. When I was talking to my friends I was saying this movie is overrated not worth to watch. 1 or 2 years ago I watched this movie again from the start and it really affected me differently. And this year I watched it again because I wanted to see Godfather II, I didn't forgot the first movie but, I just wanted to watch again and here is my thoughts.

This movie is one of the movies I call life changing. You can say 'how can a mafia movie change a life?'. This movie is not just a mafia movie, it shows us how good was the everything working back then, you should give respect to earn respect. You should be respectful to others, you should protect your family and you should love them more than everything. You should show your love to them. This movie shows manners really well. I don't know anything about mafias but I like this concept and I think this is the most realistic mafia movie, they don't do slaughters every day they just do what they need to do to protect their business or family. Concept is great.

Acting and casting is just unbelievable. It's perfect, there is nothing to talk.

Michael is really decent character in first movie, I can't talk about the other 2 movies because I didn't watched them yet. I think Tony Montana is great too but Michael better for taking an example.

Every scene was really fun and they did great job on locking you to movie. For me best scene was the baptism scene in church, its in my top 3 best scenes of all time.

I never gave a 10 to a movie but this movie is a 10. It's just perfect, rewatchable even if it's a long movie it don't feel like it. Everybody should see this movie at least 1 time or 2. But my advance is watch this movie when you are 18+. Not because it's full of gore or bad language, it's for you to understand the movie properly. I know I didn't write my review properly but this is because I can't explain how good this movie is."
10,"BeatlesFan3287 Reviews ""The Godfather""","When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.

Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.

The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time."
9,The very best movie of all times,"I can't really describe accurately how I feel about this movie. I have seen it so many times and every time I have enjoyed it more than the previous one. The plot, the music, the actors and actresses couldn't have played better roles. This movie was even better than the book which rarely happens in with other movies. No wonder why it movie has been ranked first."
10,It Makes you an offer you can't refuse.,"The Year was 1972. The Vietnam War still had 2 more years before it was finally over, Star Wars was probably being written by George Lucas while he was prepping American Graffiti, Watergate was on American peoples minds, Russel Crowe was 8 years old and as for me...........well, i was not even a Glitch in my mothers Womb. That was the Year when a movie came out that was something Special, a movie that we still talk about today and even some might call the greatest film of all time. That was the year of The Godfather!!!!! Francis Ford Copolla directed one of the true cinema greats, and after almost 40 years, its still remains a fine example of a movie that sucks you in from beginning to end and leaves you satisfied like no other film like it. Marlon Brando 'makes you an offer you cant refuse' as Don Vito Corleone, the Head of his Family and Godfather. Brando is such a fine Actor and brings great weight to his role as the Don. Also great is James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot tempered son and Al Pacino as the young son Micheal Corleone, who at first does not want to get involved with the family Business until he has no choice. With other great actors like Robert Duvall and Dianne Keaton, the Godfather is a great ensemble that ended up winning a very deserving Best Picture at the Oscars and best Actor for Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo wrote the Screenplay, and its sizzling with Classic Lines and memorable moments. This film, like the old Cagney films before it, paved the way for some other great Gangster Flicks that came rolling along through the years after it, but this stands on the top of the Mountain as the Godfather of all them......"
10,THE MASTERPIECE,"The greatest movie of all time.

The Godfather is the most memorable, most influential, most quoted, most beloved, most discussed, most imitated, most revered and most entertaining American movie ever made."
10,Solid movie that has aged well,"Unlike a lot of older movies, The Godfather is packed with action and plot. The plot moves at lightening speed - honestly my only critique is that it moves TOO fast! Great characters, interesting plot, lots of action. While there is a small amount of racism and the entire movie is male focused, The Godfather holds up relatively well for its age."
7,There's no way this could be #1.,"After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow.

Anyway, I would have to grudgingly say that the acting is pretty good, but good acting doesn't make a movie worth seeing. As an old movie, I guess that the overall quality can't be too great. But, even with all that aside, this movie still lacks a good plot, and, maybe even more importantly, emotion. The Shawshank Redemption really made me sympathize with the characters, while this movie just made me go to sleep more quickly (it was that boring).

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Massively overrated.,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.

Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers."
9,a great work for art,"A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble. A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)"
10,Best movie I've ever watched and unfortunately probably ever will watch.,I've never seen a movie that can move me the way the Godfather could. Crime movies try so hard to attain what the godfather did but fail miserably. Unfortunately in the day and age of remakes and sequels I don't see any movie ever topping this again.
10,An incredible masterpiece!,"Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an unforgettable film. Coppola's great direction, the strong acting of Brando, A. Pacino and J. Caan are the winning ingredients of the film. An immense Brando pours all his acting genius into his role, giving Vito Corleone the appearance of a melancholic, mysterious man who, despite his criminal past, is purely respectable and honorable. Only an actor like Brando could give a mafia boss such a profound and multifaceted personality, only he could, in just a few scenes, make a character immortal. Brando's performance is the greatest of all time."
10,Best Crime Movies Ever,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).

The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.

He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972."
10,One of the Greatest Mafia movies that I ever watched,"I watched various Gangster movies, from the City of God to Goodfellas; the Godfather was one of the greatest movies I ever watched, with Brutal Killing scenes and excellent Performances."
9,What a Film!,"I have watched this film so many times now and I never for once got tired of watching it.

It's always amongst the first top 10 on the list of the all time great movies."
10,The Godfather of all movies,I think this is the best film ever done. All the actors did so well in the film..Specially Brando and Al Pacino won my heart.. I can see more than 100 times and still not boar.
10,A movie so goodYou can't refuse it,"A sumptuous piece of acting from Brando

A masterpiece of a movie

Turned Coppola into a household name along with Duvall and Pacino

Set the tone of how to do Italian mafia movies that's followed

Nothing short of phenomenal."
7,Probably - if not definitely - the most overrated movie of all time,"In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close.

The movie has been so hyped that I really was expecting to see the best movie all time when I watched it. What I saw was a decent flick with some very quotable moments, but in my mind the film has no singular or superior quality when compared to other great films. Monstrously overrated, but still a respectable movie."
1,One of those films everyone loves but no-one wants to watch.,"I follow recommendations on this site highly. I rented this movie and wanted my money back. Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end? If so, you've seen 90% of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not ""best movie ever material."""
9,"Great movie, but not really that great","I wasn't born when the movie came out, but grew up hearing how the older generations praise the film to be the greatest film ever made. And I agreed, it was deep, it was majestic. But it wasn't really as legendary as you'd expect, especially when we compare it with the movies we see nowadays. However, the movie was made in 1972 and there probably wasn't much choice back then."
10,The greatest movie EVER MADE,"This is the greatest movie ever made, I'm not joking. I have watched a lot of movies, movies with more oscars and not a single one is better than this. The story, the casting, even the soundtrack is perfect."
10,The Godfather,I first expected from this movie to be massively overrated but after I watched I was amazed. In my opinion is the third best movie ever made. It has action and you can't get bored while watching it. It's a three hours long movie but not a single minute was boring. This is definitely the best movie about gangsters and I loved the action. I also liked the fact that this movie is not all about gunshots and stuff like this. It shows us the problems that the Corleone family has to deal with and I was just amazed by the plot. It could be a little bit shorter because some scenes are unnecessary in my opinion but as I said it is definitely not boring. It gets a 10/10.
9,In the dictionary under masterpiece,"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.

I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.

This is an epic in every sense of the word.

9/10"
10,The best Movie ever made,"If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death! I cannot understand people who do not like this movie!

It is suspenseful, partly shocking, political, love story and much more... Simply the best movie of all time

If there is someone who reads this review and hasn't watched The Godfather... WATCH THIS ONE and you will agree that there is no movie that is better! Believe me! Watch The Godfather!

NOW!!!"
10,The Highest Level of Film Making,"The Godfather deserves all the love it gets with its fantastic acting, story, suspense, character development, music, and direction. This is the highest standard of film making, Francis Ford Coppola was a genius with his direction in this one and the second. This is a gangster film like no other, the perfect combination. Its like having your favorite food at your favorite restaurant in your favorite city, everything is perfect, from the front and center details to the small and minor ones."
10,Masterpiece,"Powerful acting, amazing portrayal of the mafia, outstanding script, this movie has it all"
10,Classic,This is more than a gangster movie this is a pure masterpiece.
6,"Not a bad movie, but extremely overrated","After seeing the rating of this movie, don't think that you're gonna have a good time.

A good example: ""12 Angry Men"", which is 5th in the IMDb Top 250: Even though it's a very old movie, you're gonna watch it with your eyes wide open, afraid of missing a single word of the dialogues.

This movie? You'll put it aside and go cook something while it is playing in the background.

Now, you gotta know these things before watching it:

1) It doesn't really tell anything. It has a story, but it doesn't start and doesn't end. It's just there and it's honestly pretty boring. It has no purpose, no meaning. It's not interesting.

2) You won't remember a single character a week after except the Godfather (Marlon Brando, he played great). All the other characters lack personality, motives, charisma, it feels almost like if they aren't existing. They are greyed out.

3) It has a very, very, very slow place. Now I know this doesn't necessarily make the movie bad, but in this case it just multiplies all the other cons.

This movie is extremely overrated."
1,Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.,"I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television. Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film. I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.

The second time I saw the film was in college. My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film. One evening my friend and I watched the film. The viewing once again left me unimpressed. I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation. Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.

Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare. I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants. Well, I think you know the outcome. As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.

I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way. I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow. There is no moral center.

I do not demand that a movie have morality. I do not demand that a film even have a point. I can take a film at its face value for what it is. A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire. The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.

Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza. However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst. We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it. Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.

Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men. But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous. To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.

I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know. A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas. As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it? That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".

I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie. I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger."
10,Iconic and masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola's first film in the series is still an epic, full of hypnotic acting, which reinvented mafia criminals as players in a dynastic psychodrama. This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks and he sees no other ways than to step in and fight for his family; if you watched Scarface and you liked Tony Montana, than you'd like Michael as well. This is a masterpiece and I think everyone would love Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone making the story so good."
9,One of the greatest movies of all time,Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s. This is a must watch for any person who appreciates cinema.
10,"This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.

Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.

Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.

The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.

Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.

Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.

His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.

An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence."
10,an obvious word: masterpiece,"The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.

Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well."
10,"Arguably, the greatest film of all time.","The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.

I give The Godfather a perfect:

5/5 or 10/10"
7,An Offer I Can Refuse,"I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichés. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them."
9,IT'S JUST TOO LONG,"""The Godfather"" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.

8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)"
10,A Thing of Perfection,"From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film's greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it. When you watch it, you feel like the society and the people in have descended from generations of people who have been in the ""business"".

The acting is nothing less than sensational and the music accentuates and complements the film beautifully.

Not much else can be said of perfection.

This film is a must-have for anyone who professes to watch movies and is a required viewing for cultural education."
10,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.

Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.

What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.

The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.

The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.

The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.

In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
10,Masterpiece,"No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie."
10,Brando Rex ! Godfather Marathon  28/12/08  13H30 (Screen),"The Godfather Trilogy was projected on one single day at the Paris cinematheque: 9 hours of film and 9 hours of pure delight!

I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same

Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!

What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!

So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!"
10,Cinematic Classic,"The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)

Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.

Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.

He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)"
10,"One of the greats, if not the great.","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.

The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.

With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see."
1,Bait and Switch is the Name of this Game,"Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals?

""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.

Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.)

This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.

So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart."""
8,I Know I'm In The Minority.....,"I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.

Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.

I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.

With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.

Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated"
10,Timeless classic...!!!!!,"Contains no spoiler..!!.

Firstly i must say what mind blowing performance by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.

Even after 40 years this movie doesn't get old .Based on novel by

Mario Puzo's,Francis has done beautiful job portraying greatest mob drama

of all time. Francis ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is regarded as

greatest movie of all time.And when i saw it i understood why.

Everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining.captivating. and phenomenal masterpiece!!!!.

JUST BUY THE MOVIE AND WATCH IT ...!!!"
10,Why The Godfather Rocks !!!,"I saw the movie some years back mainly due to the hype.. I liked it & would have given it 6/10 at that time..

Three years later I bought the book(accidentally).. Well just for the sake of buying something really wasn't going to read it anyway (so I thought)..

A few days later I read a few pages & started loving it.. I was hooked on to the book like a Harry Potter fan & couldn't put it down..

THEN..I watched the movie ... Then I knew why there was so much hype around the movie even after 30 years...

The movie just brought back the characters to life...

I loved it & thus the rating 9.6/10 However the movie is not as good as the book.... but I think it's as close a movie will ever get to the original.. Which by the way is a masterpiece..

The casting for the movie is flawless..You really feel that they belong in the book..

All in all The Godfather won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing (adapted screenplay) (Francis Coppola, Mario Puzo)...

The film was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards. Furthermore, it won five Golden Globes, one Grammy, and numerous other awards...

My final piece of advice...

""READ THE BOOK THEN WATCH THE MOVIE""

If you really want to enjoy it.."
10,"with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.

Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.

""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.

Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.

Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.

But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.

""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come."
10,The Godfather is so good that real life gangsters patterned themselves after the movie,"It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen."
10,"VERY good, but not the best...","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.

The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.

""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.

So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.

Enjoy, 9/10."
6,Average movie.,Don't understand what is so special about the movie. Certainly doesn't deserve to be the best movie ever.
1,A bore fest from beginning to end,I saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters. It was the first movie I seriously considered walking out of. Up to that point in my life I had never fidgeted so much in a movie. I blame the director - his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and I could hardly wait for it to be over. The whole Godfather series is vastly overrated.
10,WTF?!,"Anything below a 9+ is automatic removal of your rating privileges. This is it, Masterpiece, the GOAT, THIS IS MOVIE, THIS IS CINEMA PERIOD!!"
10,Legend İn The World,"he Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film ""auteur.""

Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and ""legitimate"" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding ""favor,"" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, ""I believe in America. America has made my fortune,"" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""

Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: ""My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.""""Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now."" ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."" And most famously of all: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""

The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.

At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.

Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten- year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (""prince of darkness"") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes – especially in the Don's home office – with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.

The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).

With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that ""crime did not pay."" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos."

The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances ever

Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.

Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.

Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:

'The best gangster film since The Godfather'

Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.

Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.

9,not the godfather of all movies,"As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.

In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time."
6,Interesting but hardly great.,"Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:

It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.

Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.

Hardly something worthy of praise.

The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film."
1,What is so great about it?,"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named ""The Best Movie of All Time."""
10,The best film ever.,"I'm a movie fan! I love most movies I see (except of, for example, ""Crash""), but, this one movie, for me, has everything a movie must have.

First off (and as John Travolta says in ""Swordfish""), it has REALISM. From the girls and the boys at the wedding (all of them seems truly Italian) to the Scene when the filmmaker found he has no legs. Everything it made truly believable. ACTING. And that's not a minor factor. Everyone acts as hell, everything is so well done. Almost impossible to believe. DIRECTING. Yes, this is one of the (if not the) best directed movies. Everything's on its place. I truly love it!

I can keep on naming good aspects of this wonderful movie, but truth is that I just can't explain why I watched this movie more than 50 times and still, every single Friday night we gather around the TV set to watch it again...

A gem I could not afford not to share with the rest..."
9,A novel of images,"Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.

""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).

""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.

""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.

""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...

A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular."
10,Awesome!,One of the greatest sagas of all time!! I've watched every single minute. The depth that writer takes is not easily written and the actors brings it to life with absolute brilliance.
10,masterpiece!,"A very good movie, a must-see! its very interesting"
10,One of the greatest,"This is one of my favorite movies. A very good cast which includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and many more. I was very moved by this story. It is a very believable movie. It's gotta be one of the best movies ever made."
10,"Where there are people, there are rivers and lakes.","The Godfather is a great movie, which not only tells about the vendetta of the gang, but also the cruel environment of human existence. Where there are people, there are rivers and lakes."
10,Just the greatest movie ever,Not many films stand the test of time but after almost 50 years this is still the gold standard of cinema. And rightfully so.
10,Timeless masterpiece,"Never understood the hype, until I took the time to watch the entire series throughout. This movie is simply incredible. From the storyline, to the filming, the composition, theme tune - everything hits hard.

A must watch for any true movie fan."
7,Not a bad movie but definitely the most overrated.,Definitely the most overrated movie ever. It's not bad but it's pretty slow. I've tried and failed to make it all the through it many times but I always fall asleep. Perfect example of a classic that's surviving on nostalgia. I'm sure for it's time it was revolutionary. Reminds me of when older folks talk about their favorite athletes from the past. Sure some of them are all time greats but let's be honest most of them just can't keep up with modern times. I'm 34 years old for reference in case I come off sounding like a child.
1,The most overrated movie of all time.,"Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.

I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either."
10,So freaking good,"Honestly, I didn't thought that a movie can live up to the praise like this movie. I watch it like a year ago, and it is what everyone says - unbelievable amazing and unique. Just a masterpiece. No other way to describe"
10,Not just a guy film.... maybe,"What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said? The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling. I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film.

The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it. However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C) It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater.

Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime. If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.

10,Best Movie ever,"This is a marvelous work, it cannot be better than that"
10,Excellent Performances,"Marlon Brando is the Father of all actors when it comes to act as a don.

The novel(which is also great) has been converted beautifully into a movie. Every detail has been taken care of.

And what to say about Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), I became a fan f him after I watched the movie.

The background score is too good. I was wondering whether i can get it from somewhere.

All in all a great casting for the film.

The best mafia movie i have ever seen. better than its following two parts."
10,This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.,"The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.

Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere."
10,Never Fails,"I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best."
6,Quantity Does Not Equal Quality,"I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.

Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.

A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.

Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.

The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.

About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)"
10,Epic Gangster Movie!!!,"""The Godfather"" is a superb movie it is all about a Gangster family and their crimes fights story business and all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.

The Direction done by ""Francis D Coppola"" is great and the acting done by ""Al Pacino"" and others were 100% Top notch.

I watched this movie recently about a year ago and I had no words describe this MASTERPIECE at that time!!!

Overall the movie was must watch and Top notch entertainment. It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!"
9,"Regarded a classic for good reason, Coppola's crime epic is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.","Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10"
10,Masterpiece,"Almost 50 years old this film is still one of the greatest ever. The depth, feeling and acting is top of the charts. For a movie 50 years old, the action scenes and violent parts keep up impressivly well. It is the ultimate film for using the cliché: You dont watch this movie, you experience it."
10,The Godfather,"The Godfather film is an excellent movie WHY? because of the drama, action and the loyalty.

The movie describes how it could be in a mafia family, both on family problems and political problems. The Godfather also gives you a picture of how a man with respect could be as Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone.

Alsow did the movie learned me something, that always love your family no matter what.

The movie haves good actors as Al Pacino and Marlyn. not only that it haves also good actions and original scenes!"
10,A complete crime drama must watch,"A classy story of italian crime family ""corleone"", story rolls around the family head vito corleone who is now not as powerful as used to be and so the son michael corleone jumps in the family business to bind the scattered things once again ! A complete crime drama, filled with music, classy dialouges and character that cannot be find in any other movie !"
10,A Masterpiece,"The Godfather is definitely one of the best films ever made. There is great acting ,and a truly great story which is very entertaining. It is exciting to watch and even if you do not like crime or criminals you will somehow like the ones in this movie. I JUST CAN""T PUT THE GREATNESS OF THIS MOVIE INTO WORDS!"
8,"Pretty good, but bore at times.","Pretty good, but a bore at times. The plot was very good and has some turns, but overall the story unfolded very slowly. Only the actors did a great job to save the day. I was also very impressed by the music, when you closed your eyes, the music alone can put you in the story."
7,Its good but Geez....,"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.

I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.

Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too."
10,ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠

'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.

Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.

The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.

'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.

Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.

For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me."
10,Timeless Mafia Film.,"Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.

Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

A masterpiece."
10,America's Masterpiece,"Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.

It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.

This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.

But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.

The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.

There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.

""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.

One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.

The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.

Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.

In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.

Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.

Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it."
10,"""Don't ever take sides against the family again.""","Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.

Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.

What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.

The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.

Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.

Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.

Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.

10 out of 10."
7,Not that great,"This movie isnt that good but it's definitely not bad. Everyone talks about this movie like it's some masterpiece but quite frankly it's boring in some scenes, got to so bored the first time watching that I stopped watching a few times that day."
1,Most overrated film of all-time,"This movie continues to be praised, but when I rented it I only made it through 45 minutes before I stopped the video. There aren't many movies that are so bad I don't watch the whole thing, but ""The Godfather"" is that bad. I don't care how much other people may like it. I still say it sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks..."
10,"Truly masterly film-making, right up there with Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.

It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.

Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)

What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****"
10,And so it begins,"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.

Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.

The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)"
10,My favorite film of all time,For me The Godfather is the best film. Everything from the music to acting and script are all perfect. The film has tons of amazing iconic lines and scenes and of course the character of Vito Corleone is amazing and Marlon Brando does an amazing job of playing him. Everything about the film is perfect.
8,Too overated.,Its a good movie but it doesnt deserve the place for second best rated movie. I have seen much much better movies with 7 rate or 8.
8,Overrated? Maybe a little bit.,"Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that."
10,A Timeless Epic,"The Godfather has become over the years a classic and many consider it to be one of the best films ever made, this is truly deserved. Everything about the film is perfect and I simply cant think of anything that shouldn't be there as every single thing screams perfection. The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn't bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others. A true classic. 10/10"
4,The hype of the movie is as interesting as the movie itself.,"Many men has called this the greatest movie ever made. I disagree, though I liked it very much. The hype of this movie is as interesting as the movie itself as it says a lot about the world we live in and the men who seek power.

I have seen and read intimidation used by people, trying to personally attack any who called this movie terrible or boring calling them stupid, while many other just jumped on the wagon calling it the greatest movie ever made to avoid such attack. A similar pattern to how physically strong, but emotionally weak men like Capone and Hitler came to power.

The movie is significant to both world and film history. I however only give the movie a 5 as by todays standard its less artistic, entertaining and original. I also did not feel there was much new or original to learn from this movie and I did not get that ""wow"" feeling. I would not have much interest to see it again.

This is one of my favorite gangster movies though and its certainly not terrible or boring. However it lacks in much of what I think a great movie should be such as: Moral points, emotion, surprise, humor, editing, cinematography, original thought, special effects, music score or even acting.(the tough guy role is not as challenging as it is to play mentally ill person)

It does also not appeal to a very broad audience (not a movie many women and children like). It was great for its time, but compared to some of todays movies is very limited in the areas of greatness.

If you like movies like old gangster movies or even tough guy movies like ""the departed"" and ""scarface"" or want to know what the hype is about. I recommend this movie it is a great movie for this genre. But it does not reach the emotional or theatrical heights of movies like ""Forrest Gump"", ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""Dances with Wolves"" or even my favorite gangster movie ""Goodfellas""."
10,This timeless masterpiece slowly grows on you.,"I've stopped watching 4 different times after the first 30mins but later one day i've decided to finish it because I've never heard great things about a film like this then happened to watch I was totally mindblown and got to know why this film is undisputed inspiration for 100's of films even after 40years of its release. It's a character driven film more than a plot driven film that's why we feel unsettling while watching the first 1 hour but as long as you travel with the characters and their emotions you can feel the magic. Can't thank enough the cast and crew for this greatest cinematic experience, I wish every movie buff will check out this film to witness how a grand masterpiece can influence their work."
8,there is a mystery about this film,"Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration.

I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota's melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...

I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don't understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them).

Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it. Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying.

I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.

My rating for the film is 8 of 10."
10,The Godfather : The Greatest Achievement in Cinematic History,"Some things are just meant to be perfect, flawless and well, godly. The Godfather , by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is . The way every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling compliments the other in this unforgettable film causes one to wonder ( really) if such a feat can be repeated, ever .

I always have the highest regard for the script before anything associated with films , therefore I'd like to talk about Godfather's screenplay first .

Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name The Godfather is all about a man's relationship with his family and his responsibilties towards it, that can cause him to abandon his own dreams and ambitions. That this setup is showcased by one of the most powerful mafia families in 1940s New York makes it all the more interesting .

The simple plot being that the head of the Corleone crime family is aging and other crime bosses want him out of the way seems rather straightforward. Enter Don Vito Corleone's youngest son Michael aka 'the innocent college boy' - as his elder brother and apparent heir Sonny Corleone likes to call him - along with a girl. He sums up his life and all that he expects from it in future in one line - ""This is my family Kay , not me. "" Quite clearly the kid wants nothing to do with his crime family or its power. But this family thrives on crime and inevitably becomes a victim as well. After Vito refuses to deal with a narcotics kingpin named Virgil Sollozo, he sets off a chain of events that alters his family and business structure forever. Even a man who has experienced all that life could offer fails to see what's coming and expresses his surprise later on.

A heartbreaking and mind numbing tale of how a powerful crime family comes to terms with all that it feeds on and how the same entities almost destroy the family was , is and will remain unforgettable .

The number of memorable scenes and dialouges is mind boggling. The scene where the Don delivers his famous line "" I'm gonna make him ......."" is enough to express the immeasurable power that the man possesses . And the one where a proud Hollywood producer awakes to find on his bed a ....... , or the restaurant where Michael ......... , or when Sonny pays the price for being hotheaded , and when the Don talks to his son , or when Michael does what he is destined to do, The Godfather overflows with great scenes.

The music and cinematography by Nino Rota and Gordon Willis respectively contribute greatly to the film's overall impact .

The Godfather can never be mentioned without naming Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the same breath. The level of acting is just ""Oh My Gosh"" . While Brando is great and very believable as Vito Corleone , Al Pacino is and will always remain the one and only choice for Michael Corleone . It is said that Brando developed the mannerisms of Vito himself and if so , then he absolutely deserves his Oscar . Al Pacino transforms Michael from the ideal son to the guy he eventually becomes making sure that one is overwhelmed by the portrayal .

Not once have i mentioned in my tribute ( i ain't that great enough to review The Godfather) that The Godfather is a person, because he isn't and as the Hindi film ' Sarkar' , influenced heavily by The Godfather , says "" The Godfather is not a man , but an idea."" Just that this idea created history.

Note: As much as i don't want to mention it , i do really feel that there is one sequence in the film that required the editor's attention. But nonetheless , it only appears as such in repeated viewings and not the first one . So set aside your coke and popcorn because you're not just watching any other flick , you are watching the greatest of them all and after the conclusion you'll realise that the coke and popcorn are as they were when the words The Godfather appeared on the screen some three hours ago ."
10,The greatest mob film ever,"The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants. Marlon Brando's performance was so superb that he won an Oscar for it. I loved this movie! If you are any movie fanatic, you should see this movie before any other."
7,Okay,"The Godfather - Crime, Underworld Movie Cast - Al Pacino, Marlon Brando

It is the highest-rated movie of all time. I found it realistic about underworld life. I have never seen any movie adapted from a very linear simple story but picturized with an awesome screenplay. The acting of every male character in this movie was top notch though all the female characters were more than dull. I liked the patience and planning of a godfather and how he deals with his enemies. There were some heavy dialogues delivered perfectly.

However, I did not like the story that much. It is more than good according to the year of its publication. But still, there is nothing to learn from this movie. This movie is enjoyable at the same time boring. The story is also predictable and there are some unnecessary scenes in the movie. I will recommend this movie as maybe this movie does not reside with my taste but others may like it so much. Finally, I found it overhyped and overrated.

Personal Rating - 6.5/10"
1,Nothing good about this movie,"One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. It felt like a Lifetime movie except for the angry wife seeking revenge it is angry men seeking revenge. The movie starts out with no back story to introduce the characters, who they are, where they are in life and a why to it all while introducing their goals or life plans. As the story progresses the characters do not grow as humans and develop more depth, to the contrary they go in the opposite direction they become less mature and even less human. They lose any depth they had and seem to be motivated entirely by revenge and greed. It is not an antihero story where the main character's motives and means is questionable but ultimately relatable and you feel if you were in the position you might or at least would be tempted to do the same, it's more of a childish jerk story where they seem to be very childish meaning impulsive, over reacting and not thought out well in terms of long term consequences. It is an incredibly slow moving movie and I just finished the movie not a full 15 minutes ago and if you were to show me a picture of a character and ask me who it is, I don't think I could tell you because the writing is so sloppy that you don't build a connection with the characters that make you care about what happens to them, as I was watching the film I was hoping for murders because it would have added some action to an incredibly slow film and because it would mean the end was nearing."
10,The definitive mob movie,"Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure."
10,Greatest film of all time.,"Many who have viewed this film consider it one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever made. The performance by Marlon Brando is legendary and iconic. The plot development and character development by far is heads above any other film that I have have had the pleasure of seeing. What in my opinion stands out above all in this film and perhaps the most understated and unappreciated film performances ever.Al Pacino played what I believe to be the most believable and powerful performance in film history. The complexity of Michael Corleone and his slow and uncontrolled spiral into the dark side of power and influence.Never before have I seen a more complete and developed performance; it is as if you see this idealistic young man forced into a life he rejected, only to become the most ruthless and feared crime figure of all time,all the while maintaining a realism and not going over the top much like the Tony Montana Character Pacino Played in Scarface. Displaying power and intimidation with minimal effort or any threatening physical attributes Pacino is able to let us as the viewers delve deep in to the soul of this tortured young man and see the birth of power hungry perverse monster who carries himself like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was a crime that this stellar performance was not awarded with the academy award. The first two films of this trilogy allows us to see Al Pacino reach the pinnacle of acting, closing out what might be considered the best overall character performance in a film series with a truly under appreciated and powerful performance in the Godfather Part III. Pacino's performance in the Godfather in my opinion is the single best performance in film history, and the Godfather is the greatest American film ever made."
8,I remember when I saw this film for the first time...,"This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.

I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.

It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder."
10,Excellent movie,"The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever. Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia. Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia. James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens. A big accident. Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director. He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here. the acting was wonderful from everybody. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, etc. everybody was awesome.

Overall this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I watch it all of the time. Rating 11 out of 10. (Tied for favorite movie)"
9,Great film making in a moral vacuum.,"A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.

The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.

Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.

I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.

Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.

Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.

Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.

We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.

The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.

(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)

Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""

Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".

The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.

Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims..."
8,One of the most over rated films,"I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons.

1. You can't understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he's wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.

2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot.

Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film.

Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long! All I can saying is that it better be more stuff going on in the movie then the first one.

8.7/10 not a bad film but a few flaws"
10,The Gopdfather: The Best Movie,"This may be regarded as the best film of the entire history of cinema, it is almost perfect in all respects, photography, script, editing, all with great technique and art at the same time, I find it significant errors.

All the performances are great, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, etc.. All individually and collectively make a masterpiece of interpretation.

The script is perhaps most shocking, the story of a reluctant to participate in the murky family business man, and the gradual change of their convictions through circumstances, recreates a picture of that violent era of U.S. history.

Photographic techniques are also impressive, not only for the beauty of the image, but also for the handling of camera you are carrying the story gets very intense feelings in the viewer.

A film that nobody should miss."
1,Not Impressed,"Over the years, I had heard a lot about this movie but, for some reason, had never seen it. About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!

Although I began watching it with high expectations, they were gone within about 20 minutes. I found it to be boring to the extreme and almost turned it off on several occasions, but I decided to stick with it in the hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't. By the time that it had ended, I was actually mad that I had wasted over two hours of my life watching it.

I realize that I'm in the extreme minority, but I absolutely did not like this movie at all."
10,"I've seen this movie, don't want to see any other in my lifetime.","The Best Movie of All times, Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are Superb. Al Pacino as the son of the Godfather rules the second half of the movie with its excellent histronics and style. How The ruthless Michael conquers the underworld empire is perhaps the most significant tales of ever times. GodFather II equally good but III simply disappoints."
8,"Doors, windows, mirrors","In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).

Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).

Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).

Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).

Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later."
10,just perfect,"What can I say about ""the godfather"" that has not been said before? That it is a masterpiece? That its staff is just wonderful? That the actors and soundtrack are superb? That it is considered one of the best films ever? Actually I don't know what more say, but it is true that it is hard to see more deserved good marks. I had never the opportunity of watching to it in original version and, when I did it, I could perfectly realize the fabulous wonder I was able to enjoy, Marlon Brando is just impressive, Al Pacino is as good as him, and James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton deserved to be congratulated. Thanks to Coppola, for giving us the pleasure of watching ""the Godfather"""
10,Anyone speak Italian?,"Anyone speak Italian who can translate the restaurant scene between Solozzo and Mike. I understand that they didn't use the subtitle in order to add to the scene's tension; but for my curiosity, I want to know what was said. Can anybody help a sista out? lol (I'm somewhat new to IMDb as far as comments go, and it's telling me that I have to have a minimum of 10 lines but I don't have anything else to say or ask so I'm just gonna keep writing this pointless stuff here. Why do I have to have a minimum of ten lines. I'm only at eight right now so I guess I have to keep writing. Yeah, now I'm at nine, one more to go. And I'm done. thanx! :-)"
10,Best movie through all times.,"The heavy storyline from ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo couldn't be better. The best acting performance you poissibly can reach, Marlon Brando does his greatest role ever as Vito. You really don't notice that the movie has some years on it's shoulders, stunning by Francis Ford Coppola. This one cannot be anything else than the highest score possible."
10,Coppola's perfection,"The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole.

It's a good thing they did, because I don't know of any other case where so much has come from so little. Everybody is perfectly cast, from Brando down the the most minute walk-on. No punches are pulled with bringing the book's content to the screen, the production design creates a perfect-looking world for it to take place in, the cinematography captures that world beautifully, and the score emotionally underscores it all magnificently.

This truly is one of the medium's pillars."
8,"More like the ""Godless"" Father....","Quite possibly the MOST over rated film in history. Never has there been so much made of so little. It is an OK movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of ""gang"" lifestyle. This movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot.

Do you know what the saddest part of this movie is? That it was remade two more times with the Godfather III being quite possible the worst remake EVER. I'm not saying you won't like the movie. It is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie. I just can't stand when movies can't stand up to their own hype."
6,Overrated,"A mate of mine loves this film, and the whole genre to boot. He made me watch this, instilling in me the notion that it was the second best film ever, behind its sequel.

Im glad I watched it, if only to argue with my mate. This film is overrated. It's good but not good enough for a top ten spot, especially when there are better films of its genre out there. Goodfellas comes to mind, and I even found Casino more entertaining.

Basically, I like a film which leaves me thinking about it, and moved. This didn't really do either. Apparantly the sequel is better. I hope so."
1,Best Film Ever?,"No.1 Movie of all time? I think that's what ruined it for me, I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours.

Everything about it just lacked in moving me, the vengeance was untouched, parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched. Thoroughly this was the most disappointing film I've ever seen, not the worst, just the most disappointing. I'm not trying to change anyone's thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad - just in case anyone gets the impression.

Thanks"
10,Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made.,"Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.

However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able.

Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one.

The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end."
10,Film Perfection: Cinematic Mona Lisa,"So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of ""Deliverance"" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their ""labor""? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family."
10,The Greatest,"This is the greatest movie ever made. It not only gives an interesting view on the mafia, but it teaches many valuable lessons and ideas, for which a good example is in the first scene, the meeting between the Don and Bonasera (""What did I ever do to deserve such disrespect?""). I am 13 now, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. The Godfather has definitely made me smarter and prepared me for the independence of being a teenager. I would recommend if your child is 8+ and has not seen this movie that they watch it right away. I have the full box set, and have seen them all numerous times. The third was disappointing though, with dry acting, repetitive plot, and many awkward moments between Sofia Coppola and Al Pacino. I was also glad that the first two movies did not have too much violence, although there is a fair amount of Thompson guns in them. I have a habit of quoting Brando, who plays a character who delivers some of the most powerful, meaningful lines in any movie I have seen. I have seen most of Brando's movies, from Streetcar to Missouri breaks to the Freshman, in which his lines are so unique and unconventionally spoken they sometimes make me laugh. It was a true shame for Brando to die at the not-too-old age of 80, although he was not in good health at the time. Although many people are sure to claim the fame that Brando accomplished, I will always remember him to be the greatest actor ever."
10,"Stunnig, excellent, piece of art",This movie is one of thé best pièce of art in thé history of humanity
9,Masterpiece,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece. ""The Godfather"" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately ""The Godfather"" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime gen"
10,Powerful heart movie,"A young director (Coppola) took by paramount with no big experience and a young protagonist (Al Pacino) with no big experience too, together they realized the greatest movie never made! Taken by the Mario Puzo's book, the Godfather isn't a really mafia story but, overall, is a story of a family, of a man who live for make it stronger and more powerful who finished to ruin it with his same hands... A story of cruel moments and a story of heart's tears too... Now, thirty years later it still be the greatest motion picture never done, with a screenplay with no equals, a cast strong, powerful and good-acting and with a love inside that isn't scary of the present and the future of the cinema.... All the trilogy is great, (overall the second godfather), almost 9 hours of intense emotions! I'm proud to give it 10! And now you can find it in dvd version too, with a special edition very special: godfather (1 disc), godfather II (2 disc) and godfather III (1 disc) with a extraordinary special contents too... where you can find all -and I mean ALL- about this movie we'll never forget for the rest of our life and life that we will live in the future!"
10,One of those very few movies!,"""The Godfather"" - it is incredible what resonance this name has.I am from a poor country where cinematography has just started to become part of our lives and i've always heard of this movie but never until now got to see it.Before viewing it i checked up on it to see what i should expect from it and i was mesmerized by all the comments and the praise it gets.I said to myself i shouldn't get my hopes high because I most probably will be disappointed after i see it.So i acquired it and i started viewing...after 20 minutes i had the ""one of those movies"" feeling.I like to ""live"" every movie i watch and entering in the Corleone family was the most incredible cinematic experience i have ever had.It is one of those movies that you just can't get your mind off even after 2 weeks since you've seen it...you keep reminding the characters and the sets and everything and you blend in creating scenarios in your head and feel the drama.The music is superb and every time i hear it i get chills up my spine and begin day dreaming.I am afraid to watch it again because maybe i will get the impression it's not that great but it will happen soon i think and i will relive it though first time you watch it you get the most shocking experience you can get.This is one of the few movies that will always remain in my head and that my soul will hang on to in the desperate wish that I will actually live for real an experience like this ( my intellect knows it will never happen but you just can't control these strong feelings)."
10,WOW,"This is the classic gangster film, it has everything, love, violence, great acting, and a great cast and director. I think this will continue to be a classic for many years. It is such a brilliant film and i recommend that everybody that has the opportunity to, to watch it."
6,Are you kidding me?,"Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure"" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film."
1,The Yawn Father...,"If there was a zero out of 10, that's what I'd give it.

I know so many people hear the movie title, ""The Godfather"" and automatically feel like praising that movie, that whole trilogy, to the high heavens. Well, I don't care if it was made well...apart from how it was made, the movie was bad and I'm still upset that my philosophy teacher made me suffer through the whole trilogy. Boring...slow...just plain snooze-ville.

I'm probably going to have an angry mob coming after me for speaking of the movie this way, but it's my opinion...and I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling this way."
10,What a critic thinks,"As a film critic for one of the national newspapers, I often get asked the question ""what is the greatest film of all time"". For me, the answer comes naturally. ""The Godfather"". When everything is taken into account, from the acting, to the music score, it cannot be bettered. Those who contradict this cannot be as passionate about film as they think they are. Certainly there are other movies in the world, but take it from me, this is the finest piece of film-making you will ever see, it is a true epic. I will reveal nothing more, as I believe a film should be watched afresh, so that it has maximum impact. I would courteousely ask the person who wrote the page long essay on this site to restrict himself in future. Enjoy this film the very first time, enjoy it the second, indeed this is a movie that can be watched over and over, with the viewer discovering a new aspect each time. Enjoy the movie and revel in its greatness."
10,all movies should be made like this one,"Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to.

But a good movie is not only a good actor. The whole cast, the plot, the dialogs, the scenes and last but not least the director - Coppola are all near perfect. I thank GOD for bringing such talent to Hollywood as Brando and Coppola. Al Pacino is good but under Brando's brilliance his color did fade away a bit.

The supporting actor - Robert Duval is also a superb actor. Even in this cold and bloody killing movie he brings warmth of family friendship, loyalty and cool-headedness to the audience and making this movie this much more gripping.

The weight of a first-class movie is apparent starting from the first few scenes of the movie and lasted throughout the movie. Coppola knows how to grab audiences and move them up and down through the plot of the movie - a true master.

It is hard to compare Coppola with Lucas. They are both wonderful directors of different classes of movies. But I believe Coppola can better bring depth and intricate emotions to audience than Luca. This makes him a more memorable director even after we all pass on."
10,Awesome Movie,I really enjoyed this movie and I love everything with this movie!!
10,Even this movie's goofs were great,"We all know what a wonderful movie this is. I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film."
10,It is one of the top ten ever made!,"I was surprised looking at my voting history that I had not voted for this one before. Though not my number one it is one of the top ten ever made. The acting is outstanding. Young Pacino was at his very best. I don't want to start naming the actors, because all of them put in their best performance. Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented. The scene with the horse in the producers bed is gruesome, but the subjects are of that caliber. It is one of those movies that has to be seen at least once if for no other reason than because it truly is one of the best films ever made."
10,Quite possibly the greatest motion picture ever made,"The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a ""movie"" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen.

You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family.

The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.

To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another.

Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.

This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.

But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.

""I never listened to the big shots holding all the strings. But I hoped that someday you would be the one holding on the strings."""
10,The purest kind of epic,All my life I heard of this series known as the Godfather series. Do I really want to invest all this time? I heard each movie is three hours long. Do I really want to watch a bunch of shoot'em ups? About five years ago I broke down and watched the first one in the saga. I was completely dumbfounded and amazed with this masterpiece. Very few movies fall under the word masterpiece and this is definitely one of them. I gave this a 10.
1,Vastly overrated movie.....,"Finally took the time to give myself a real treat and watch this film again after about 20 years as I remembered it as a supremely good film. I have watched many movies from all over the world during the years and have developed a keen eye for good film making, so wanted to review one of the ""greats"".

After having watched it again, I have no choice but to face the fact that this film is indeed very poor film making and I have to admit that I feel embarrassed that I once actually considered this a good film!

The biggest gripe I have with this film is the unbelievably poor and unconvincing acting, devoid of any emotional depth whatsoever. Everybody is sterile and no-one is worth caring even the least bit about.

Secondly, almost every opportunity for character dynamics and development is missed. The only character that is developed is Michael Corleone's and even that character is changing from one extreme to the other, in an instant, with no transition whatsoever. The result is characters as mere moronic caricatures to the point of absurdity. A staggering waste of talent.

To top it off, the storyline is thin and highly predictable, simply an unforgivable waste of potential.

The organized crime genre of films have always fascinated me and continue to do so. With so many truly great films in this genre, don't waste your time on this one. The Godfather is one of the very worst."
10,review,"Timeless! A masterpiece of cinematography, that encompasses almost all branches of human sentiment in real life situations."
10,The best for all time.,"with no doubt,the greatest movie of all time.loyalty,family relations,business,power,authority or enmity are all in the movie,but while wathcing they are all invisible,when it ends,you can feel them strongly. No producer can shot something better than it.It is an offer that human-being cannot refuse."
9,Glory Glory Godfather!,"Masterpiece in true sense..

Right people! coming together for the, Right script ! at the, Right Time!

Coppola nailed it in every aspect. Yes the movie is long but packs in itself a plethora of epic performances.

The main role was tailored-made for Marlon Brandon.

What this movie is and will always be is far Micheal.. a star that was bone from this movie.

Al Pacino's character Michael is immortal and sets the screen on fire whenever is walks into the frame.

If you love cinema, watch it.. watch it again and again and again..

Glory Glory Godfather!"
8,Underwhelming,This movie is so hyped up and i say this before watching part 2 it was incredibly dull. I felt very little emotion towards any character and overall i think it was a slow start and was not interesting until the last hour or so. Still a good movie but wouldnt watch again.
10,"A sprawling, epic, Mafia masterpiece","This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.

To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed. The cast is great with Marlon Brando impressing in his oft imitated performance as Don Vito and Al Pacino doing a really fine job as Michael, a character who changes believably as events affect him. The rest of the cast, which includes James Caan, Robert Duvall. Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton are also great. Director Francis Ford Coppola does a great job bringing the story to the screen, helped by a fine soundtrack from Nino Rota. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fill fans."
10,Smells like Sicily,"This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it's the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it's not a movie made by a ""true"" Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of ""my"" arid land. It's not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone's speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA"
9,"Good, but maybe a bit overrated","In my personal opinion the godfather is an amazing movie that everyone should at least once as this is a timeless classic. The godfather has a lot of good elements and storytelling that is a very good watch. My one problem with the movie is how it is rated among the community. The godfather is commonly seen among the community as the greatest movie of all time, which in my opinion is not true. Although the godfather is a movie that everyone and there grandma has watched and enjoyed, including myself I don't think it should be marked down in history as the greatest movie of all time. Even movie that have come out i the past year have been on the same level, for example oppenheimer was a really good movie that was on the same level as the godfather."
10,The best film made !,"The godfather Must be the best film ever made? The story is so good and the filming by Coppola outstanding There are also so many smal details in this trilogy that are used in other films as a refferens. and the preformans of Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen)is exelent..

You can se the same exelent filming in ""Apocalypse now"" in these two films you can see some of the genius that makes Coppola films so great!

The Godfather nr:1 Apocalypse now nr:2"
7,a strange choice for best movie (but sure beats LOTR),"Hollywood has some strange politics. Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops. Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves. And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow). Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.

All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to ""The Godfather"" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs. I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power. I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of ""bestest picture ever.""

I actually think ""The Godfather: Part II"" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the ""human"" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here. And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with ""Star Wars,"" mistakenly remembering Yoda and ""Luke, I am your father"" as elements from the ""classic"" first film). Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.

I prefer ""Donnie Brasco"" because the character development is richer, and even ""A Bronx Tale"" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world). But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day."
1,a bunch of Italians mumble to each other while dealing with daddy issues,"forced to sit through this шit so many times by idiots extolling its virtues. i wish it was never made. I'm sick of mafia films and this dross started it all, moody, violent, miserable, and as intelligent as football and drinking. too many idiots today actually believe they are mafia because they sell some pot, or bought a dog that they beat until it turned nasty. grow up and bin this film. wooden acting throughout this title has set the bar for gangster films, and of course gangsters are not known for flair or intelligence when a beating or a bullet appears to cure all ills. the film is not a pleasure to watch, nor could i be less interested in the story of this mediocre family squabble. OK so this is my least favourite genre but it set that level. i urge anyone who hates this film to review it here and bring it down in the rankings to a reasonable 1-3 because the 10/10 that thousands of morons gave this is unreal."
10,Amazing,"One of the most successful movies ever made in Hollywood. Inspired me to study acting since I was 19 years of age so hard and become an actor in my country, Colombia. Spectacular work of acting in actors like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Michael Kane, Marlon Brandon and the whole cast. The crew had to be amazing to, in order to make such successful film. Bringing a tragic story from reality to the magic world of the movies, so many people can enjoy it. Today seems the time has not past and it is very pleasant to enjoy amazing acting performances of each actor and still learn from each peace of scene. It will never past away and will stay as a classic, hope it can be around for all new generations of actors, directors and producers. Wish some day I can share tables and set with great actors like them, who have been inspiring and example in my work and professional life as an actor. Thank you all."
10,Incredible...,"What a truly special movie this is. Despite its violence, heavy content, and length, I could literally watch it every week. This film contains some of the most tragic, well-devoloped characters in the history of American cinema; they are simply unforgettable. Then there are the masterful performances, the beautiful cinematography and art direction, the wonderful script, etc., etc. In short, this is one of the most perfect stretches of celluloid ever."
10,The Greatest Movie Ever Made.,"The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own. But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone. The Godfather is filled with a great storyline, beautiful acting, and a gruesome showing of the crime family."
10,Best gangsters movie ever.,"This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the ""godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's ""five families"". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an ""offer we cannot refuse"": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.

If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century. Those who love good cinema must see this film."
10,A divine masterpiece of acting and directing...,"When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let's be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather. Whether you like gangster-movies or not, this is one you can't miss!!!"
10,a movie beyond judgement,"Let me start not with high praise, which is a regular sentence spoken on this movie. It is a motion-picture to discuss and yes there are elements in it that are extremely ambivalent. In the context of acting, directing and all the other formal aspects this is an exceptional achievement. I cannot think of too many others that can claim to have as polished dialogue and yet believable actors. But nevertheless the aspect of presenting a family-tragedy within a mafia-clan is at least to be consumed with your mind switched on. Coppola doesn't bother to present obvious critical points of view, but he presents the members of the Corleone-Clan as business-men. They react on their surroundings in the way it is necessary and to protect their family they don't bother to kill dozens of people. It is the contrast between the loving father and cold-blooded head of the clan, which attracts so many people to Brando's performance. He is so life-like on the one hand and yet manages to mute the questionable traits of character that would paint Don Vito as a criminal. On the whole it can be said that this is still a movie which should polarize audiences, not least due to the growing influence of mafia like structures in many poor countries."
7,"Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...","Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.

But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.

I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.

Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.

Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.

A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s."
3,Disappointing,"After all the hype people have given this movie and the fact it won Best Picture confuses me.

Most of it was just people sitting around talking. There were some good actiony scenes but they are few and far between, aside from Sonny's sister flipping her lid and smashing up the house, followed by the famous tollbooth scene a few minutes later.

Speaking of the house-smashing scene, it's meant to be dramatic but I burst out laughing, but that's just my morbid sense of humor.

Maybe I'm just not ""getting it"" and my head is up where the sun doesn't shine, but this movie was just...... kinda boring for me."
9,A tale of personal business,"Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon."
10,Simply a masterpiece,"I guess we have all seen the movie, but at the moment I am writing an essay about it, and therefore seeing it over and over, and I must say, it is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.... However, Godfather part II is close.... See it, and you want to be a gangster"
9,Unrefusable,"Akin to the world's finest wines, ""The Godfather"" deepens in vitality with each passing year in cinema."
10,A study in social pathology,"A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star."
10,MASTERPIECE - Best Movie of All Time,"The Godfather is the best movie of all time because this movie got the most splendid crew. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo, the author of the book ""The Godfather"" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of movies, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Pacino's raspy pseudo- whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."
9,"A Good Movie, Even For This CGI'd Up Generation","I am 15 at the time of writing this review, and all the movies I have watched made before 1980 I didn't enjoy. It probably wasn't the films' fault; it's just I'm used to movies with realistic CGI effects, HD quality and current actors, but nonetheless I often found the films' quality too grainy to bear and the effects too cheap to appreciate. It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather.

First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn't recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot.

In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies. It's the best start to a trilogy that I've ever seen!"
10,Almost a perfect story of the Sicilian family crime syndicate in the early 20th Century in America,"The movie is based on Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and tells a story of an organized crime family that has moved to America to create a fortune and gather the ultimate respect of the surrounding world.

Francis Ford Coppola has directed a masterpiece that lives in its own time and can easily be watched as many times as possible without losing its touch. The movie is quite long and has couple of scenes that are at the same time very violent and very beautiful. Cruel murders are committed and the beautiful music that is played in the background creates an enormous mix of color and sound that has very powerful affect on the viewer who will follow the storyline dazed and amazed. The classic horse head scene, the wedding, murder of NY Police Captain, watching a young war hero to become a ruler of cruel gangster syndicate is just must see scenes"
10,A deep and thought provoking film,"I must admit it wasn't until the second time I saw this film I realised just how flawless it really is.

However, what really struck me the second time was just how psychologically deep the movie really is, particularly in respect to the number of symbolic moments used throughout.

For instance, note the turning points in the film following Michaels visit to the hospital. Whilst standing vigil with a nervous (!) friend of his fathers on the hospital steps he lights the other man's cigarette. He seems to be taken back either by just how relaxed HE is or possibly something more deeper comparing the opening/closing of the lighter to the motion made by the trigger of a gun.

Also note a moment shortly after this, following a punch he receives from a corrupt policeman, leaving him with a swollen jaw. Michael Corleone sits amongst family and friends plotting the murder of two threats to the family business. He is calm and calculated in his plotting, and even physically resembles his father (swollen jawed).

How many other levels does this film go?"
10,"The Classic,Iconic movie ever!","It was slow burn the way every scene played it was amazing to look it's too slow yet engaging to look the meetings background were skeptical.the Music and the use of it is phenomenal whenever something is happening the music was way too calm and terrifying at same time!the story was amazing the family of gangster and the society of gangsters and there feuds!the acting was iconic especially by marlon and al and everyone was amazing as there characters!screenplay was good at start it was slow and boring at the wedding as it was just intro to what is next then when the horse scene up from then it was entertaining and calm to watch,the ending was satisfyingly amazing the way mike turned gangster was iconic and at last the look on the face and music while talking to wife was the signal that he's no more mike he's The Godfather now!overall A Classic Gangster Masterpiece the theme is dark and calm at same time.Iconic movie!"
10,"One of the greatest film ever, not just a good film but inspired follow up classics",It is very difficult to talk about this film as a film. It is the beginning of in institution of gangSTAR films. Scarface has it going on but this is beautiful artisty combining actors that were Oscar winners and actors who went on to win Oscars! Al Pachino was incredible in depiction of a dark Amrerican come Sicillian... Marlon Brando was inspiring and I think made it very hard for Bob DeNero to measure up to. James Caan was very good and even the support characters were so well written and acted out it was brilliant! Along with this the music was also very good with the mix of Italian and American Swing. I loved it!
10,Still a masterpiece!,"It's true, this is still a masterpiece! But you didn't need me to tell you that."
10,A masterpiece,"At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando's unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.

Coppola's direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the ""Prince of Darkness,"" enhances the film's iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota's haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.

A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history."
9,Amazing,This is one of my favorite movie. The videography was amazing. Styling and costumes were on point. Overall beautiful.
10,The best hands down,"This masterpiece is never get bored watching it. Best move every time i see it i learn something.

All parts of this movie is great but the first is my favorite.

Every month. I see it once, my kids knows the characters . I wish the remake it or at least a tv show.

In all this years since 1972 many movies was made but I think godfather still the best for all viewers here in USA and internationally.

First time I watched it was with my grandfather. I really thought it was boring long speeches and next time was when i got over 20 years and started to understand it. I wish everyone watch it again with patience and it's ok i you watched 1 hour every day for the first time.

Strongly recommend and never forgotten.

Thanks for all the crew and mr. Coppola you knows you made millions happy."
10,It is amazing,"This movie is my favourite movie ever it is the best especially marlon brando and al pacino these actors are amazing 👏 👌I really like the start and the ending I the story itself is amazing I am really speechless no body can make a movie like this it those great actors it really deserves number one.

7,great movie we like it,"Hi i'm rosette , thank you for connecting with us and it's help us best serve you and others, Can you take 1 minute to leave a review about your opinion with us? Thanks for your support!"""
1,what is the big deal?,"I'm glad there are a few voices of dissent within all of the gushing

hype listed here. Do the fans of this movie rate ""Citizen Kane"" as

the 2nd best film of all time? Then maybe listen to the Beatles and

Elvis Presley as the greatest music of all time? Is America under

some kind of cultural mass-hypnosis?

Grossly overrated on all counts."
10,Flashy glamour of the traditional gangs.,"It absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel."
10,Undoubtedly the best,"A note about the poor reviews- Reading through the lower one and two star ratings I was shocked to see how many people are incapable of understanding the true masterpiece of a film that this is. The fact that people think this is unrealistic shows that they know nothing of this time period of mafia. They think of Al Capone and the violence that is related to him, and assume this is the only type of person in the mafia. You need to understand that the mafia wasn't just guns, money, and murder. It was a business, yes illegal, but a business. It had class. People who say this movie didn't have plot shock me. It tells me they were either not paying attention or just too simple minded to understand it.

On a note about the movie- It was an excellent portrayal of the mafia during this time. Everything about this movie was perfect. The acting was so believable it's hard to see these actors in other films. The culture of Italian American and Italian is touching and realistic. The show of family, emotions, and the complexities of the underworld are superior to any other film, specifically other mafia movies. I enjoy Goodfellas and Scarface but they just don't compare. We must remember that they are set in different time periods so they are all realistic but very different, for this reason you cannot say the Godfather isn't realistic because it isn't similar to Goodfellas. I prefer the class and composure of the older setting in Godfather. Truly an amazing film. Undoubtedly the best."
9,The Godfather,"The movie ""The Godfather"" is an awesome movie! Some things that inspired me to watch the whole series was: tension, characters, and the love. All of these thing brought the movie to life. It was the most dramatic thing ever; however it was sad.

When Michael says ""Ah, that little farce you played with my sister. You think that would fool a Corleone?"" The director did the lines terrifically well. This line capturing to me. This would be the most exciting movie that I've ever seen! I'm so glad my family recommended it to me. At first I thought that the movie would be horrible, but then I realized that the tension was to much that I had to keep watching it. It was the kind of movie that when it ended you wanted to see the next one just to know what would happen. A few times I cried, but don't all movies have a crying point in them. It was just to much action, tension, and feeling in the movie for me to stop watching.

The character Al Pancio was my favorite because he has so much energy in his role plays. Some other movies that he played in was: ""ScarFace"", ""Heat"", and of course ""The Godfather"". All of these were his best yet. Al Pancio is the most vibrant actor that I have ever seen, that would probably be why I love his acting so much. Furthermore, another actor would be Richard S. Castellano. Additionally, this man was the one who taught Al Pancio how to shoot the crooked cop in the movie, and the shocking thing was that he used to be a construction manager. One woman, named Talia Shire, also played a role. She has stared not only in ""The Godfather"", but in ""Rocky"". She is also the stepmother of the Schwartzman family. All these actors/actress were magnificent during the movie, they played their part so well.

The sad thing about the movie would be the death. Moreover, the death was gruesome. It had so much detail that you can't seem to watch; however, you sometimes just can't turn away. Although if given a chance it will come to the point that it's awesome. This stage point of the death will soon rube off in less you hate the fact of blood (lots of blood and cursing). All I'm saying is give it a chance.

The love that the character give to each other is so affectionate, even off scene there still friends. It's like as though there one big family meeting for a family reunion. Even in the movie they gradually connect. For example, Al Panico and Richard S. Castellano. They were like father and son when they were together, and in the movie they were still like family except at the same time enemies. The movie, when seen, will have the same effect on you once you notice how well they act together. The film went on for $80,000 because Paramount bought in before the book became a best-seller. A previous gangster film bombed at the box office, the company was reluctant to even make the movie, and initially budgeted only $2 million to $3 million. That's a fact.

Over all, the movie is great to watch. Its tension will follow you until you've seen the whole series. ""The Godfather"" is one of the most never before seen movies with life in it. With what the movie has you will not no what was just watched. The movie is epic and will always be remembered as the most amazing movie ever."
10,Best Recommended,Can't stop watching and playing this best action scene on my PS3.
10,An Excellent Movie,"Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States ""Don Vito Corleone"" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter ""Connie Corleone"" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son ""Michael Corleone"" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers ""Sonny Corleone"" (James Caan), ""Fredo Corleone"" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother ""Tom Hagen"" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort."
10,"Classic, never gets old vision","Godfather is a groundbreaking and truly original piece of legendary film. With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment. Life like acting with emotive vibrations, grips you from the offset, with a compelling story that seems to get more intense and exciting as the film rolls on. This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic.

Peace and Blessings"
8,THE FILM,Best film ever ive never seen. All of them are incredible. must watch
3,Boring,Overrated movie. not even in my top 1000 movie. I feelt so sleeping while watchin it and felt that I just wasted two hours watching it and decided to stop
10,God father? I mean geod father!,I said geod father how funny I'm? But let's be honest amazing job

10,"The Godfather: A Timeless Masterpiece of Power, Loyalty, and Family","The Godfather is an iconic masterpiece that transcends the crime genre and stands as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, it delves into the intricate world of the Corleone family, balancing themes of power, loyalty, and family with a hauntingly elegant narrative.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, embodying a character that is both ruthless and deeply principled. Al Pacino, in his breakout role as Michael Corleone, showcases a complex transformation from an innocent war hero to a cold-blooded mafia boss. The supporting cast, including James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, add depth to the story with compelling performances.

Coppola's direction is masterful, blending slow-burning tension with moments of shocking violence. The cinematography by Gordon Willis uses light and shadow to create a visual style that mirrors the film's moral ambiguity. The iconic score by Nino Rota further elevates the emotional depth of the film, becoming synonymous with the epic tale of the Corleone family.

What sets *The Godfather* apart is its ability to humanize its characters while exploring the dark world of organized crime. It's not just a film about the mafia; it's a study of power, tradition, and the corrupting influence of ambition. The film's influence on cinema is undeniable, and its themes remain relevant today.

*The Godfather* is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences with its compelling storytelling, unforgettable performances, and impeccable craftsmanship. A must-watch for any film enthusiast."
10,The best movie made ever,"This is the best film made ever.

To learn and to understand how to make good movies The Godfather is the best movie ever that nobody filmed until now except Coppola. A perfect cinematic scenes, locations, art designs, wardrobe, plot, role acting, direction, art department, script, etc. This film has all the ingredients to know how to make a brilliant good film. Unfortunately knowing all of these parts too many people adding structural parts of the movies and making with all these ingredients didn't make a movie as Francis Ford Coppola made."
10,CLASSIC,ALL TIME GREATS COME TOGETHER ON THIS ONE LOVE IT. I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN A MOVIE WE ALL GREAT ACTORS AROUND ME MAKING A CLASSIC FILM WIT THERE SPECIAL TALENTS IN IT WHY NOT .
9,Exceptional... !,"I heard a lot about this movie and very curious about this one and after watching the movie i think it is the most powerful and fulfilling ride one wants.

It starts off very well but these are the turns which make that a wonderful experience. Lots of happening make in interesting and more importantly engaging. I strongly feel that this movie is not for those who do not like the revenge or the other way around about not found of mind games and politics.

Now the hall mark is the acting of Brando which takes this to all time high. Alogn with this, Al Pacino did a well job. But music score of the movie needs a special mention. I still feel that the effect might not be that strong without such hammer strong music.

In the end... just like to say... watch it ... again and again and always you will find something very special."
10,Winner!,"The godfather is one of the greatest movies ever put together. Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it's time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives.

The costumes not only fit the time in which the movie was set for, but as each set ventured from one location to another they matched the costumes with the location and each scene appropriately. Additionally each character seemed to have their own sort of style they displayed through these costumes. If each character looked and sounded the same, a viewer could easily guess the character by the clothing they wore.

The plot engages the movie beautifully. From the beginning to end it leaves the viewer having a very direct and excellent understanding of what is happening and how it ties in to the main story. Even through watching the movie multiple times and knowing what happens I can still avoid anticipating what will happen next because it is so well established and drawn out.

Matching costumes, characters are captured in beautiful and well constructed sets. Viewers can actually watch the movie and though have never been to where the movie takes place, they are able to visualize and understand exactly where they are. This movie does an excellent job at not just focusing on where the action is but showing a larger portion of the picture to allow viewers to fill in any additional puzzle pieces that normally aren't formed but in some cases with some viewers is absolutely necessary to understand exactly where they are in each scene.

The sound track is very emotional. The symphony sound texture to the music allows background music to be applied to a scene and assist viewers to visualize what is going on and the emotions to be expected while the scene unfolds without requiring the use of additional vocals. This is exceptionally beneficial at the beginning and ending of each scene, as it displays the mood of the scene as it starts out or leaves a lasting effect of whatever just took place.

Last but not least the actors are the people who made the film what it was. Each role was very specific to the actor and very distinguished from one to another. In specific, the Don's sons Michael and Sonny, were extreme opposites. While one was very calm and easy going the other was very hot headed and gung hoe, looking for action and death to those who disagreed with him or stood up to the other family members.

All in all the movie was wonderful from beginning to end ultimately I would not change a single thing or think something could have been done to better the film. I definitely recommend anyone who has not watched this movie already to check it out!"
10,The best ever,This movie has everything a movie needs. No further explanation needed.
4,Why all the fuss,"Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?"
10,The Father of Cinema.,"The Godfather (1972)

Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Richard S. Castellano, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, John Marley. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

Spoilers herein.

I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. ""The Godfather"" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.

Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of ""Last Tango in Paris"". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of ""family"" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.

This film, it's sequel and ""Apocalypse Now"" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like ""Scarface (1983)"" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Untouchables"" and many others would have ever been made. ""The Godfather"" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5 stars out of 5."
10,Just a question!!,"I just need to confirm the name and location of the restaurant in which Michael shoots/kills Solozzo and McCluskey:

Is it Louie's Restaurant on Gunhill Road & White Plains Road in the Bronx????

I have been in debate about this information with a friend. During the shooting of this movie, I was a teenager and working in a supermarket right across the street on White Plains Road & Gunhill Road and had the pleasure of watching it all.

My friend claims that according to the book, it was on Arthur Avenue with a different name.

I know that I am correct but could you please send me back an email confirming this info.

Thank you, Mia Contardi 917-4327-5430"
10,Tour de force,"Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by ""Goodfellas"", Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid. Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society. While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, ""The Godfather"" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law. It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself.

Coppola had made seven unsuccessful films before he contacted author Mario Puzo, whose novel about a fictional Sicilian  American family of crime had become a best seller. Urged on by his heritage and commitment to creating a film that would match his huge ego, Coppola sat down with Puzo (when he could pull him away from the Black Jack tables of Las Vegas and Reno) and re-wrote the story. The result was a screenplay of supreme quality, eschewing the soap opera, meandering work of Puzo's novel for a tight, taut and fluid narrative.

The legacy behind Coppola's involvement on the film belies belief when we consider how well the film turns out. Paramount, by all accounts, despised Coppola. Through the entire film's shooting a standby director was waiting to take over as Coppola's head was constantly on the chopping board. It was at Coppola's insistence that Marlon Brando, who had not made a decent film for a good decade, be cast as Don Vito Corleone. Paramount wanted Frank Sinatra. Coppola also had to convince the studio that a young Al Pacino, 26 at the time, should play Michael Corleone, the aire to Vito. Studio executives thought Pacino lacked depth and was too small and scrawny to play the part. James Caan, who eventually played Sonny, was pencilled in early as Michael. Things could have been so different.

The story is based around the final years of the reign of Vito Corleone (Brando), a Sicilian immigrant who had formed a powerful empire of crime in New York. Now a man with powerful connections in the political and legal systems, Corleone is almost untouchable. His family consists of three sons; tough, aggressive eldest son Sonny (James Caan); weak, feeble but good-natured Fredo (John Cazale) and smart, quiet and distant Michael (Pacino). He also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who also acts as the family's legal advisor  the Consilari. The youngest child is daughter Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is next in line to take over the family business when Vito's time draws to a close, but his aggressive nature could be his undoing. When Vito denies capital assistance to Virgil The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) for heroin trafficking, things take a downward turn. Michael assumes the role of Don and in the process the cracks in the family empire begin to appear. We witness the painfully slow collapse of the Corleone empire, as Michael's friends turn into enemies and the honour and code (Omerta) of the past becomes virtually non-existent.

Brando was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor as Vito and it is well deserved. He is utterly convincing and memorable, despite the numerous parodies on the character. But it is Pacino who shines as the ever-insular Michael. Starting out as idealistic war hero and ending the first film as power corrupted mafia boss, Pacino's portrayal of the youngest Corleone shifts seamlessly along. Pacino is at his best when his character is faced with a personal dilemma, not one associated with business'.

Of course the entire cast is brilliant. James Caan commands the first third of the film as Sonny. He is pure aggression, an old school tough guy who acts first and thinks later. Robert Duvall is solid as Hagen and is at his best in the early scenes involving studio hotshot Jack Woltz (John Morley). Diane Keaton is excellent as Kaye Adams, the WASP whose life is changed forever when she agrees to marry Michael. In the limited screentime allocated to her character Keaton gives it her all and is a far cry from the characters she became associated with in her Woody Allen films. Other actors of note include Richard Castellano as Capo Regime Peter Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio, Richard Conte as Don Barzini and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop Captain McKluskey. Even the minor characters in the film are memorable.

The production design by Dean Tavoularis is exquisite. The Don's den is brilliantly lit, or more so unlit. It consumes its inhabitants in the shadows, and the Don himself moves with stealth around his cavernous headquarters. Complementing the design is the brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis. The film is shot with a soft yellow filter, giving it an aged feel. When the film relocates to Sicily, Willis opens up the screen and fills it with breathtaking surroundings and the quaint, quiet environment of the tiny villages where the saga all began. Then when the film returns to the United States and Michael begins his ascendancy to the upper-echelons of power, Willis turns down the colour and presents Michael as an almost dead character, stripped of life and feeling. It's a great touch and is best emphasised when Michael woos Kaye, albeit without an inkling of charm, back into his life. He gestures Kaye towards the car, which resembles a Hearse more than a limo and her life in his downward spiral begins.

""The Godfather"" smashed all box office records before it and spawned the blockbuster': one film from one studio that would be able to crush any of its opponents. The film took home three Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (rejected by Brando) and Screenplay from Previously Published material. With Coppola now on top and Paramount in his corner the stage was set for the next chapter in the saga. But that's another story altogether"
10,My Favourite Film Of All Time 10/10,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told."
10,One of the best,"One of the best movies i have ever seen

The theme is very gangster. most movies this year dont even match up"
8,An offer I could refuse,"To my opinion, the most overrated film of all times.

An overrated story of an overrated person (America's infamous home grown terrorist), played by an overrated actor - Marlon Brando, which has almost nothing left from the juicy stud that made your lips wet in ""A streetcar called desire"".

Rather than being a fine adaption of an anyway colorful book, and a playground for an impressive group of talents, the movie has not much else to offer. No one of the actors is at his/her best.

Technically, Coppola is a genious. The best 2 dimension director. But his films always lack the 3'rd dimension. You're coming out great, Frank, but what exactly are you trying to say?"
7,But how?,"This movie was just a movie. I have a definitely sure thing as this movie just doesn't deserve this score. I'm ok with sayings like ""Omg how you say this, it's the godfather"" so what? What makes the Godfather a Godfather. Couldn't have gotten this score just for acting and editing so ? It was very very nice but it was just a New York gangs story and it was like eh. What made you feel like giving this movie a 10. What? I'm begging you to make me feel like this. I watched this movie after seeing this score and it take my 3 hours. I'm happy for satisfying my curiosity but not for movie. The Shawshank Redemption or Seven or another movies were way better. I still don't know what was the point of the movie and why it have a score like 9,2. It is clearly 7,8-8,4 and just take it away from the list top 3. I don't want to watch 2 and 3 but o have to anymore. I'm sorry."
1,Lost For Words...,"I honestly don't know what to say ... This has got to be the worst movie i've ever had the misfortune to watch and yet it's getting such good reviews. Why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me. Is almost everyone on IMDb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this? I found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it! My advice to anyone thinking of watching this - don't, it will only disappoint you. There is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging. Characters and events are boring to follow and personally I feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given."
10,"One of the greatest films ever, a masterpiece","This movie deserves either pages of analytics and insight or else the simplest of all reviews, and I opt for the latter. One of the greatest films I've ever seen, a masterpiece of direction, acting, music, cinematography, sets and costumes and of course a monumentally good story."
10,Masterpiece,"The Godfather is a cinematic titan that redefines the gangster genre.

With iconic performances, a haunting score, and a meticulously crafted narrative, the film offers a gripping exploration of the American Dream gone dark. A true cinematic landmark that continues to captivate audiences decades later. Great movie indeed. The Godfather is a cinematic titan that redefines the gangster genre.

10,Classic Cinema,"Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of ""familia""...no wonder it stands the test of time. The performers were at the top of their games in this one. Maybe they should make a modern- day follow up. I mean, they are remaking everything else. Why not? Need a writer? Let me know! :)"
9,A reading of The Godfather from Machiavelli's point of view:,"The Godfather is a movie that shows many ideas from the Italian philosopher Machiavelli, especially from his book The Prince.

Machiavelli believed that a good leader must be smart, strong, and ready to do things that are not always good or moral. He said it is better for a leader to be feared than loved, because fear helps keep power. He also advocated that the goal is more important than the way how you reach it. ""Il fine giustifica i mezzi"".

Vito Corleone is a perfect example of a Machiavellian leader. He is calm, wise, and patient. He helps people and keeps strong family values, but he also uses fear and violence when necessary. People respect him because he knows when to be kind and when to be firm. He always tries to keep peace and order, but he never forgets the importance of power.

His heir, Michael, is different. At first, he doesn't want to join the family business. But after his father got almost murdered, he slowly changes. He becomes a cold and distant leader. Michael uses violence and fear much more than his father did. He becomes powerful, but he loses the love and trust of the people around him even his family (as you can see in the second chapter).

Through both characters, The Godfather shows Machiavelli's ideas in action. It teaches us that power often comes with hard choices, and that a leader must sometimes do bad things to protect his position. But the movie also shows the cost of this way of thinking. Michael becomes successful, but also lonely and full of regret.

The movie is not just a crime story. It is a deep dive into power, leadership, and the difficult choices that come with them."
10,great great and great!!!!,This is the best movie that i ever seen!!! awesome acting by Al Pacino and Marlon Berando great great and great!!!!!!!!!
10,THE mafia film of all time,"This movie is simply the best gangster movie of all time and one of the greatest movies in cinema history from the very beginning every character is believable, every speech sounds authentic and every scene draws you deeper and deeper into the story.

The big name stars in this movie put in incredible performances. If you like movies put his on your must see list, if you like mobster movies buy it now."
7,"Good, Maybe Great, Not The Best Movie Ever","Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II."
5,MOB FLICK NOT AS GOOD AS EVERYONE THINKS,"I would like to tell everyone that this movie is highly overated expecially considering it is the number one movie in the IMDB TOP 250 LIST!! Dont get me wrong i like like Francis Ford Coppola's movies but i have never been a fan of this series!! He definatly has an all star line up , but come on people Marlon Brando cannot act his way out of a paper bag!! Just like one of my favorite Coppola movies ""Apocalypse Now"" Marlon got top billing over Martin Sheen when right well Martin should have been the oscar nominee!! It is a good trilogy but let me tell you something? If you want a good down to earth mob movie see anything done by Martin Scorsese! I wasnt really over touched by this series but i know it has alot of fans!! See ya folks!!!"
10,These are movies,I grew up with films like this where the directors tried to show even though it's a man in crime that compromises can be made. Today's movies are terrifying.
10,A MASTERPIECE !!,"When I first watched ""The Godfather"" and I was blowned away! This movie is something else. The way it pulls you into the world of the Corleone family is incredible. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone? Absolutely legendary. And Al Pacino's transformation throughout the film? Mind-blowing. The story is so rich and complex, but it never loses you. It's like you're right there, part of this dangerous, fascinating world. The scenes, the music, the tension - it all comes together perfectly. I found myself holding my breath during some parts! It's not just a gangster movie; it's about family, power, and tough choices. I can see why everyone calls it a masterpiece. Honestly, I'm still thinking about it days later. If you haven't seen it, you're seriously missing out. It's long, but trust me, it's worth every minute. This is definitely going on my list of all-time favorites!"
8,"Very god movie but to me, not worth a 9 or 10","Very good movie, no doubt!

However, I suspect a nostalgy bonus in the ratings.

Despite a 70s movie, you will find a very modern way of story telling, scripting, image recording and actor skills.

You won't feel as being watching an « old » movie.

Actions are held realistic, there is no exaggeration, which makes everything credible.

But honestly, there are many modern movies that get worse ratings but that are not less enjoyable."
10,Story Or Poem,"In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.

Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca ""sleeps with the fishes"". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.

Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gunfire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.

Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a ""wartime consigliere""; Vito agrees Tom should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.

In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, Peter Clemenza, garrotes Carlo with a wire. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her."
10,Near Perfect,"Not a lot can be said about this classic that hasn't already been written in hundreds of reviews on this website and across the world in the decades since its release. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall are all amazing here. The script and the pacing are perfect. It's really a great story about the shedding of ideals in favor of supporting the corrupt criminal gang that is Michael Corleone's (Pacino) family. So many classic quotes and movie scenes. This is one of the all time greats."
10,Classic movie you can't miss!,"When people are asked what the greatest movie ever made is, many people say Citizen Kane(I being one) but others will say The Godfather. I would not rank it that high, but I do think it is great. (I think the 2nd film is better, actually). It runs long at nearly 3 hours but it is very worth it! It's just such an iconic look at the Mafia. If you have never seen The Godfather and are offered a chance, take it. It's an offer you can't refuse."
10,The epic gangster film.,"This film is a must see for any movie fan,a true masterpiece of the American cinema"
10,A True classic!,This is a must see film for anyone at least once in your lifetime. A true masterpiece that was brilliantly written with an All Star cast!
7,Its fine,"I was interested in one of the most highly reviewed movies of all time and I was not super disappointed but also not super impressed.

Most of the characters are good even though I think there are way too many and the movie should have focused on fewer but more extensively. The acting of the main characters was great but there were many performances on the side which almost made me laugh (at scenes which should not be funny). The cinematography is good. Overall I would say it is a fine movie but I will probably not watch it again soon. Though I liked the ending which pulled all of the stories together.

I feel like many people only remember: I'll make him an offer he can't refuse; and think it is the most iconic thing in a movie that ever happened."
2,Overrated,"If you aren't a thug lover... if you don't drool over less than smart bad guys somehow getting ahead... if you don't really like spectacle just for spectacle sake... then this movie may not be for you. To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.

Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.

So sorry, this movie just isn't great."
10,My Favourite Movie,I love Al Pacino Movie. The Godfather is the world's greatest movie and Marlon Brando was great actor I love his acting and Soundtrack is so great and beautiful.
10,A timeless masterpiece of cinematic storytelling: The Godfather.,"The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as a classic film. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, the movie tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan in New York City.

The movie is known for its stunning cinematography, excellent script, and memorable performances by a star-studded cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan. Brando, in particular, shines in his role as the patriarch of the Corleone family, delivering an iconic performance that earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.

The movie is a thrilling and suspenseful exploration of the dynamics of organized crime, as the Corleones navigate rivalries, alliances, and betrayals. The characters are complex and well-developed, with motives and personalities that are both compelling and believable.

""The Godfather"" is a masterclass in filmmaking, with a score that is just as memorable as its cinematography. It's a movie that demands repeat viewings, as each time you watch it, you'll discover new details and nuances that deepen your understanding and appreciation of the story.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a must-see for anyone who loves film, storytelling, or just a great crime drama."

You have an amazing storyline that contains stellar writing, some of the best acting out there, a beautiful score, etc.. There are genuinely 0 flaws with this movie. It is a stunning piece of cinema that every film lover needs to watch at least once."
10,One of the best films of all time,"To put it short, ""The Godfather"" is a timeless masterpiece. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get to. It has an amazing script which is directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The cast is Hollywood royalty from top to bottom and everyone plays their part to perfection. Of course, the stars of the film are Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. Both of the actors give career defining performances portraying arguably two of the most famous characters to be ever put on film. The film is filled to the brim with unforgettable scenes and quotes all of which work seamlessly together in crafting a highly re-watchable masterpiece of cinema that will equally satisfy the casual moviegoer as well as the most harden film critics."

10,World's Greatest Film that's always The Godfather,"The Godfather (1972) was voted number 1 by Entertainment Weekly's readers in 1999 and voted as number 1 in a Time Out readers' poll in 1998. The film was voted the ""Greatest Movie of All Time"" in September 2008 by 10,000 readers of Empire magazine, 150 people from the movie business, and 50 film critics."
1,"One of History's Most Overrated Movies, Which Is Actually a Soap Opera","Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don't wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss."
10,"I believe in ""The Godfather""","A cinematic masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola. One of the greatest movies ever made. Marlon Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: realistic anti-hero, villain with million of verges. It's also story about how one good man (war hero) become a genius of a criminal world. Every scene was directed with the soul. Combined with Part II. In this movie perfect everything: perfect characters, adapted screenplay, and original soundtrack. Film about relationship between family members, loyalty, honor in life of gangsters and revenge. The Godfather did for gangster movies what Alfred Hitchcock did for Thriller (Suspense) genre."

10,Masterpiece,"If you haven't watched it yet, go and watch it now."
1,Awful film,"The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.

Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast."
10,A masterpiece everyone should watch,"A masterpiece everyone should watch. One of the best film ever made and surely my top film of my personal 100 most loved films. It shows the reality around us, the presence of evil and the presence of good inside evil. Everyone has good inside himself, even the most ruthless criminal."
10,The story of the Corleones: Chapter One,"Before I saw 'The Godfather', I had always wondered about it; been seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie.

A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations).

Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.

This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.

Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time.

First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).

The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.

The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more ""beautiful""!

The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion!

The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!)

Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being ""hit by thunderbolt"" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.

The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse....."
8,Excellent,The best movie I've have ever seen. Want to more movies like these.
10,One of the truly great films ever made,"the Godfather is one of the best films you will ever see. This is an entralling tail of an aging mobster who must choose from his sons a successor to his position. Having only recently seen the film for the first time, and then reading Mario Puzo book, you see how well most characters were transferred to the screen. Sonny, Michael, Freddy, Clemenza, Tom, Tessio, Johnny and Kay to name but a few were all well acted and true to the book (Though Johnny Fontaine's part was cut down severely). The only exceptions were the Don himself (Pure Marlon Brando, De Niro did a much better job of playing Vito Corleone in Godfather II) and Luca Brasi, who was hardly the scary underground hitman of the book.

This film is a must see."
10,Fantastic!,One of the best movie of all time! Everyone should watch this movie.
10,One of the best masterpiece in movie history,"It feels more like a documentary than a movie, a documentary on family history. This movie super-passed the original novel, it reminds me of Márquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude""."
7,Underworld Drama,"A pretty good underworlds drama... Presenting us with a very good picture of the inside world of the Italian mafia and their activities in Italy (Sicily) and the USA (New York and various other places).

One on the best castings I have seen, great cast and crew.

The cinematography is also great, an outstanding job from the creators.

The script is very well redacted glamourising crime and also keeping family traditions as part of their codes and with the help of the actors it comes alive beautifully.

Coppola's greatest directing movies, a must seen movie, actually a saga of movies to enjoy for filmmakers and movie followers."
1,Not what I expected,"After hearing about this legendary film I decided it was about time I watched it....after about an hour I really wished I hadn't wasted the money renting it...after the movie finished I was bored. The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has. It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie. You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era. I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point! I think I'll go watch Marlon Brando's greatest performance...Guy's N Doll's."
9,A truly story driven plot line,"This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.

There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making."
10,Why I watched this movie,Because of the title of this movies I watched this movie.
10,best movie in history,The best movie in the history of cinema There really is no more unique than this movie in my opinion I have little to say I still enjoy watching this movie and learning something from it.
10,Top 5 All Time,"This one is the classic family movie. They just happen to be murderers and gangsters and businessmen. This is the movie that taught all non-gangsters how that world really is and what it is like to be involved with the family. Some of the best crew was put together, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton to name a few and it was all brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola."
10,Text,"This is the textbook of how to do gangster movies. There are more than 1000 movies am sure inspired by this movie world over by this epic. Acting, Cinematography, Makeup, Action name any department and this movie excels. Have watched it for more than 100 times yet it never fails to amuse me."
10,#651: An Epic to Rival All Epics.....But Read the Book!!,"To speak of The Godfather is like speaking about the Holy Grail of films. At more than fifty years since it's inception, Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a triumph and cornerstone of the movie industry that all filmmakers look upon when constructing their own cinema classics. Francis Ford Coppola was a master producer and film director in his efforts for The Godfather to be brought from the page to the screen. And with an ensemble cast and sets that could rival the biblical epics of Cecille B. DeMille, The Godfather rightfully has its own place in cinema history.

Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael, and Robert Duvall as consigliere Tom Hagen are just a few of the big names that ultimately rounded out the cast. But in 1972, they were virtually unknown, with the exception of Brando; he had been well known in the business for close to twenty-five years with hits like On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire. Brando became more infamous after the film was released with his Academy Award non-acceptance speech being delivered by Maria Louise Cruz, better known by her made up name of Sacheen Littlefeather. Pacino and Duvall have both had illustrious careers since The Godfather, appearing in numerous films and television programs.

Francis Ford Coppola had a great career after The Godfather as well, but never with the same height of success. The 1970s were his best years in the film industry in my opinion; but he never quite found the same level of success after The Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now. He had some critical hits here and there, namely with Peggy Sue Got Married in 1986 (starring Kathleen Turner and Nicolas Cage (Francis' nephew)). His work on The Godfather Part III in 1990 was panned by critics, and the film doesn't have the same movement and flow as the first two. It's almost best to forget Part 3 when watching The Godfather saga.

There are multiple versions of the first two films that were later edited for television as The Godfather Saga: 1901-1959, which brings the story to the viewer in chronological order instead of the flashbacks. Coppola did this to raise funds and finish his Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now. In all versions of The Godfather, there was much omitted from Mario Puzo's book, for time and content. If you love the movies, definitely read the book."
1,Number one movie? It's madness I tell you... madness.,"I'm voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same. I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected."
10,Amazing,"""The Godfather (1972) is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends time. Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, embodying power and vulnerability. Coppola's direction weaves an intricate narrative of crime, family, and power dynamics. The film's cinematography and score are timeless, creating an immersive experience. The Godfather is not just a mob saga; it's a profound exploration of morality, loyalty, and the American Dream. Every scene is a stroke of genius, making it a classic that continues to captivate audiences, leaving an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape.""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
10,Even the cat acts well lmao,"The best movie I've ever seen in my life and, of course, the best movie in the world, Marlon Brando is just excellent as The Godfather, the performances of the whole actors are beautiful. Even the extras acts good(including the cat lmao) I think this movie is the example of ""how to do the best movie in the history"". The best movie, just that."
10,A Very Good Crime Drama,"The Godfather is one of those movies that is good only for what it is. Some very dramatic moments, good dialog, some good romance, likable characters and a complete story. Its an overall very good film but not the most rewatchable in my opinion."
10,Just a true masterpiece,"I'll just start this review by saying this is the best movie ever made and I am not ashamed to say that. I don't care what other people say. The fact that this movie was made in the 70s makes it even more impressive. They didn't have the equipment and the camera and audio quality that we have today, but that is not what makes this movie great.

Mario Puzo's writing combined with the direction and portray on the mafia by Francis Ford Coppola make this movie a complete must watch.

It may be long, but it is very much worth it. This along with The Godfather Part 2 are the best movies I've ever watched and the best movies ever made in the history of the movie industry."
10,In the top ten,Probably one of the greatest movies ever made to date. The carbage movies today can't even come close.
10,This movie is beautiful.,"I really love this movie, and it is my favorite out of all three. They are unable to fully describe in words, they are masterpieces. This and the other two movies inspired me and moved me emotionally. I was crying at the end of the third movie! I felt as though I knew the characters personally, and felt anger and grief and sorrow and happiness throughout the rise and near fall of the Corleone Family. This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made, and you haven't lived yet if you love movies and haven't seen these films."
7,"Not the greatest film ever made, but still incredibly solid","There's so many perfect executed scenes through The Godfather that it can be easy to underrate how nicely shaped the movie is, sometimes too overblown in that Coppola manner, but the transition between generations and with that capitalist periods is achieved with the precision.

The movie is at its best when it goes all in its notions of tribalism and how they contrast with Pacino's Michael for whom so much of it is mere an easy excuse, his disconnect from his family beyond an ideal (outside of those scenes after his dad gets shot even those have a performative dutiful quality) give the movie most of its emotional stakes. Blood relations justifies murder and by the end that's really the only function it has.

Duvall probably gives the movie most all-around performance because he is the only for who the mantra ""it's just business"" really applies, Coppola strains a lot to make the movie large political observations, but they most work on his scenes as he has such a solid mix of people pleasing skills keeping everyone relaxed and constant annoyance that the work has to deal with so much gangland hits and horse beheadings. My favorite bit about the film climax is his final scene with Vigoda because the latter sells the desperation that plays strong against Duvall's annoyance that the matter must be dealt at all, it is no coincidence Coppola treats it as a privileged moment in the middle of fireworks effects that dominate Michael's large vendetta.

I must say I don't particular care for the movie final scenes, it mostly seems to die alongside Brando, not because he is the center or even the main attraction, but after that it seems happy with just performing Michael supposedly damnation and the scenes that related to that are the movie phoniest parts, it would take part III for any of Michael's damnation to achieve some human dimension beyond a rhetorical gambit that lets the audience more off the hook. Pacino's performance is at his best when it is clearly the Michael gets a kick of power and as a whole The Godfather is less about America or capital than it is about corruption and how seductive and awesome it truly is (one might of course argue all these three things are inseparable in Coppola's conception, but one of them take primary interest).

I'm less crazy about Coppola's Viscontian aspirations than most, but The Godfather do get a lot of its shifting between the grandiose operatic nature and the smaller bits of business that give it foundation like Michael desperation trying to get the gun or even better the baker tension at playing bodyguard a bit early or the split second Fredo understands Michael is really there to make his Vegas vacation over.

My favorite Brando bit in the movie is his scenes with Lattieri and I think it is mostly how Lattieri is the only actor who treats the movie as pure pulp so he gives Brando a different energy to bounce off. Their scene is about contrasting ideologies on the business, but it exists completely on the moment as a very specific thing and not discourse and that gets through some of Brando more mannered tics. By the same token, I love Sonny's execution or earlier his beatdown of Carlo because they seem like they could come from an Italian Godfather knockoff from two earlier later, I don't think the movie would be half as memorable if it was all like that, but I do think it would also be much worse if Coppola's just settle for the Hollywood wannabe arthouse film that it often gets praised as, the body of the gangster flick remains there and a lot of thrills are cheap.

That's also probably why the thing I take the most out of The Godfather are the parade of character actor faces just going through their beats, the fading stars like Conte or Hayden who are there for their associations, but all those less well known Italian American guys (Castellano, Vigoda, Lattieri, Rocco, even Cazale who really gets surprising little to do, but who every reaction seems perfect)."
3,It' looks expensive,"I saw Godfather when it came out. I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.

I recall hearing that Brando stuffed cotton balls in his cheeks to get that effect and I couldn't not think about it during the movie. It looks like a lot of movie was spent on this movie to create the look of a certain era but so what.

I could see people's lips moving and hear people talking but the dialog might as well have been entirely in Italian as I had trouble paying attention. My mind would wander and I really didn't follow the plot or care. For some reason, the dialog seemed trapped in the movie itself as though I was watching it through a window that was muffling the sound a bit. Weird.

Many people may think this is the best movie ever but many people also thought the earth was flat in 1491. When it comes to movies, it only matters to me what I think."
10,Perfect,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolute masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film masterfully captures the essence of power, family, loyalty, and corruption within the intricate world of the Mafia.

From the iconic performances of Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone to Al Pacino's stunning portrayal of Michael Corleone's transformation, every actor brings depth and intensity to their roles. The screenplay, filled with memorable lines, weaves a complex and engaging narrative, keeping the audience captivated from the opening wedding scene to the unforgettable conclusion.

The cinematography, direction, and hauntingly beautiful score by Nino Rota elevate the film to an artistic triumph. ""The Godfather"" isn't just a gangster movie-it's a profound exploration of human nature and the costs of ambition and power.

In short, ""The Godfather"" is a timeless, cinematic achievement that is as relevant today as it was at its release. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates masterful storytelling and unforgettable performances."
10,A perfect film with one flaw,"Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be expect for one. As for the storytelling, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass. A perfect film with one singular flaw which is it sequel somehow is better then it. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character, and more than a few minor ones, is molded into a distinct, complex individual. With each actor absolutely nailing the role. Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world. Would be considered the greatest movie of all time if it was not for its squeal."
10,The definitive masterpiece,"I won't say much about this. This is perfect at every level. The story, epic. The acting and dialogue, memorables. The pace, irreproachable. The editing, precise. The score, iconic. Francis Lord Coppola creating the definitive master piece. The master piece of master pieces, executing everything as perfectly as it ever something was excecuted."
10,wow,Awsome very amazing story i love it Awsome very amazing story i love it Awsome very amazing story i love it Awsome very amazing story i love it
10,Best Mafia movie,"I do not like old school movies, but it is my number movie off all times. There are certain things in life that are so exquisite that 26 Alphabets seem inadequate to adequately explain them. They go beyond the limited scope of the 26 alphabets. Instead of rating or reviewing such things, you should personally experience them. One of the most exquisite motion pictures and television shows ever made. I mean, if they were able to make such high-caliber films in 1970, which the most skilled individuals are unable to do so in 2021, then the folks who built and developed this were truly ahead of their time. It will be unusual to see this 1970s-created, 1950s-based sitcom in 2021. I have a tendency to screenshot the moments that would make the most stunning posters."
10,"The best was, the best is, and the best will be for many decades","This is the best movie ever made, alongside with Godfather part II. I have no words to describe this, it's simply wonderful. I can't find even one little flaw. How could I? The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is the best ever done, the acting by Pacino, Brando, Duvall and the rest are astonishing. The cinematography and script couldn't be done better. This movie, if people will live in earth for many centuries, ain't never gonan be forgoten. This is something that even in the year 3002, parents must show to their children, so they'd understand what means a masterpiece. The only movie who came close to Godfather I and II is Schindler's List. So 30 years gonna and only one movie came close. The best movie ever made. 101 stars out of 100."
1,OMFG - This movie is so overrated it's disgusting,"A 9.1 on IMDb? cat-scans please .I've never seen a worse depiction of Italians in my life. More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero."
10,Best movie that I have ever seen,"I watched this again this year in 2024, the first time I saw this movie was 1973. I've seen it at least six times. I can't believe how wonderful this movie is. It is so great on so many levels. Brandois unbelievable, as the Godfather, and Michael Corleone, the succeeding Godfather is almost as wonderful. Sonny is amazing, and all the other support actors and actresses are. There are so many elements of this film that are wonderful, including all the references to Italian culture, mobster attitudes, and references to respect, revenge, violence, and remorse that will make this a movie that will be remembered forever."
10,asombroso,"Cuenta una gran historia, cuenta con un buen elenco muy recomendada"
10,Fantastic production,Obviously this is the greatest production of world. Best direction Best actress Best music composition Best edit and best story for ever and ever
10,Arguably the greatest film of all time,"The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family as they enter into a dispute between the 5 families.

This movie is insanely well crafted and when you pair that with a phenomenal cast you get what many consider to be the greatest film ever made.

There are really two key stories taking place in this film. First we see the development of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino, his character is given a great arc in the film and you really get to see the impact that the life of crime has on a person. The second key story is essentially the rest of the Corleone family. Sure we get certain subplots involving different members of the family, but it all is really used to show this life of crime.

If you are someone that has been raised on fast paced blockbusters I suggest you steer clear of this film because you will find it very slow. But if you are someone that loves movies that dive into and explore a character and certain themes, this film is for you. The film does a phenomenal job of having a really straightforward story. We first get introduced to the characters and get a good sense of what makes them tick. As the story progresses it sets up different plot points and conflicts that leave you guessing what exactly is going to happen. These plot points and conflicts are constantly being developed and resolved throughout the film, and when you get to the end it leaves you with a very satisfying conclusion that wraps everything up perfectly.

Overall this is a phenomenal film. The amazing construction of the story paired with an insanely talented cast will please any movie lover.

10/10."
9,"Coppola's masterpiece about Italian gangsters in the 1940s with Brando, Pacino, Caan & Duvall","RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.

MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the ""hysterical"" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.

I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, ""The Godfather"" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.

Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's ""Bullitt""); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent ""love at first sight"" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.

What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.

GRADE: A"
10,Godfather,"This movie is solidly in the top 5 of ALL MOVIES that have ever been made and you could easily make a strong case for it being the best movie of every movie ever made. It was based on Puzo's best seller and the adapted screenplay from Puzo's work is absolutely sublime. It features one of the most stellar collection of actors every brought together for one film, with the performance of Brando leading the way. The cinematography is superb from the opening fade in back shot over Brando's shoulder {cat in lap} to the doubting stare on Diane Keaton's face as Al Neiri closes the office door in what works as what cinematographer's refer to as a closing wipe. Using the closing door to ""wipe "" the scene and end the movie, makes it one of the more recognizable and memorable endings to any movie.

Sadly, younger people who grew up on movies that use special effects as a crutch, will not be able to comprehend that movies that are driven by a great plot line and outstanding acting are actually superior to effects driven movies.

Giving this movie a 1 out of 10 deserves no less than one year incarceration for re-education training using another great 1970's movie approach in plot, the Malcolm McDowell forced open eyelid rectification in a "" Clockwork Orange"" , until the realization sinks in that movies like Spiderman or Jurasic Park while being very good are mere shadows to the great classics in movie history."
7,Classic film,"The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...

Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:

Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather- steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer..."
10,The best movie I have ever seen,"The Godfather is my favourite and the best movie for. I've watched it over and over for so many times. It showed me the reality aspect out of those ideal heroic epics. It taught me how to be a truely good son, boyfriend or person. It's such a masterpiece."

Awesome Movie I have ever seen.

Ratings 10/10. Love you the movie maker."
10,"Literally, A Masterpiece!","Truth be told, The Godfather doesn't need a review. Without undue emphasis, Francis Ford Coppola's direction, Brando's and Pacino's performances are literally flawless.

The first time I watched ""The Godfather"", I was a child and it was the most astonishing film I'd ever seen. Due to my introversion, I was spending too much leisure time in front of TV, and consequently I watched many films during my childhood. However, I can hardly remember those films. But The Godfather isn't one of them. I remember The Godfather as if I watched it yesterday. The Godfather made me experience feelings of admiration. There is almost no film that has 3 hours running time and didn't bore me. But The Godfather was a breathtaking film for me.

I admire Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for reducing the thick, best-selling book to the controllable screenplay which anticipated the expectations of the millions who had already read the book. For me, the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters.

Seeing 'The Godfather' is still one of the biggest milestones of the film industry 46 years after its release confirms the film's status as an outdated masterpiece.

Whenever I see it, it becomes better and impeccable."
9,Simply a Masterpiece.,"It's a great film in the history of film. Such a well sculpted film- making. Must watch to experience the true art of film. What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a ""MUST SEE"" movie don't miss it."
7,Best of All,"This movie is the best movie i have watched so far. I would recommend this movie to all of you people must have a look on it once this is insane.

In an interview with the Dailytimes, Sheth Jeebun talked about the importance of sustainability and the impacts of overconsumption of carbohydrates on the human body. He said that he makes all the Aster Health Care homes completely paper-free with technology to reduce the carbon footprints."
5,Didn't get it!,"Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze!

The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the ""family business"". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-...

But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't ""doing anything"" for me. The entire notion of ""honor"" and ""chivalry"" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth.

Rating 5/10

Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"
9,"Epic movie, almost as good as part 2","Great storytelling, every shot mathers and is done with perfection. The devolopment of the characters is stunning, especially Michaels. Al Pacino is just as good as Marlon Brando in this masterpiece. Only to be surpassed by part 2. Which is something that usually never happens."
10,Extraordinary Film,"I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, ""Omerta"" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime. Cinematic masterpiece."
10,Best of all,"Definitely a classic. It never gets old! True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. Must see."
10,"GREAT FILM, STRONG ACTING",This is a strong film with great acting. Marlon is at this BEST in this film. The story line is strong and well written. Audiences are holding on to every moment to see what is going to happen next. #FABULOUS
10,nice movie,Nice movie and best action i watching. I am very enjoy this movie with my friend and good time when i relaxing also with all of my family in the home everyday to watching nonstop.
10,Nice,"I am not a big fan of the sequels even the second is a big step down from this one. What a cast? Like an earlier reviewer said; REWATCHABLE!! Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it hundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the supporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as Barzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you in and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the other. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in the second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be seen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito but colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking in; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who didn't want to get his hands dirty. This is the answer to the riddle of how he could kill Fredo, his own brother, later in the second one. Notice where he sits at the wedding, as far away from the family as he can get."
7,I might be in the minority who read the book first,"And i have to say the book is so captivating and gives so many additional layers to the characters presented in the movie. ""The Godfather"" is very well directed and acted film. Also, almost all the scenes are very truthful to the source material. No wonder the movie is ""Mario Puzo's The Godfather"". From a classical movie perspective there's a lot to appreciate. I think they tried to be as authentic as possible casting Italian actors, but some were pretty weak in their performance. Also some didn't fit the character very well - I really can't accept Robert Duval as Tom Hagen. The ending of the movie also felt so much more rushed. With the pace it was all going I thought the ending of the book was going to be unfolder in the second movie, but that wasn't the case. Suddenly everything just happened quickly and that was it. I don't know, but I'm getting regrets that I didn't see the movie first. Honestly, Mario Puzo set the bar pretty high."
4,I don't get it,"OK, I REALLY don't get it. I always thought: ""Oh well, the Godfather, masterpiece, everyone has to watch it at least once in their live, let's see it then (someday)"". Then today I finally decided myself to watch it and I was shocked about it.

To make it short, it was boring, WAY to long for the amount of real action (and I don't mean Micheal bay action, I mean something like a traceable storyline that doesn't introduce new names and character every time something really happens (and thats not often the case) so that in the end, you don't even know who's who and what is really happening. I don't like a film where you don't know who is doing the action you see, especially if some of the main characters are so similar that you can't distinguish them in some scenes. Also, the film is too long. Take the first set for example, the wedding (or was it a wedding?). If you count all the minutes you see some macaroni's dancing without sense or entertaining the viewer, I think it's around 5 to 10mins. If you look at that you know why the movie is around 3 hours long. Coming to the characters, I didn't have any emotional relationship to them after 3 hours of nearly non-stop conversation. I didn't really care when they died, first because in most cases, I didn't know who was killed in the scene most times and second, because I had no emotions for them. (Let's take that scene near the end, where all the people get killed, like 5 or 6 in three different locations. I didn't even recognize one of them, the whole scene didn't make sense for me. Why would they shoot a women with their child in the bed, especially if the viewer doesn't know who (the f**k) she is??? Not really a pro for a so-called ""masterpiece"") The only two pros I have are the acting and the music. I have to say I'm not a pro in commenting acting in films (watched Catwoman and didn't have a clue why Halle Berry became the golden raspberry for their acting after learning all that stuff with the walking like a cat, martial arts etc.). But I have to say what I've seen in this film is the most natural acting possible. None of the scenes looks contrived, the ""we are all family"" part came very good. Also the soundtrack is really worth recognizing.

To sum it up:

Acting: 10/10 Storyline: 4/10 (really disappointing) Action: 3/10 (even more disappointing) Lenght: 2/10 Soundtrack: 8/10

Overall: Around 4-5/10, I'll give it 4 because it's overrated.

PS: I watched ""The Rock"" the same day and found it much better than ""The Godfather"" (Better action, no lenghts, even better soundtrack, a very simple but at least traceable story)"
10,Best Movie ever,"Best Movie ever, i have watched this movie with 5 of my friend last monday when i was in sulamaniyah, it was the best, and i am also planning to watch it with my wife next friday when im back to erbil."
10,Mükemmel,Hayatimda seyrettigimiz en guzel filmlerden biriydi kim yaptiysa helal olsun
10,A Perfect Masterpiece By Its Definition,"The Godfather (1972) 10/10!!!

Yep, it is still perfect! My 4th viewing ✅ and my opinion hasn't changed one bit. I have actually notice a couple of new things that have made me appreciate the film even more! Quite frankly, it really ie insane just how good it is and how even 50 years later, it totally still holds up! A masterpiece of complete brilliance with genius storylines interconnected so beautifully ultimately making it super satisfying for audiences to connect the dots and really understand what's actually going on. The picture really showcases what life in the mafia is like and it is done with so much heart that you genuinely love and care about these characters as they are actually pretty relatable characters who often make a lot of sense, but yet are unfortunately born into a family full of crime! There are really not that many films out there that successfully manage to give the viewer an exciting and thrilling viewing experience, no matter how often they watch it. A real masterpiece by its definition filled with all-time great and iconic performances that essentially make up for an iconic, timeless classic that really has stood the test of time and presumably will be relevant! One of those films humanity can be proud of when looking back at pop cultural trends that have happened over time. Always a genuine privilege for me whenever I watch this beauty! 10/10."
9,The Godfather,"This film is definitely an important step in the world of cinema, the acting is great, the plot is great, everything about it is great. I however do not consider it to be one of my favourite films of all time, a very enjoyable film no doubt but in my view not something I'd put in my top ten."
10,A towering masterpiece in cinematic history.,"It is sort of disheartening to read the plethora of negative reviews of this film on IMDb. There seems to be a fundamental gap between those who understand and appreciate the history and the evolution of cinema and those whose powers of perception and attention spans have been impaired by mind-numbing video games and by a culture of total immersion in the utter banality of ""social media."" I even read one negative review which seriously attempted to draw a comparison between ""The Godfather"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I loved both movies by the way, but FOR CHRISSAKES! It's apples and oranges! One of those movies was a thoughtful, introspective ADULT film, which are few and far between. The other film, though great entertainment, was not.

The acting (across the board), the script (almost entirely Coppola's) and directing (entirely Coppola's) in the ""The Godfather,"" though arguably equaled on occasion, have never been bested by any Hollywood or independent film. One qualification here: to the amazement of every film critic and everyone else alive in the 20th Century, the movie ""The Godfather"" was actually eclipsed by ""The Godfather, Part II,"" which really needs to be seen back-to-back with ""The Godfather"" in order to fully appreciate either film. The two films in combination are really just the 1st and 2nd halves of Mario Puzo's pulp fiction book, entitled ""The Godfather."" Coppola's screenplay elevated Puzo's 2nd-rate prose immeasurably, and together those two films constitute the single greatest piece of epic-scale movie-making in the history of American cinema."
7,as a director,I think if you want to learn story board of drama movie you must see this film.and break down the shots - its awesome movie for watching - the lighting is weak.
1,It insists upon itself.,"The Godfather is a movie that just insists upon itself. From the very first scene, it insists upon itself. Every line of dialogue, every dramatic pause, every lingering shot-it all just insists upon itself. The cinematography? Insists upon itself. The characters? Insist upon themselves. The entire aura of the film? Pure insistence. It doesn't invite you in; it forces itself upon you, demanding admiration. But why? Because it insists upon itself. It's not subtle, it's not effortless-it's insistence, through and through. And that, quite frankly, is too much insistence for me. It insists upon itself."
10,"This is a great film about family and loyalty, with a taste of crime that's great and suspenseful every second!","The Godfather is the best movie of all time. It was made so great, with great plot, with a lot of suspense, and great acting. This movie in my opinion has had the best cast ever-- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. If you haven't watched this yet, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse! WATCH IT!"
10,Must be watched at least once by everyone.,A work of art that will always remain on the list of the greatest of all time. I was a kid when I first watched it. I've watched it dozens of times. It fascinates with its details every time I watch it.
10,Godfather,"Absolute masterpiece, Marlon brando's finest work as Vito. Truly iconic scenes swell."
10,Masterpiece. Glad I could watch it on the big screen,"Well, it's year 2022, 50th anniversary of what is considered one of the best movie ever made, often taken as an example when it comes to scriptwriting, filming, directing, acting, editing, score, themes... you name it.

If you are into film making... this masterpiece will teach a lot.

Personally how character development and pacing in editing are my favorite parts of a movie.

Anyway.. you watched it 4-5 times. Only on TV/small screen.

It gets remastered/restored after a long process.

You go watch it on a big screen, as intended to be experienced.

Amazing experience."
10,Legend,"A legendary film, great performance and storytelling. Marlon Brando acts like a genuine mafia boss that walked on set. Music score really makes the emotions of the film better."
10,Simple and Incredible.,"I am 19 years old, but I've been seeing and listening about this movie my whole life, so I finally sat and watched it. And it is astonishing by the fact, that what turns the movie to be so good is, the most common, usual, old conversations (knowing what that conversation will lead to). I enjoy Mafia movies since day one, so watching this masterpiece was like playing Mafia games. The Godfather has on hands an incredible cast. I do believe Al Pacino was born to portray mobsters in Mafia movies, and you clearly see how good he is, since the Dinosaurs age. (old times if you didn't understand what supposed to be a ""joke"")."
7,Award Winning Movie,Watched it and I must say it had a very different story and marvelous dialogues that can create an impact.
1,It insists upon itself.,"The title and EXTREMELY overrated, hyped by bunch of fat wannabe Italian gangster discord mod people. Would've rated it higher if not for the bad audience. I mean the movie is pretty average but it doesn't belong anywhere in the top 100, I just would NEVER recommend these 3 trash films to someone wasting 9 hours of their lives."
10,Awesome Movie,"This movie was one of the best movies ever made and it is the first movie made that cause me to be a film maker. Growing up I use to watch gangster movies and those movies reflected the neighborhoods and people I knew growing up. Also, I could actually feel like I was going through what the characters of this movie was going through."
10,What's First or Second...?,"Well, When first time I watched The movie it was not so cool to me I mean not so well, I don't know my mind try to say go and watch that again well I watched again but this time 'not bad',Again third time my mind say go and watch again,Third time when I watched, It Was Masterpiece for AllTime!"
10,A Masterpiece.,"Everyone in this movie has outstanding acting, especially Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, And John Cazale. Every time I watch this piece of art I forget that it's a movie due to the fact that the acting is so incredible."
9,A movie worth its actors!,"A must watch for every movie buff and specially for Fans of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The story shows how a man balances his work and family so well keeping in mind that his business is full of threat. Character of Vito Corleone defines what a real man is like and on the other hand Character of Michael Corleone shows how to contain anger and utilize it in most lethal way possible. This Story also shows how the mafia families have ruled the cities with both good and bad to their characters.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen."
10,MASTERPIECE !,"The greatest movie of all time,this movie is masterpiece,legendary!"
10,The Greatest Film of All Time,"If there were one film that I would say you should watch before you die, it is this one. This is the definition of a perfect film. Every aspect of it is brilliant and amazing. The acting, the story, the filmmaking, everything is incredible."
5,nice,Nice one. I recommend must watch. I saw this 1000 time.
10,Why the Godfather Still Hits Like a Shot to the Chest,"So The Godfather (1972)? Absolute chef's kiss. It's one of those rare movies that lives up to the hype, and somehow feels even better when you watch it again. Like a good espresso - it's rich, it's dark, and it doesn't mess around. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone? He doesn't moves, doesn't talks above a whisper, and still somehow commands the entire room. It's like watching a lion yawn - you're just waiting for someone to lose a limb. And Al Pacino? Ugh. Baby-faced war hero to cold-blooded boss? The transformation is so slow and subtle, you don't even realize you've crossed the line with him until BAM - you're in the dark with him and you're like, ""Oh... we're here now."" It's not fast-paced, and it makes you wait, but every second is worth it. The tension builds like pressure in a moka pot - you can feel something brewing, and when it explodes, it explodes. The whole vibe is steeped in old-school drama. Everything's lit, full of shadows and brown tones like an antique coffee shop where the espresso tastes like it's seen some things. And the quotes? Iconic. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" It's cool. The ending? When the door closes on Kay? That final shot is haunting. Like... you knew it was coming, but it still hits you in the chest. That's how you do a character arc. If you haven't watched it yet - or haven't in a bit -this is your sign. Make a cup of coffee, turn off the lights, and let yourself get sucked into that world. It's the kind of movie that sticks to your ribs. Ten outta ten cannoli. No notes."
10,Fantastic,"I have seen many many movies and this is simply one of the best. My 2nd favorite film of all time. If you havent seen this film, get up and go to your local blockbuster. Forget that, just go buy it since you'll want to view it many many times. Be sure to get The Godfather Part II while you're there."
10,Brilliant,"Yesterday, I was lucky to be able to watch 175 minutes of pure movie magic, restored and at a big screen, thanks to Cnema in Norrköping.

The pros: The incredible attention to detail in this impressively well-written and directed film. The iconic characters and intrigues that have since been the model for so many mafia movies. The brilliant acting from great Marlon Brando. The music by composer Nino Rota that is now almost more famous than the movie itself.

The cons: Marlon Brando is dead and Francis Ford Coppola haven't reached this level of mastery again since ""Apocalypse Now"" in 1979."
10,The Greatest Mob Movie.,"The greatest movie of all time. The story, characters, and cinematography. I thought movies in the 1900's was a little weird, (Even though I was younger back then.) But I think people have problems with the pacing. It's slow, but its worth watching. It has the best sequel, but the 3rd movie sucks (From what I heard.) I honestly think that this movie should have done a clean Oscar sweep, but I am not complaining. Ever since I've watched this movie, I've started to watch much more other movies like, The Shawshank Redemption, 2001: A Space Odyssey , Creed, Rocky, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and many more. Thanks to The Godfather."
10,The Godfather,"An iconic movie.

It was based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel."
6,It was alright,"Even quite tense at times - that restaurant scene had my heart pounding, as did the hospital scene. But it is overhyped. Okay, scene composition and direction are top notch, yadda yadda, acting is phenomenal, but you can't watch it without thinking ""everyone says this is the greatest film of all time"". Well maybe it is for some, but the film suffers from high expectations as a consequence. Not that you, gentle reader, are interested, but I didn't rate it as highly as Apocalypse Now, Seven Samurai or even Star Wars, but it deserves a respectable 8/10 and if you haven't seen it, its worth 3 hours of your time.

Just don't believe the hype."
1,Grossly and undeservingly overrated!,"I watched the DVD recently because everyone seems to be hyped about this 'greatest movie on earth'!! Well, I wouldn't waste your valuable time any further writing a lot here after wasting my good 3 hours watching so called God Father. I nearly died of boredom. Simply, this is one of the most boring, longest movies I have ever watched. And it is horrible! Is it a great story? No. Is it a great movie? NOT AT ALL!! It is just a welded work of so many boring, long celluloid pieces together. There is no stature, depth, matter or even an exciting plot. After all, Brando is a good actor but not that great in this one for sure. And I am still at a loss to understand why people give this rut 9.2!! It would of course be totally right just without the 9!"
10,No one can beat it. one cult classic movie ever,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.

Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.

The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).

The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute."
9,Immense film but about disgusting characters,"The fabulous opening shot and scene immediately establish the spirit and essence of things. ""I've spent my life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men"", says Vito Corleone. It's a great film, an immense narrative that stretches effortlessly over nearly three hours.

But nothing is truer than when Connie calls her brother Michael, Vito's son, a ""lousy cold-hearted b...rd."" That's what he is, a cold, heartless killer, a liar with no morals, a snake. That's the limit of the film, absolutely impressive in its narration and direction but giving life to repulsive characters."
10,A true classic,I cant count how many times i have watched this movie. And i love it even more with every watch. If you havent watched then youve missed a big part of film history!!
10,Best movie of all time,"There is nothing more to say The sences are longer than avarage, I think thats the reason many people are finding it boring but the acting is outstanding, even with not including the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando, that is widely considered as the best performance of the best actor of all time. I have seen this movie hundreds of times and every time I love it more"
9,Louis Restaurant subtitles,"I hope nobody minds, but there was some discussion about missing English subtitles in the Louis Restaurant meeting scene with Michael and Sollozzo, and I had difficulty finding any apart from a general translation found here which does little to help beat and continuity.

I think this effort does the trick, it fits the dialogue as far as I can tell, not being even passing fluent in Italian. But I don't think subtitles should be exact translation anyway; different languages have their own feel to them.

If I am in breach of anyone's copyright after all these years, please let me know.

6,A victim to its hype.,"When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful.

Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it.

9.5/10"
1,Overrated to the extent that perhaps makes me underrate it,"This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays."
10,Nothing Compares,"One of the outstanding movie. Actors are very professional and they are giving justice to their characters. Salute to them.

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
10,A very good movie about very bad people,"Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries. THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.

The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York. He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. ""Michael,"" significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three. Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business. He is something of an outsider to his family.

But Michael is devoted to his father. And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil ""the Turk"" Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life. Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.

The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen. It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds. Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers! Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister. This tragic irony suffuses the film. The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.

Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender. The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the ""consigliere"" or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo. Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.

Enter a world where murder is ""not personal. It's strictly business."" You will never forget it.

Rating: **** out of ****."
9,If Perfection was a Movie,One of the most perfect films of all time. This movie is a must watch and a must watch again. It captures society in the mafia era in the United States. The main thematic conflict is between good and evil and the decent to the dark side for the main character Michael. The movie has a great dichotomy between the purity of religion and crime. Francis Ford Copolla has directed a master piece in this first of the trilogy.
10,Must watch,"If they ask me which films will remain excellent forever, one of the first in this category will be «Godfather». To the word, it is the color and storyline basis of «Godfather» has won recognition of many critics and lovers of similar cinema. The background, excluding Sicilian landscapes and grape fields, is less dynamic, giving preference to acting. The risk was high, as the producers of the film had long been unable to understand the situation inside the work, taking away Coppola's directorial powers, and removing Brando from the main role. And what is most gratifying is that the end result has already been recognized as a classic, and the leading performers will remain in the annals of history for a long time to come. Everyone must see this masterpiece! 10 out of 10"
10,Still the best after all these years. Flawless. Bravo.,"It's 2020, there was nothing else I felt like watching, so here I was watching Godfather for the 3rd time in my life. I thought I would just let it play in the background while i browsed my phone.

At the first scene, I watched & listened to the man sitting before Don Corleone, fully decided that I would just hear him out and then get back to browsing my phone.

But when Don Corleone appeared, all that changed. I was hypnotized. He commanded the screen. I could not look away. It was impossible. I had completely forgotten about my phone.

I sat there thinking to myself, how can this be? It's 2020 and this film is even better than I remembered it. I've watched this before already, I've watched countless of critically acclaimed films since then, why is this film having this kind of effect on me now?

For close to 3 hrs, I had forgotten where I was. All I knew was that I was part of their family. I was there with them in every meeting and planning. And I felt every worry, every betrayal, every attack, every death.

What a beautiful brilliant movie. Superb cast, script, music, direction & cinematography. Faultless. Timeless. Breathtaking. A true masterpiece. 10/10. The same rating every time I watch it."
10,The must watch movie of the century,"This in my opinion is the top of must watch list. The drama, the story-line, the twist, and everything about it sets the benchmark of movies of today."
6,good movie for it's time!,"If you're someone who was born in 2000s and have watched cinema as a normal person does, you might have seen the adaptions of the same storyline a lot of times with better graphics, action, soundtrack. And then this movie ain't gonna be any different for you. It might have been revolutionary for its time because it brought a new storyline in the world of cinema, but now I have seen this exact narrative so many times, it's predictable for me. So for me, it was a 6/10. Actually it was somewhat disappointing because seeing a rating of 9.2 I was expecting my mind to be blown away. Sure the movie was not bad, but not good enough for a 9.2 rating? Seeing people rate this so high in 2020s seem weird to me."
1,Overrated,"Either someone stuffed the ballot box on this one or people are merely voting for an icon without really thinking about it. This movie does not even remotely deserve its reputation. There is no significant character development; it is too long (and that's an understatement); and in quite a few places, the plot drags interminably."
10,The best film of all time. End of!,"The Godfather is a timeless classic. Everything about it is just masterful from the performances to the direction to the wonderful soundtrack. Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes. One thing that also surprised me was how despite the Godfather being a three hour film, it is paced very well. I never felt confused or bored whilst watching it. It is an amazing film.

10,The greatest movie ever made,"Coppola's masterpiece is the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. The actors are amazing, the roles are fit perfect to the actors, the plot is fantastic, and the music.... that music is perfect, it is terrifying, and give you goosebumps, and fit absolutely to the depressing moments of the The Godfather. I recommend this movie to everyone who can appreciate the pleasure of the movie arts."
10,the best,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.

The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.

""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.

Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.

But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.

The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).

The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.

Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.

Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
10,Fabulous movie,"I absolutely appreciate all the artists of this movie, And character of Michael is superb."
10,The only film I'd call flawless.,There is no movie quite like The Godfather. It was the movie that gave me a true respect for film and motivated me to seek out something else over those few family friendly flicks I'd see twice a year at the theater. Now I watch nearly a hundred every year and yet I've never found anything quite like this masterpiece. It's the type you can watch over and over again and somehow find new things that make you respect the film even more. It's really an experience to watch and everyone should see it at some point in their lives.
10,Much more than a great movie,"A magnificent work of art! Timeless. Exposes all the strength and human weakness, the true meaning of family in all aspects."
10,Must watch for every movie lover.,"One of the best movies based on the underworld. The story holds you until the end. The terrific performance of the actors are very much convincing. Overall, it's a must-watch for every movie lover."
10,Film of all times,"The Godfather isn't just a film - it's an experience. A cinematic achievement that transcends its genre and has earned its place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Every aspect of this film, from direction to acting, writing to music, is executed with near perfection.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of masterful. He creates a world so rich, atmospheric, and emotionally charged that it pulls you in and doesn't let go. The pacing is deliberate, the tone is mature, and every frame feels intentional.

The performances are iconic. Each actor embodies their role with depth and restraint, bringing complexity and humanity to characters that could have easily become clichés. The film explores power, family, loyalty, and moral conflict in a way that feels both intimate and epic.

What sets The Godfather apart is its subtlety. It doesn't rely on spectacle, but rather on storytelling, character, and mood. It's a film you don't just watch - you absorb it, you reflect on it, and you remember it long after it ends.

Whether you're a fan of crime dramas or not, this is essential viewing. A landmark of cinema that continues to inspire filmmakers and captivate audiences decades later."
6,"Good character development and plot but overall, a pretty boring film",The Godfather shows character development extremely well and the minimal action in the film is engaging but the film overall is convoluted and dull. I personally wouldn't put this in a top 100 list but maybe I'm missing something.
1,Maybe if the horse head got some lines it would be more interesting...,"Long and boring and not worth writing two sentences. But since I have to, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, I think you get my point!"
10,Classic and perfect,I cant imagine this masterpiece made in 1972 its sooo good from the actors to the soundtrack to the twists to the mafia feel to the ending every thing was made by genius even it was old movie if you watched it you will fell its like in 2010 it was ahead of its time
10,The best movie ever made.,(100/100) The Godfather is a masterpiece and there will likely never be a movie as good or better than The Godfather
10,Excellent,"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.

Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.

Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.

The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy."
10,Extremely good. A must-see in film-history.,Coppola's classic interpretation of storytelling fits perfectly into this tale which many consider to be the greatest film ever made. The tragic life of michael corleone and his family against the background of the 40s new york underworld; a must-see in film-history. The scenes are extremely convincing and the atmosphere is appropriately dark and gloomy. The music accurately captures the epic scale and drama that the film is trying to get across.
9,I can't believe it took me 31 yrs to see this movie!,"The Corleone family saga begins with Brando granting (or refusing) the requests of his friends, family, and neighbors during his daughter's wedding. That's just the beginning of the epic saga that put the name Puzo on the map.

This is a very graphic depiction of the ""family"" scene. It marks the end of one's control of a territory and the dawning of a new era when Pacino takes over the ""family"" business.

If you haven't seen this movie, yet, do yourself a favor: don't wait 30 years like I did. Watch it! It was on one of the premium channels the other night and I taped it. I knew it was three hours long and I always thought I would not have the patience to watch it, but I did. In fact, they are showing part two tonight and I am taping that to watch tomorrow night."
10,Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening,"Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar."
9,Waw!,"Considered to be one of the best movies ever made, and I just finished watching it. This mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

For this movie, I decided not to write a full review as everyone knows how good the Godfather is. It has been an inspiration for all movies that came out after it. The cinematography is amazing, the plot is very grasping, the acting is phenomenal, the script is very well written, the plot twist are so shocking , the three hours run time passes by so quickly, and I could keep going on and on however I would like you to go watch that movie and experience it on your own. You don't have to be a fan of gangster movies to likes this, so you just need to go watch it for yourself as soon as possible and enjoy this masterpiece.

Score:9/10."
7,"Epic adaptation, and a cornerstone of 1970s cinema...","Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990. *** from ****"
1,Stupid!,"The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.

The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.

It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth? I mean I like him as an actor, but this character is absolutely ridiculous.

I don't understand how anyone could give an Oscar for that film! It's just stupid!"
10,Movies that will remain in istory,"The costumes and scenario and offcourse the actors are really good. The sound of the film are great, Al pacino and Marlo Brando excellent acting andthe oter thing i like are the cars really beatiful."
10,i can not love this movie more,"Theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters.

Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making,"
10,10/10,"The only movie I have ever marked as a 10. Masterpiece! The actors, the acting, the storyline, everything combined made Godfather one of the best movie in the cinematographic history."
10,One of the best films I have ever seen,"Could not recommend higher. Does not matter your age, background, etc. And it is not nearly as long as I expected. Sonny as a character and James Cann performance are terrific and reason enough to watch it. Al Pacino is terrific. Duvall an Brando are great."
10,Here are some of the reasons why The Godfather is considered such a great film:,"It is a powerful and engrossing story about family, loyalty, and betrayal. The film is full of memorable characters and scenes, and it tells a story that is both timeless and relevant.

It is a visually stunning film with masterful direction and cinematography. Coppola's direction is impeccable, and the film's cinematography is some of the best ever seen.

It features some of the most iconic performances in film history. Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is considered one of the greatest of all time, and Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone is equally impressive.

It is a film that can be watched and rewatched over and over again, and it always reveals something new. The Godfather is a complex and layered film that is full of hidden meanings and symbolism.

If you have never seen The Godfather, I highly recommend that you do. It is a truly essential film that will stay with you long after you have seen it."
10,"Review of ""The Godfather"" (1972)","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) stands as a cinematic masterpiece, an exemplar of storytelling, character development, and film direction. Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling novel, this film isn't just a chronicle of the mafia underworld but a deep exploration of power, family, and the American dream.

At the heart of the film is the Corleone family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, masterfully played by Marlon Brando. Brando's portrayal is nothing short of iconic, embodying the complexities of a man who is at once a ruthless crime lord and a devoted family man. His raspy voice, deliberate gestures, and the way he cradles a cat in the opening sequence are indelibly etched in the minds of film aficionados.

However, it's not just Brando that shines. The film is replete with remarkable performances. Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, a young man initially resistant to the family business but eventually its most ruthless advocate, is a marvel of character transformation. His transition from an innocent war hero to the cold-blooded Don showcases Pacino's incredible range and depth as an actor.

Cinematographically, ""The Godfather"" is a lesson in subtlety and nuance. Gordon Willis' dark and moody lighting, often referred to as ""Rembrandt lighting"", casts characters in shadows, perfectly capturing the murky moral universe they inhabit. The sepia tones used throughout offer a nostalgic hue, making it feel like a relic from a bygone era, and yet its themes remain timeless.

The plot itself is an intricate web of familial bonds, betrayals, and power struggles, but it never feels convoluted. Instead, the tight narrative and compelling pacing keep viewers riveted. Scenes such as the iconic horse's head in the bed or Michael's restaurant assassination are unforgettable not just for their shock value, but for their narrative significance.

Nino Rota's haunting score is another integral component, weaving together the film's emotional arcs. The melancholic trumpet solo that introduces the main theme is instantly recognizable, echoing the tragic undertones of the story.

Yet, beyond the crime and violence, ""The Godfather"" fundamentally revolves around family. It emphasizes loyalty, tradition, and the lengths one might go to protect their own. This focus on family is what differentiates ""The Godfather"" from other crime dramas and what has resonated deeply with audiences across generations.

Coppola's deft touch is evident throughout. He balances visceral sequences with quieter, introspective moments, allowing characters space to breathe and evolve. The wedding scene at the beginning, juxtaposed with Vito's meetings in his darkened office, is a perfect example of this balance - celebration and joy on one hand, and the murkiness of power deals on the other.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's an experience, an immersion into a world that's both foreign and familiar. It's a tale of ambition, power, and family, masterfully woven together by Coppola and his team. Nearly half a century after its release, it remains as impactful and relevant as ever, a testament to its place in cinematic history."
10,I'm surprised I saw it finally,Watched it with family and I have yet to watch the sequels that I have been demanded to watch aha
2,Watched once,I watched it once (in jail) to see what all the fuss is about. Boring. I would not watch it again. Its appeal confuses me and I like most popular movies.
10,the actuality of American dream........,"I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream."
10,Flawless,"Start to finish, you're into it! Best film I have ever watched!"
10,Best ever movie made in the film industry,Without any doubt there is nothing compare to this movie... I don't have enough words to say how good is this movie.
10,"Quite simply, the finest gangster film ever made","No doubt about it, this a spectacular viewing experience. The acting along with the storyline makes this film a genuine masterpiece. The film covers a wide spectrum of genre keeping the viewer entertained throughout. TOP CLASS!"
10,The Godfather: A Timeless Crime Epic,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the crime genre. Following the Corleone family's rise and struggles, the film explores loyalty, power, and the cost of ambition. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael anchor a stellar cast. The screenplay, haunting score, and masterful direction create an unforgettable experience. Balancing brutality with deep emotional resonance, The Godfather remains a compelling saga of family and betrayal, cementing its place as one of the greatest films ever made. I like this."
10,My favourite,This is awesome movie I enjoyed watching And it's the best movie ever Great job
1,Not very impressed-awful,"Sorry, but i can't believe that this is the most popular film, it dragged on for so long i didn't even see the ending. Don't get me wrong, i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time Al Pacino shot the 'Bad' copper i had to turn off.

The storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didn't care about whatever happened to the characters. How stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemaker's bed, he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind?

I can't think of any reasons why this was a good film, if you do then you better tell me!!"
8,The Beginning of a Star....Al Pacino,"There is not a lot that can be said about the Godfather that has not already been said so i wont bother to give a description of what this masterpiece is about but i will mention a few thing about the acting. It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10."
10,"If cinema is truly the 7th art, this will film will answer the ""what"", the ""how"" and the ""why""","Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.

The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.

Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.

The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can't help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.

The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.

The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years."
8,It insists upon itself,"I'm watching The godfather for the first time in this year of our Lord 2025. You can only see so many movie references and memes before you break and say ""fine. I'll watch the movie""

The movie is iconic not just because of the constant references I see in my daily life, but because the movie is stellar. Fantastic writing, great cast, and it is so well paced despite its nearly 3-hour run time. The movie takes you through so many twists and turns and remained unpredictable, which forces the viewer with questions by the end.

Marlon Brando played the role greatly, but I think the driving force behind this film was actually Al Pacino. Al Pacino outperformed Brando in my opinion and didn't appear to try as hard.

I'm looking forward to part 2 as I've heard that's the better one."
10,Amazing and Excellent Movie,This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.
10,A Masterpiece,"10-10This movie is great, very good script, great casting, excellent and great acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is More than 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
10,incredible movie,"It was the first event movie of the 70s, the one multitudes queued up to see, the one whose dialogue, characters and imagery instantly became ingrained in the collective consciousness. It made stars of Pacino and Caan, won Oscars for Picture, Screenplay and Brando, in a triumphant comeback. Shortly after its premiere in 1972 Variety reported, ""The Godfather is an historic smash of unprecedented proportions"". At the time the director, Francis Ford Coppola, was holed up in a hotel writing the screenplay for The Great Gatsby, a job he took to relieve his financial problems because he believed in his movie. He had only been given the film after a lengthy wish-list of veterans including Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann and Franklin Schaffner turned it down. He perked up when Frank Capra wrote to him, claiming it was, "" Out of this world. I cheered inwardly at scene after scene."""
10,best movie ever,"""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil"
10,as they said... this movie not happening everyday,"I don't want to talk too much, but the spontaneity of the performance, made me witness to what happened.

I consider myself lucky to stay a life.

A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary."
6,It depends what you want from a film,"If you enjoy action paced movies with great character depth and story telling opt for goodfellas. If you like slow paced, drama like story telling opt for the Godfather. It's wasn't my cup of tea but you can see why people might put it into being considered a classic. The movie for the time when released was ahead of its time. Nowadays it would go straight to dvd."
1,Overrated by critics and old men,"I don't see why this is supposed to be one of the greatest films of all time. I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.

The movie's pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than ""Let's shoot him"" and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot.

The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.

I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.

The one good thing here is the music is good, I'll give it that."
10,"one of, if not the, best films ever made","what can i say, this film is magnificent. everything about it is flawless. i must admit, however, that i am partial to mafia pictures, but that doesn't matter. i'm serious when i say it's a great film. if you haven't seen it yet, please do so as soon as possible. thank you."
10,EPIC DRAMATIZATION UNIQUEISCENCE OF PERFECTION,"The storyline, screenplay and casting, couldnt have been any better. This in its simplicity is the metrics and the kinetics of a pefect cooked pot of delicate stew, seasoned to perfection.

I liked this movie and gave it 3 out of 2 thumbs up for te acting dynamics and realism!"
9,One of the best,"This Film is one of my favorite films of all times. I think that Coppola take a big risk after THX and Zootrope. This is a profound story about human nature trying to balance between the human desire of power the love of family. Every time I have the opportunity of see this film, I try to figure out how Francis resolve anything in the way to make a complete piece about the family issues, but in the same time a great portrait of the Italian mafia that today it's the ambiance and pace formula for the mafia films and also in Mexico the formula for the Mexican cartels. Also the great decision to invite a Al Pacino for the main role it's an excellent direction just below of the Brandon's performance."
10,One of the best movie of all time,"It can really be considered one of the best movies of all time. The cast is simply amazing, stellar. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert de Niro, Diane Keaton, James Caan and many others gathered all together at their most young ages in this masterpiece. The acting is insanely high quality and all of the actors cooperate to create one of the best choral performance of all time. Marlon Brandon is simply amazing, really beyond. The way in which he modulates his voice for the whole duration of the movie and his mouth position gives to the character such a specific personality which could be enough to make the movie itself. Al Pacino, who fought so hard for this part, is simply perfect for the role of the son. It's just incredible the depth and the courage with which he carries his performance for the whole duration of the movie, especially the way he shifts his believes. Remarkable how he works on the evolution of the character. Not to mention the sweat and amazingly talented Diane Keaton, who is just perfect for her role as well mannered girlfriend and later wife of Al Pacino. I couldn't recommend it more. It's one of these movies with an eternal energy; one of these movies people continue watching and watching all over again because of all the shades and other details which you continue discover and discover every time more and better. Go and enjoy!"
9,One Of The Greatest,"I understand that this film has been argued as flawless, but I'm giving it a nine based on two reasons from a personal standpoint. This film can drag on at times which can become a bit dull and Goodfellas I think is a better film so I can't possibly give The Godfather a ten. That being said this film still lives up to the hype. The story is fascinating, the characters are well structured and this movie can really bring out every human emotion in its audience. The runtime be damned, this is a film you can easily watch over and over again."
6,Well not the greatest movie ever made...for me.,"If only this film was not supposed to be the greatest movie ever made...

Had an interesting start. But then it took too long for me to get invested in the characters. And it kind of tries to glorify crime and criminals.

So yeah this movie needs lots of patience. Maybe when it was made it was different and trendsetter.

Oh. The expectations."
2,Has not aged well,"This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making.

Some of the film is amazing, but mostly it goes on and on. It is very long, with some of the scenes taking an age, without really adding to the atmosphere or the point. These are not impressive pauses, silences, looks, stares, or useful dwelling time, simply editing that never happened.

This film is worth seeing as a history lesson in film, to get an understanding of the development of the genre, but anybody who has seen goodfellas, casino, or any other mob flick is unlikely to find the moral tale worth the journey."
10,i likeee this film,Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.
10,The godfather,One of the greatest films of all time the cast the writing the score everything in it and about it is masterful
9,Traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh.,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organised crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptised while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptised in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."
10,A masterpiece that stands the test of time.,"The Godfather is one of those films that you watch and immediately understand why it's considered a classic. It's not just a great mafia movie-it's a masterclass in storytelling, acting, and filmmaking.

Al Pacino is mesmerizing as Michael Corleone, perfectly capturing his transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless mafia boss. And Marlon Brando? Absolutely iconic as Don Vito Corleone. His presence on screen is magnetic, effortlessly commanding attention with just a few words.

The story itself is captivating-centered around family, loyalty, and the choices we make. The pacing might seem slow to some, but it's a slow burn that makes the payoff all the more intense. The tension is built up gradually, and when it finally hits, it's almost unbearable in the best way.

On top of the incredible acting and writing, the film is visually stunning. The cinematography uses shadows and lighting to create a mood that sticks with you long after the credits roll. The score is haunting and beautifully complements the dark, emotional weight of the story.

It's a film that you can watch over and over and still find new layers to appreciate. The Godfather is more than just a movie; it's an experience. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it-it truly lives up to the hype."
10,One of the best films ever made,"The Godfather is really one of the epitomes of what movies should be like. Although it is slow initially but once it gets its pace, its on a whole new level. With some of the best actors and magnificent direction, I guess it is one of the best movies ever made."
10,Beautiful Composition,"This film really opened my eyes to the drama of beautiful cinematography and how compelling you can make an image simply with the framing. Having each shot tell its own story is an incredible element towards crafting an excellent film. In addition to the cinematography, I became a huge fan of Brando because of this film. I read that he used some personal techniques to craft his character and I really admire that now that I am looking for ways to make my own screen-time unique and dynamic. I wish films would continue to use The Godfather as a model for good cinema. There is something missing from modern movie-making that can be rediscovered by watching films like this."
6,"Overlong, And Perhaps Less Vital Then It Once Was","I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir."
2,Not as good as I remember.,"I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.

This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.

Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.

Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might be better.

Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.

A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing. One more thing, this film certainly doesn't deserve to be the best ever, it shouldn't even be in the top one hundred, but it doesn't deserve a ""1"" rating, I only give it that because I want the average rating to go down."
10,Watched in 4k,Still the best and even better with recent 4k transfer. When they released the blurays they did the originals a disserve. It was nice to see them take the time and attention to details and truly restored this classics to its original state. Better dare we say?
10,"This is literally the perfect film, there is no other way someone logical can put it.","One of cinema's greatest achievements. Trimming the fat of the source novel while keeping the mature spirit, The Godfather is an essential watch for anyone who claims to love movies."
9,As Good As It Gets,"Maybe it's Marlon Brando. Maybe it's the score, cinematography, or the memorable characters, but there's just something about the Godfather that sticks with you. It's one of those movies that gets loved more and more as time goes on. It's one of those movie's you wish you could watch again for the first time. It's a movie in everyone top ten. It's a movie I'll be showing my kids. The Godfathers a journey of a reluctant son becoming the thing he swore he'd never become. A businessman, a killer, a Criminal. The Godfather is, without a doubt, one of the most well crafted cinematic masterpieces of all time."
10,My all time fav movie,"I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience. Its tremendous work done. This movie depicts the sincere work with lots of love. No one can bring out such an epic movie, even if paid a billion dollars each. I just get up every time I hear Godfather to watch time and again."
10,Classic,"It's an artistic masterpiece. The story is really great, the characters and the cinematography are outstanding. It shows the real situation of the mobs."
10,Greateast movie of all time in my view,"This must be the best movie I've seen. I watched this movie for over 5 times. Every scene and clue are useful. Those complicated relationship built a web for the fate of the chosen boy, which finally taught him to grow up as a grown man. I love this movie"
10,The best movie ever...,"A masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the storytelling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)

The '70s were the best years for Hollywood."
4,"Unfinished unclear, can't believe this is top250","Basically you see messy things like killings, distrust, disappointment, suspicious people and stories, sudden things, and it does not seem like it has ending, neither positive nor negative. Ending is like beginning, except that this time it is his son. Very negative and long. Not worth watching! Maybe good for older audience, as movie is old too. Old times, no devices, cars, or anything new I got used to."
9,Great Movie,"OSM movie all time biggest movie of mine. I think no movie can be compared to this one.I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
10,A real masterpiece!,"The Godfather is a real masterpiece directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay, which is written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is just perfect. All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema."
10,perfect.,"The Godfather (1972) is more than just a film - it is the greatest masterpiece in cinematic history and the best thing I have ever seen. Every scene is perfection, every character unforgettable. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone delivers one of the most iconic performances of all time, while Al Pacino undergoes the most gripping character transformation in film history. The atmosphere, the music, the dialogue - everything is timeless and unmatched. This movie is not just a classic; it is the pinnacle of filmmaking. A true masterpiece that will never be surpassed.

It is not just a film - it's an experience that redefines what cinema can be.

10/10."
10,10,My absolute favorite movie. I could watch it over and over again.
10,Will never get old,"It doesn't matter how many years go by or how many times you watch it, this will always be one of those 10 out of 10 master pieces that will never get old."
7,"I mean, it's good?","This was a classic, and a very good film. It felt like the end game of the sopranos (just not done as well). I do not agree with everyone that says this is the greatest movie of all time (people also say citizen kane, or Shawshank is the greatest movie of all time), I just didn't enjoy the movie. The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing, which is overly slow. I still love this movie! I think it's funny that marlan brando put cotton balls in his cheeks for this role. This movie was fine."
2,I don't get it,"I've got a masters in Criminology, and have studied filmography, and I just don't get it. This isn't a great movie. The only thing that could make it a classic is the quality of the actors that were hired - and while the actors themselves can and have made quality movies, this one just doesn't do it for me. Brando didn't impress me in the least in this movie.

And as for the portrayal of organized crime - nothing personal, but if you find it attractive to honor men who not just break the law but flout the laws of civilization, then more power to you. Crime and criminals aren't glamorous - they're a sore on the backside of humanity that should be expunged."
10,Great,"Awesome directing, acting, and energy. This is a classic that will remain a classic forever. The entire collection is amazing and highly appreciated."
10,Definitely a great movie to watch.,"This movie, especially the whole series was great. The whole thing about the process of how they work. Also the hierarchy and the story is amazing. How they focus on having each person have their jobs to do. How each actor gives an amazing performance. How they try to take control of each families territory. Having to come together for something series. Especially how they focus on family and being organized. They definitely put a lot of work on this film and the others. Each one comes around 3 hours long but they are definitely worth watching. This movie and the others gave me the urge to watch any other mafia movie that comes out."
10,The Epitome of Cinematic Perfection,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of the best films in history, and definitely the most iconic. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as its lead characters, it is much more than just a mafia film. It delves deep into society and family. It explores the corruption of government, the power the mafia had at the time, and doesn't hold back to portray the brutal life of the Corleone family. It tells a tragic story of how the well-mannered Michael Corleone turns into a cold-blooded murderer and eventually a kingpin. Throughout its long runtime, it gives you no time to rest, throwing twist after twist, and by the time credits start rolling, you will be rooted to your seat, your jaw wide open. Its storytelling is flawless, its characters are multi-layered and you care about them, especially Vito and Michael, who are essentially bad individuals. This is more than a movie, it is an epic, a journey, an observation of how great men descent into the world of crime. If you have not seen this yet, do so right now. You will never be able to look at other films the same way ever again."
10,Best seen on the big screen with no interruptions,"Strongly recommend seeing on the big screen again. The little nuances, sounds and the subtleties that come out on the big screen and the continuity just reminds you just how great this movie is. Or better yet, just how much you were missing watching this on a DVD or worse, TV."
10,The GREATEST movie ever <),"you will learn a lot from this movie about life, love, revenge, growing up, power, friendship & the most important of course Family :)) the relationship between Micheal and his father it's alone need another movie.. how Micheal character complicity changed but he still the same, what could revenge and anger achieved when they exits in smart person.

-It's not personal, it's just business. -I don't like violence, i'm businessman blood is a big expense. -Revenge is a dish best served cold -i'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse -Never hate your enemies, it effect your judgment. -Great men not born great, they grow great. the quotes in this film are endless..

it's a life guide movie not just another Hollywood movie."
10,The Godfather trilogy was a highly successful film,"Especially for his first film which won a myriad of awards such as best film at the Academy Award and Golden Globe in 1973, and Marlon Brando who won best actor thanks to his acting as the Godfather."
10,CLASSIC,"The ultimate classic of all classic movies. From the directing to the all star acting, supporting cast, and crew. This will forever be a classic and I mean the entire collection. Awesome!"
7,"a good watch, but not exactly the most thrilling movie ever","Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching.

7/10 definitely a classic, just don't expect and edge of your seat action flick."
2,Why??,"This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can't even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time.

From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don's friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy? Why do they kill all the time at all? And where is the police I was wondering all the film. Lots and lots of murders, no police. Hm. It's nothing more than a bad 70's Mafia-trash-film."
10,The Definition Of A Movie (The Godfather),"There is only one movie, one movie that stands out in my mind when I think cinema. It Is...The Godfather. Its The Movie you can watch many times and still find something new you didin't notice your previous viewings. Its the movie where you can learn more about the characters every moment of the film. Its the movie that shows the true 1940's mafia. It is the definition of a movie.

Whether its the astonishing script, the incredible cast, and the amazing acting, you'll find something you'll like in this movie. Even if you hated this movie and disposes it, you can always say 1 thing you liked about it, at least 1 thing. As for the acting, Marlon Brando does one of the most memorable performances in the history of film-making. He plays the role of Vito Corleone, the head of one of the five families in New York City. He has 3 influential and historical actors as his son's. Michael being Al Pacino's part, plays his son, a young boy who just returned from world war II, not wanting anything to do with the family. Second, being the infamous James Caan, playing the hot headed Sonny, wanting to take over the family business when vito passes. Then There is Fredo, the poor, dimwitted, fredo, played by John Cazale.

Along with the cast is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the adopted son into the family, with irish blood at heart. Diane Keaton also does a fantastic job as a young woman dating Michael, not knowing what to expect.

The Movie provides something everyone will enjoy, if its the violence you like, you have a lot of it. If its intriguing storyline, bada bing...you have it. Or if you just want to see a nice cast, and one of the best movies ever made....You have it. There is no doubt that this movie will remain in your head after you see it, and its spawned many fans from all over the world. Its a tearjerker, a noir, a love story, and a movie about the mafia. As I have said before, It is the definition of a Movie.

A 12/10 rating A++++"
10,"Excellent, but Sequel is even better.","Without doubt, The Godfather is an excellent movie. The acting, script, mood, music, cinematography and an indefinable haunting quality, all make for one of the finest movies ever made.

However, I believe that the Godfather 2 is an even greater film. In fact, I consider it to be the best film I have ever seen. The last poignant moment of the movie with Michael Corleone in reflective mood, is in my opinion, one of the classic scenes in cinematic history. That one scene has always remained with me and I always associate it with this movie. I was pleased to see that this scene was also included in the most memorable moments in movie history at a recent Academy Awards ceremony."
10,All Time Favorite !,This movie is my favorite all the times.I have seen its all three parts repeatedly.
10,One of the Greatest stories ever told!,"What could I possibly say that has not been said about the Godfather that has not already been said because there has not been a better film. There has been comparable films in my opinion but it is in that elite class. No other movie could excite me thinking about it, like this one, The character studies were amazing, Some of the greatest characters ever. The direction,score was Amazing. Al Pacino secured his place in history thanks to this movie, a Perfect 10, whoever said this movie was bad, I don't see how anyone could respect their opinions about anything."
10,"A masterpiece! A cinematic achievement not matched, nor bettered!","The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was ""The Godfather"". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance!

The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the ""family business"". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical!

Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance ""low-key"". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a cliché ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!

Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire!

Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" and ""It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business"". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar!

The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone!

10/10"
6,"It doesn't seem to suit me very well, and I don't understand it very well","In the second part of the godfather, the old godfather went to kill the hooligans who forced them to pay protection money on a religious holiday, and the process can be described as extremely calm and cold-blooded. When I got home, I hugged my little son and said, ""Michael, Daddy loves you very much.""

All admit that the second part is more or no less than the first. Because this book repeatedly compares the difference between these two fathers and sons. The old godfather was forced by life to join the gang, but he was very sober, one of his purposes was for the family, and the other was as mentioned in the first part, he continued to show favor to unrelated people, and used this as a hedge to keep himself from being completely limited to darkness.

Michael is different, ambitious, wants to climb up, and will do anything to do it, and in the end Kai also leaves him, and his subordinates are also dissatisfied, and his brother is against him and betrays him. And, of course, there is the adversary, who, because he ruthlessly swept away all obstacles in his way and killed the Jew's friend, the Jew designed him. In the end, as always, he killed his elder brother and purged all those who stood in his way, those who betrayed him, including Jews, subordinates, his brother, and apparently the Pope.

When people reach this point, they are betrayed and divorced. So in the third part, he ended up very tragically, lost his daughter, and died in loneliness.

His father was different, he was hunted down by the mafia in his hometown when he was a teenager and fled to the United States to live at the bottom. Later, he did a little illegal business and was forced to pay protection money by hooligans. Then he went to assassinate the scoundrel. Three shots were fired, the first shot knocked down the hooligan, the second shot prevented the hooligan from counterattacking, and then the second shot in the head to ensure that the hooligan died. Unusually calm, methodical, and a masterpiece, but unfortunately there is no way out. Later, he used gentlemanly language to threaten a landlord not to increase the rent of the widow tenant."
5,A slow movie held up by nostalgia,"Honestly this movie is quite mid, its not bad but also not this ""best movie of all time ever"" that people say it is, my conclusion for that is that people just regurgitate what they've heard their nostalgic parents say to seem mature or intelligent.. The pacing in the movie itself is quite stagnant and unengaging after the first thirty or fourty minutes (and this movie goes on for 2 more hours)

I have attempted to watch it on two separate occasions but didn't find anything particularly interesting or captivating in the plot. This is not the problem of the talented actors or cinematography, because those were alright."
10,My #4 favorite film of all time (including part 2),"What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.

The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far.

Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family."
10,Masterpiece Of The Godfather,What Can I Say ??? Is There a Word Who Realy Can Explain About This Greatest Masterpiece
10,Great movie but better the second time around.,"I had heard so much hype surrounding the Godfather movies but I had never seen them. I finally decided to sit down and watch the Godfather. Maybe my expectations were way too high before I watched it because everyone was regarding this as the greatest movie ever made. When I sat down to watch it, during the first hour I was bored out of my mind. It put me to sleep and I cut it off and decided to watch it later. A few days later I decided to watch the rest of the movie and started to realize the movie's greatness.

If you get past the first hour the movie is highly entertaining with great dialog and great acting. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in American History in my opinion.

Watching the movie the second time made me realize that this is probably one of he greatest movies ever. The character development is excellent and you understand that more upon the second viewing.

In summary, if you haven't seen this movie don't expect to be blown away the first time watching. Let the movie develop and when the movie ends you will want to watch it again from the beginning to understand everything that happened. After that you would be hard pressed to deny this movie as one of the greatest."

10,The Godfather (1972) - A Cinematic Offer You Can't Refuse,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather isn't just a film it's an experience, a masterpiece of storytelling that elevates the crime genre into Shakespearean tragedy. Following the Corleone family's rise and struggle to maintain power, the film is both intimate and epic, anchored by Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformative arc as Michael.

The screenplay is razor-sharp, blending family loyalty, power struggles, and moral decay with poetic precision. Every frame feels deliberate, with Gordon Willis's moody cinematography setting a tone that's both elegant and foreboding. The haunting score by Nino Rota is the final cherry on top, cementing The Godfather as a cultural phenomenon.

It's not just a gangster movie it's a masterclass in filmmaking, with characters and quotes that have seeped into pop culture like an offer none of us could ever refuse. A timeless classic."
10,masterpiece,"Best movie in the world. It could be called the best movie ever. Although years have passed, no better has been done..."
7,There are just better movies,This one is good but not a 10/10 (at least for me) It's to slow paced just is too long for what is actually happening And after this movie I just feel exhausted it feels like work and not entertainment Maybe it was a revelation back then but if you watch this in your 20s for the first time you may be dissapoited sorry
5,Not the God of films,"I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill."
10,Best Movie in the history,God father is the one of the best outstanding movie i have ever seen
10,good film,This is a very good film. Just wanted to watch something and this film popped out nowhere. Gonna watch the other 2 film when iam free lol. Maybe iam left behind not knowing this film.
10,superb movie,"This film captivates audiences by immersing them in an underworld that exists right under our noses. Coppola skillfully places us in the midst of a society created by and for criminals, where cold-blooded murderers and seemingly honorable men coexist. The film delves into the Corleone family, led by Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando. Don Vito, while occupying a unique position on the edge of this world, struggles to reconcile his moral principles with the reality of his surroundings. One particularly memorable scene takes place during his daughter's wedding, where his associate, Luca Brasi, rehearses a speech to be delivered to the Don. This scene showcases a humorous and endearing interaction between the two characters, evoking unexpected sympathy for these mobsters. It is worth noting that Lenny Montana, who played Luca Brasi, was an actual former mob hit-man, adding an extra layer of authenticity to his performance."
10,Pilgrimage of movies on 50th Anniversary,"#1 movie of all time. Absolute Absolute Best.

Watched the 50th anniversary edition on a super screen and walked away (again!!) astonished.

Superlative craft in every aspect of movie making.

Only thought was to go home and watch the next two editions.

Pilgrimage of movies starts with Godfather!!"
10,Timeless epic!,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as one of the greatest films ever made. What sets The Godfather apart is its meticulous storytelling and rich character development. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic, exuding a calm yet menacing presence that captures the essence of a powerful mafia don. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael Corleone into a ruthless leader is nothing short of brilliant, showcasing a complex and tragic character arc. Every scene is meticulously crafted, every line of dialogue carries weight, and every performance is memorable. The film's pacing, structure, and attention to detail make it a masterclass in filmmaking.

In conclusion, this movie is more than just a crime drama; it is an epic tale of family, power, and the dark consequences of ambition. It remains a benchmark in the history of cinema, with its influence still felt in films today."
5,yeah,"It's considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got tits and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women.

It would be obvious how paper-thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didn't propel it into something approaching three- dimensionality. I think I prefer Goodfellas because it deconstructs everything this movie is, and is a much more natural, interesting movie in the process."
10,Extraordinary Masterpiece,"A francis ford copolla classic that takes me to different worlds every time I watch it, and deserves 10 points from me with its shooting techniques and fascinating atmosphere. I wish I was in my twenties when this film was shot and I could watch this movie in the cinema."
10,a must watch,"Just watch it, if you don't like it then whatever, but worth a watch. I don't feel like explaining why."
10,A Wonderful Movie,"This film is truly epic, develops the characters in an amazing way, especially to Don Corleone, that he does in the film as a superior to all, with more knowledge and intelligence, based on their sense of friendship and favors. I love this kind of movies in which the protagonists or antagonists are complex beings, with ambitious and colossal ideas, and that not anyone could do. The conclusions of every act and decision that Don Corleone, or of his son, are amazing, doing all to the big, I consider at all of one of the best movies that I see in all my life, and I will never forgot the sound-track and the landscape, that is the final complement that does the movie unforgettable."
10,Amazing movie,"Best Movie Ever. Since the first time i saw it, i did not expect how this film would grow on me, now everytime it's on tv or somewhere else i need to watch it again. I never get tired of it."
10,A gem above the rest,This movie is hands down the best movie ever produced. The story that you see and the story that you don't see are both exciting and powerful. While action packed and emotional this movie will never fail to entertain me even I'd I watch it on repeat for a year I will always love it.
10,A timeless masterpiece,One of the best movies in history. The level of attachment to the characters is unique and like no other movie
1,"Thankfully, I saw the Sopranos first","I also saw Godthumb first. Both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable. I actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies. But The Godfather...I just don't get why so many people say this is a great movie. Perhaps it's to be cool and one of the crowd? I was bored.

Yes, there are some powerful scenes. Yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story, as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies. Yes, it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start.

The story is even interesting so that I might be moved to read the book. However, I found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow.

I'm glad I finally saw this and found out it doesn't really glorify the mafia because I was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices. I'm glad I finally saw it so I could say I did.

But I won't be watching it again. I hear #2 is the best...it has to be."
10,Emotion,"I read someone's comment saying that the movie lacked emotion. Now, I don't agree at all, I love the movie and wouldn't dare to criticise it like that. But after giving it some good thought, I can see what he or she meant with that comment. And it can be easily helped! Watch the other two as well! If you watch the three movies, preferably with no more than a day between them, you WILL feel emotion. It's a long story about people and if you allow yourself to feel for these people, when you get to know them, than you can't be left untouched. At least I personally can't imagine anyone not being touched. The story's so good, the acting is amazing, the movie is incredibly well made and the music is beautiful. So please, people, if you hated the first one, give it another try! Watch it again and watch the others as well. You'll thank me later :) ..."
9,Masterpiece,"This movie was amazing. I've always wanted to watch it and I thought it wasn't my kind of movie at first since I'm more of a romance or thriller kind of person, but I was so wrong. It catches your attention from the beginning till the end. It surprised me, made me smile and also made me feel sad. The performances made by all the actors were amazing, the cinematography was outstanding as well but most importantly the writing, pacing and music were all magnificent, clever and carefully studied to make this movie stand out. I am italian so maybe this is a reason I enjoyed it even more, especially in the parts in which they talked italian, though I'm not from Sicily so sometimes I didn't get the dialect.. finally, this movie made me fall in love with Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's acting skills. It gives you everything and relaxes you while keeping you entertained, so that 3 hours will easily go by. Thank you! I'll definetely watch the other 2 movies."
10,LOVE,"One of the best movies of all time, so much talent behind and in front of the camera!"
10,Unforgettable Classic Movie,"What a Classic! Fantastic cinematography, all actors so talented ,they really make each character so remarkable. It is a must see movie , any time, no doubt about it! The story itself brings all the drama to a especial level , family, love, loyalty ,betrayal. Every scene was crafted to perfection when it comes to tell the story back in the previous decades , the 1940's till the 200's., including the locations, the outfits... All aspects of the movie are truly a great reference when it comes to acting. What an incredible saga! The music contributed to the movie to be an unforgettable one. Simply love watching it from time to time!"
10,Simply Awesome Movie,"It is hard to believe that it was made in 1972. This movie has everything perfect. Storyline, Plot, Twists everything just magnificent. Best movie of all time. Acting of every actor is awesome. Although it has some graphic scenes, this movie is worth the time. I have watched all three parts. Italian- American culture is shown beautifully. It also shows the beauty of Italian culture. Each and every character in this movie is different and unique which makes this movie entertaining and enjoyable with simple storyline. In conclusion, beat movie of all time. The Godfather cannot be compared to any other movie."
10,Fabulous,"Fabulous, it's talking about the orgnized crimes, it processed this in the most dramatic way!"
10,the best,"This is without a doubt the best film ever made (at least that I have seen) not only because all of the graphic violence in it is used sparingly yet compels because it is edited to be kept realistic, but also because not a single scene is dumb or pointless."
10,"Cinema, what has become epochal","""The Godfather"" - 3 Oscars, including for the Best film, the cast, which became legendary, the images imitated by followers. This film marked an entire era of gangster cinema fashion.

Francis Ford Coppola's film lasts almost 3 hours. Yes, it is long, in places it seems that it is drawn out, but this is due to the fact that the film was released more than 45 years ago. Then it was not fashionable and necessary to show constant action on the screen, the scenes were long. However, this, in my opinion, helped to show the life of the main characters more detailed, to feel their characters, to better understand their motivation.

There are two key figures in the film. And they are played by iconic actors. Marlon Brando masterfully tries on the mantle of the main mafia, who enjoys indisputable authority. This is felt in every frame, in every scene where there is a hero Don Vito Corleone. He solves issues, gives advice, is responsible for the whole family. Brando manages this image very well, you believe him, you associate him with Don Corleone for a long time.

Al Pacino plays Brando's son named Michael. And from the very first frames you realize that he chose a different fate. He's going the other way. A valiant soldier, a loyal son whose fate turns out to be different than he planned. And the character changes throughout the film. Coppola demonstrates this perfectly, and Pacino helps him by revealing himself in every scene. This is a wonderful work of an actor who got used to the role.

The rest of the cast is decent, but they all take their place in the picture, allowing Brando and Pacino to be the center of attention.

The painting perfectly conveys the spirit of the time. Gang wars, underground business, family troubles, death. All this is closely intertwined with the plot, perfectly placed in the frame, immersing the viewer in the atmosphere of an action movie.

I like the picture. There are no beautifully staged shootouts, fights, which is typical for today's Hollywood. This movie is a classic. The colors are faded, the deaths of people look much more realistic. It's as if you understand that this is not a movie, but the decisive truth, if you find yourself in that terrible world. After all, the mafia and its wars are not the beauty that you expect to see, even if it is gangster. This is a horror that you should not get into, because the result is likely to be death: yours and your loved ones. Is it necessary?

The soundtrack is also beautiful. The main musical theme is recognized always and everywhere and does not age even after almost 50 years. This is the test of time.

Coppola's film is ultimatum, beautiful and cruel at the same time, it shows the world of gangsters without embellishment, makes you think about the terrible times of gang wars. But he also makes it clear that the family is a very important place, so to speak. A family is a home, it is a motivator, it is a fortress in which there are necessarily difficult milestones.

Coppola's work is an excellent film adaptation of Puzo's book, which is a must-see for everyone in due time. Classics are immortal.

10 out of 10."
6,Meh,"Title says it all. yo. This movie is so boring. If you actually decide to watch this piece of **** you should contemplate purchasing a pair of noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Seriously. I'm being super serious you guys. This movie is super annoying. Like seriously, remember that scene in Airplane where the women literally dies from boredom? That will be you son if you don't listen to me and decide to watch this movie. I'm trying to do you guys a favor. Would I really write all this sh*t if I didn't care about your well being? Also, by the way, if you pause at exactly 50:42 and scream ""For the glory of Satan"" you will get one million dollars. No kidding. Screw Peter Pan. That kid is so annoying. Like this movie."
3,I don't get why it's supposed to be so good.,"""The Godfather"" left me somewhat dissatisfied, as its deliberate pacing and extended dialogue tended to drag, making it a rather laborious cinematic journey.

While the intricate plot held promise, the delivery lacked the dynamic elements I expected from a movie hailed as a classic. The characters, although richly developed, seemed to progress at a sluggish pace, leaving me wanting more depth and connection.

The film's overall tone, while undoubtedly well-crafted, failed to fully engage me, contributing to an overall sense of detachment. Despite its reputation, ""The Godfather"" fell short of meeting my personal expectations, ultimately resulting in a somewhat disappointing viewing experience."
10,No Brainer: Top Film,"One of the best films ever, The Godfather is such a great gangster drama and representation of cinema."
10,all time favorite,"""The Godfather"" (1972) is the best gangster film ever made. It has a dope storyline with compelling twists and turns. Marlon Brando nails it as Vito Corleone, bringing a powerful and unforgettable performance. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is top-notch, and the entire cast delivers. It's a classic that perfectly blends family drama and crime, making it a must-watch. The cinematography and score are also exceptional, enhancing the film's intense atmosphere. This movie isn't just about violence; it's a deep exploration of loyalty, power, and betrayal. Truly a timeless masterpiece. - Melvin Bulock Jr."
10,My most favorite movie ever. watch many times.,My most favorite movie ever. watch many times. shear with many friends. actors did great job in this movie.
10,A Masterpiece of Cinema,"The Godfather is often hailed as one of the greatest films ever made, and for good reason. This epic crime drama delves into the world of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan led by the enigmatic Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).

What Makes It So Special?

Complex Characters: The film masterfully explores the intricacies of the Corleone family, presenting them as both ruthless criminals and flawed human beings. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito is a standout, but Al Pacino's transformation into Michael Corleone is equally compelling.

Epic Storytelling: The Godfather is a sprawling saga that spans generations, blending family drama, crime, and political intrigue into a captivating narrative.

Iconic Scenes: From the horse's head in the bed to the baptism sequence, the film is filled with unforgettable moments that have become ingrained in popular culture.

Themes of Power and Family: The movie delves into profound themes about the nature of power, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of family ties.

A Lasting Impact The Godfather's influence extends far beyond its initial release. It has inspired countless films and TV shows, and its characters and dialogue have become part of the cultural lexicon.

If you haven't seen it, it's a must-watch. And if you have, it's definitely worth revisiting."
10,Wow,A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
7,A Wonderful Masterpiece The Godfather,"The Godfather has set the boundaries off all crime drama films that have ever been shown to people around the world. No one, will ever go beyond this film, it is truly magnificent. The film shows how the Corleone crime family want revenge on the men that tried to destroy them and there old beloved Don. Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando can been seen as some greatest acting that has ever been placed inside Hollywood. The famous line ""I'll make him an offer he cant refuse"" will always be rembered.

Brando plays a character that is a family man, who wants to keep his family safe from the underwold. As well as to get out of the family business. He man who never wanted his sons to go join him, but yet he could do nothing about it. He is man of respect, a man who knows when the right time is, no matter what the situatuion is. He is the Godafther. When he was nealry killed by the drug baron called Sollozzo, he knew that his time as Don was up. He knew that there would be war, bloodshed,and that he could do nothung until he was ready again. His oldest son who was hot headed, angary, but a wonderful tactican like a general could never run this family. His second son Fredo was not man enough to to do his job. He youngest son though, the person who killed Sollozzo, was a calm, thoughtfull, ruthless man, and would be the person to take over the family business. Even to his displeasure, that he never wanted this to happen to his son at all, he knew it was the right thing to help bring back the weakened Corleone Crime Family, into where they belong. The king of the American Mafia Underworld, and the only way to do it is to destroy the five familes of New York."
4,"If you're old, it's great","You may have bought into the hype and rightly so, for being made in 1971 it's pretty solid. The story if halfassed and the acting is mediocre. The voice and over the top Vito Corleone is funny in a sad way. This movie could have easily been cut down to an hour and a half and nothing would have gone awry. You could have guessed everything before it happened, very predictable. I just feel bad for the people saying it's the greatest movie e ver made. Maybe top 100 but I doubt it. Only older people who were blown away at the time by something entertaining still clutch at this boring waste of time."
10,a movie from lifes flow,"I think this movie is part of real life That can be a story for people to tell among friends A story in which there is excitement, advice, pride and honor."
8,"""The Offer"" TV series compelled me to finally watch ""The Godfather""","Now I love movies in general, but somehow the so-called masterpiece ""The Godfather"" from 1972 has not appealed to me enough to sit through the darkly-lit, three-hour running time. However, I hear great things about ""The Offer"" which is about the making of ""The Godfather,"" so I decide to invest ten minutes of my time to see what this series is about. It is indeed a well-made show, with a good story, and I end up watching all episodes. So now in 2023 I just have to watch ""The Godfather."" I can see why this movie would be considered a classic for its time. It has interesting, brooding shots, cast with powerhouse actors, some not yet famous at the time but have since become huge celebrities in their own right. I do have issues with the movie's slow pace, some campy acting from supporting actors, like a couple of mafia sidekicks and the father of the bride in Sicily, awkward fade transitions between scenes, and some rather disjointed turn of events. But all of that is forgiven now that I have discovered the gem that is Al Pacino. I have watched a few of his later movies when he is already considered a legendary actor, but nothing has tickled my fancy until seeing him as a young, very handsome Pacino in ""The Godfather,"" who can convey a million emotions just from his piercing thoughtful gaze. ""The Offer"" is correct; you cannot take your eyes off Pacino as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather,"" even as you witness his gradual moral deterioration. For this, I give this ""classic"" 8 stars in 2023."
10,Crime On A Canvas,"After a very long time feeling bored of series and boring movies I was scrolling through a list of top 100 films I came across Godfather as amongst the top , but as an Indian with less interest in foreign films I was alone one day and started watching on an evening , I don't remember when it finished, I just made coffee and started again and by the night time I was stunned by such a beautiful film i saw , it was like a stunning display of everything actors acting like real life dons, Marlin Brando wooooh just out of the world, Cinematography seen like never before , in fact cinematic experience was as some magician putting his best paintings, the last scene depicting Baptisation and how the other things happened in the background shows true mettle of the director.

The movie takes you into a world of Corrolones and you are just waiting with bated breath as to what happens next .

Hats off to everyone who has been a part of this saga.

Advice: Watch at all costs , any time and feel lucky."
10,Excellent,"Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the ""Godfather"". I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film."
10,The epic film of film industry,"A must watch for all film enthusiasts and lovers. The acting, story, the direction it's extraordinary and the movie is released in 1972 that's remarkable."
10,10/10,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, That have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating."
7,One of the most overrated movies on IMDb,"This movie is probably the most overrated movies on IMDb, if not the most overrated. People on here are looking for too much out of movies and they aren't looking to judge them off of the right things. The movie was shot beautifully, the storyline is pretty interesting, but the movie is long, and dryly drags on and on. TO me the definition of a great movie is a movie that gets my different emotions running, whether it makes me laugh, cry, gets me excited etc. etc., this movie did nothing,I just sat there, I watched the movie, then I thought to myself, this movie is what people consider to be the best movie of all time. THe Best? H*** No, the best movie of all time should make my emotions run in everyway. I'm not saying its a bad movie, but its just not my idea of grade ""A"" entertainment. Definitely not number 1, before you bash me, just think about it."
1,A vastly over rated movie,"Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to ""Goodfella's"" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Godfather"" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the ""Gladiator"" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies.

""The Godfather"" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create."
9,A timeless classic!,"This film was way ahead of it's time, even to this day it's still the pinnacle of a masterpiece. Every single element of this is amazing. The cast, the acting, the writing, the settings, the directing... despite it being quite a long film, whereas I am known to be distracted more easily the longer a film is; this film made me hooked on it until the very last second. I just absolutely love the story too, such a well crafted Italian gangster film all about ""la familia"".. if you haven't seen this film yet what are you doing?? Watch it right now!!"
10,Perfect..!,My favorite movie of all-time! every single scene is a myth.. perfect cast and a remarkable story..! once I watched the first movie I couldn't stop till I finished the triology
10,Perfect,"It took me a while to fully appreciate it but The Godfather is a perfect movie. The story is epic, the acting is incredible, the cinematography, locations, costumes and soundtrack are all stunning. It definitely deserves to be as highly rated as it is. The movie also hasn't dated one bit, it's a timeless masterpiece. I recently watched the tv show The Offer (which is also great) about the making of the movie. That helped me to appreciate all of the finer details. This film really is legendary. This is one of those time where the stars aligned to allow something truly magical to be created. Unfortunately I doubt that a movie this good will ever be made again. It's a perfect movie."

10,My favorite movie.,I constantly review it. Great acting. Excellent direction.
9,Al Pacino Best Movies,At first i tough this movie will be a boring one. but after watching it ... it give me a gosebump... the storyline so good .. it makes me know how cruel the world back then
7,Its ovverated,"Few people are not aware of the existence of this film. At least because of private mentions, references and parodies, almost everyone knows that there is such a movie and approximately what it is about. However, if you read the short description of the picture or don't watch the movie very carefully, you might get the impression that this is just an ordinary movie about gangsters. I'll be brief. Although the film is a classic, it is NOT worthy of the title of a masterpiece. What masterpiece is it when the film is just stupidly stretched for more than 2 hours thanks to the dialogues, the plot is about nothing at all. I watched it only because of the young Pacino, and then on rewind."
1,Crap,"The Godfather is crap...it's a long movie about nothing. I would rather die than watch that crap again...notice crap is written more than a few times? That's because, this is what this movie is...CRAP! The acting is bad, the sets are bad. Overall this is junk. How in the world it's number one on the top 250 is beyond me. You people must have nothing better to do than to watch a movie where people get killed off because they opened their mouths or voiced their thoughts. I can watch that on the news. I hate this movie so much that my roommates are watching it right now, and I have my CD player on as loud as it will go, because I hate this movie! So in closing...The Godfather, all of them, are crap!"
9,Great movie with enduring influence on cinema and stereotypes,"I honestly can't understand those who voted one star for this movie: probably they're trying to counter-balance the great number of 9 and 10 given by many viewers. This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a ""famiglia"" with that kind of activities. This movie is the ""standard"" for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts. I don't know if this movie deserves to be #1 of all times but surely it's the best movie of the genre I've ever seen."
10,Perfect,"The perfect movie. Wish they could make some more like this! The perfection achieved in story, the drama and tension and stakes and the unbelievable performances by the entire cast, from top to bottom, add up to a theatrical experience, journey really, that achieves the potential we all hope for when we go to the movies. Amazing work that more than stands the test of time. I wonder if film producers and studios and directors today might take a cue from the film making process that was in place for this film. The freedom that Coppola had to put together his creative team, including many unknown actors in lead roles, even Brando at the time was considered un-hirable - was so critical to the success of the film. And yet today studios and producers think filling up their movies with ""names"" is the key to good film making, or film selling rather. But isn't film selling predicated upon having a good film to sell? So why not let the filmmakers fulfill their vision with the right characters, not the right names. We just need look back to films like this to see that part of what made them so great was the ability to fill them with actors that we could really believe were the characters they were playing. Not movie stars dressing up to sell tickets. It's just not the same out there anymore."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece of Cinema,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the crime genre. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it delivers a gripping narrative of power, loyalty, and family, centered around the Corleone dynasty. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, while Al Pacino's transformation from Michael, the reluctant son, to a ruthless leader is mesmerizing. The screenplay, haunting score, and cinematography create an unforgettable experience. Every scene is crafted with perfection, making it one of the greatest films ever made. A must-watch for any cinephile, The Godfather stands as an enduring classic in film history."
9,An outstanding look at the mobster hierarchy,"Francis Ford Coppola manages to execute one of the finest pieces of American cinema with the first of his three part saga, The Godfather.

From the dialogue to the acting, this film excels in painting a gritty, realistic depiction of the mobster hierarchy, with one of the greatest pieces of acting in cinematic history with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone.

This film has already stood the test of time and is deservedly ranked as one of the greatest films of all time. A true masterpiece.

I urge you if you have not yet checked out this film, what are you waiting for? It's a true hallmark of cinematic excellence and is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion."
10,The God Father review. 10 out of 10!,"Phenomenal! One of the best movies ever made. Great acting! music, screenplay! Great directing. I can't express my feelings with just words. One of Hollywood's greatest films. It may take a many viewings to fully comprehend the film. I wasn't ready for what this movie had in store for me. This movie will pull you in each time you watch it. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story is great, the characters are very carefully chosen. Al Pacino's performance is very good.. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films ever. A piece of art which will live in the hearts of many, This film is a brilliant mob movie, that everyone should watch. Everyone I know loves this film. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give give great performances in their finest movie ever. The amount of work put in The Godfather is just amazing! I can feel each character's emotion in this movie. I give it 10 out of 10"
10,Reality,"The movie just mirrors the difficulties of gathering and handling power. Stabilizing your current level is probably one of the hardest things you can do, and it gives off the vibe that you should rise and open your eyes."
10,The Godfather Is Still The Greatest Movie Of All Time,"The Godfather since 1972, has been called the greatest movie of all time. Nothing is perfect in life, but The Godfather gives a new meaning to the word perfection"
7,The Godfather was a very compelling film to watch though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time,"After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s."
1,Wouldn't you fall a sleep?,"Now I know this movie is the national pride of America, but I can't help it, it's a blown up, too long, stupid movie. Now you can say oh he's sixteen, he does know anything about movies, well you're wrong!"
10,This movie set the standard for mafia movies...,"Simply put, this movie is the oracle, answer key, the blue print, for all mafia films. There has never been a better mob movie, and there never will. Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.

I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released. I'd heard about it, but VCRs weren't quite common household items back then. I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium. So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.

Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see. They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead. The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.

This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom. To try to convey how great this film is in words is almost silly. It has to be seen."
10,Perfection,"There's a reason this film continues to top the charts as being the best film ever made. Even for it's time, the writing, acting and direction were great. I often forget when this film was made as I'm watching it as the piece is timeless.

If you're into a stark, gritty and poignant mafia crime series, The Godfather is for you. (Surely you've been living under a rock if you haven't seen it by now?!) Al Pacino, James Caan and of course, Marlon Brando do stellar jobs under the direction of the eminent director Francis Ford Coppola. I think I've watched this a hundred times. No mafia film has managed to beat it!"
10,One of the best movies of all time,"I'll start off by saying, as the title says that this is most certainly one of the best movies I ever watched. The movie is fun to watch, what's most important and it's not just for certain parts of the movie, but the whole movie all the way through from the beginning to the end is interesting and unpredictable. This is something that today's movies lack, and what the movies from the past always had which made them great. Story of the movie if fascinating allowing us to see what the real ""mobster world"", underground world to be precise looked in the 1960's, 1970's as many scenes in the movie show us. All in all this is one hell of a movie and I'd suggested to everyone to watch."
9,The Best,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years.
9,A memorable film,"Vito Kliman: As an old generation godfather, Vito is the leader of the family and plays a vital role in the growth of everyone. In the opening study, he easily helps the Italian civilians around him solve problems. He teaches his godson Johnny to value his family and face problems like a man. He teaches Sonny to care more about his family and not to show his family's thoughts. He teaches Fred to participate more in family affairs. He has strong ability to solve problems and looks at the world with a long-term perspective. Although Vito is engaged in the gang industry, he still maintains his conscience and never participates in drugs. He clearly understands that if he participates in drug trafficking, all the forces behind him will draw a line with him. When Mike was in exile and Sonny was assassinated, he chose to meet with the heads of the five major families, giving up some of his interests in exchange for the other party's retaliation, and at the same time let Mike return to the country to take charge of the overall situation. This was the best solution at the time, retreating to advance and preserving the strength of the family. After that, the seriously injured old godfather Vito began to go behind the scenes and handed over the family business to Mike."
10,"A Behemoth of Modern Cinema, Still Potent After Fifty Years","The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc.

It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance of a great novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work.

Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppetmaster married to the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling."
10,Be sure to give this movie the respect it deserves,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWIl hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.

There's no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It's not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There's no way I can list them all.

I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That's 'The Godfather'. It's still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
6,"By directing ""The Godfather"", American director Francis Ford Coppola has given viewers a unique opportunity of discussing Italian values in an American setting.","When it comes to a discussion about the popularity of American cinema, it can be stated that there is hardly any American film as famous as ""The Godfather""-a film which has caught the attention of cinema admirers all over the world. While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in ""The Godfather"" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams."
10,Simply A Masterpiece,"""The Godfather is a truly Godfather of all mob movie i've ever watch, fills with powerful and outstanding perfomance by all the cast, again added with Marlon Brando oscar winning perfomance that really proofing the reason why The Godfather was a Masterpiece"""
9,Classic,One of the greatest films of all time. MUST Watch for all generations.
10,The Definitive Film - A Timeless Masterpiece,"For me, The Godfather isn't just a masterfully crafted gangster film - it transcends genres and redefines cinema itself. It's a powerful family saga rooted in loyalty, tradition, and betrayal. It's also a rich period piece that captures the era with authenticity, and a deeply compelling character study that explores the human condition with nuance. Every frame feels deliberate, every line of dialogue iconic. The performances are unforgettable, the score haunting, and Coppola's direction flawless. This film doesn't just entertain - it educates, influences, and inspires. This isn't just a movie - it's the definitive film. 10/10."
9,Color Grading is spectacular,"Color Grading is spectacular.

Liked the way the story is told!

Good Narrative and not boring at all!

It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately."
9,"One word, 'Perfect'!","This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in ""The Godfather""."
7,It's all business,"For mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for pleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made."
10,Best,Men must watch! The Shawshank Redemption and Godfather are like two sides of a man. Freedom and constraint are actually the same thing.
10,Amazing,Amazing Djdjsjdjdd Dndhjdjxjx Djxjxjxjx Dxhjxnx Atate of art Dhdjdhdj
10,A wonder craft and an absolute masterpiece,"Such a complex story, beautifully executed and each and every characters done their job remarkably well. Well acted, well directed, well scripted- basically anything good you can say about a movie can relate to The Godfather. What makes this film so great is how it develops such a complex character (Michael). He starts out as a war hero, reluctant to head his father's crime empire. Then his father is attacked and just barely survives causing Michael to kill the two men responsible. He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending. Well actually I could go on and on about the baptism scene and the last 5 minutes, so just watch the clips on YouTube (or watch the entire movie). This is my all time favorite film. The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars."
10,Best,"Love this movie and all of the GF movies It is indeed the most classic film history, each shot, each line, is so delicate and rich in meaning. People should spend more time watching this movie."
10,Title: A Timeless Masterpiece - The Godfather,"Title: A Timeless Masterpiece - The Godfather

""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a cinematic gem that continues to stand the test of time. This iconic film not only redefined the crime genre but also set a new standard for storytelling and character development in the world of cinema.

The story revolves around the Corleone family, led by the enigmatic patriarch, Vito Corleone, portrayed brilliantly by Marlon Brando. Brando's performance is nothing short of legendary, as he effortlessly embodies the complex character of the mafia boss with a sense of authority and vulnerability that is unparalleled.

Al Pacino, in one of his career-defining roles, plays Michael Corleone, the youngest son who becomes entangled in the family's criminal empire. Watching his transformation from an innocent young man to a ruthless and calculating mobster is both captivating and chilling.

The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, all deliver exceptional performances that add depth and authenticity to the narrative. The chemistry and dynamics among the characters are palpable, making the audience emotionally invested in their fates.

Coppola's direction is nothing short of perfection, creating an atmosphere that immerses viewers in the world of organized crime. The film's cinematography, with its evocative lighting and meticulous attention to detail, adds to the overall ambiance of tension and power struggles.

The Godfather's screenplay, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, is a masterclass in storytelling. It explores themes of family, loyalty, power, and corruption in a way that transcends its genre. The dialogue is iconic, and many lines from the film have become part of cinematic history.

Nino Rota's hauntingly beautiful score enhances the film's emotional impact, creating a sense of melancholy that lingers long after the credits roll.

In summary, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic treasure that has left an indelible mark on the film industry. It's a must-see for anyone who appreciates storytelling at its finest, masterful performances, and a gripping narrative that explores the depths of human nature. It remains a timeless classic and deserves its place among the greatest films ever made."
9,Old School Movie Making,"You want story? You got it. You want characters? You got it. You want intrigue and movement and music and gala? You got it. This is the template for how movies should be made. You love/hate the people. You feel their lives. You believe and cast aside doubt. You get wrapped up in the thing. This is what a movie is supposed to do.

It's more than a mafia movie, it's a movie about family and loyalty, about love and determination. There is no comic relief, except Luca testing his devotion to the Don, and then tragedy. Yes, a very tragic movie but very well done. There are triumphs. There are falls. All very well mixed and very well done. Excellent work done on the costume and general set work. It draws you into the time and place, as a good movie should. No cheap shots, no pandering. Just very good cinema. Bravo."
10,B3hzad,The best movies of all time💯 That you can Never forget
10,Second Best Movie Ever.,"Where do I begin? The soundtrack, the acting, the pacing, world building, everything! Writing a review for this absolute MASTERPIECE is quite the daunting task. Al Pacino really stood out among the cast members. The way he portrays a man's slip into madness is pure gold. The soundtrack is iconic, catchy, and it fits the movie perfectly. This piece of cinema is only second to The Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa in my book. Not only that, but the writing is perfect! The dialogue is unlike almost anything seen before at the time. You feel as it you get to know the characters of this film in real life! This gets an obvious 10/10 and recommendation from me. You MUST watch this movie! It will change your perspective on the art of cinema."

5,In just one word: Overrated,"Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched ""The Godfather"" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.

This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 2nd greatest movie of all times.

If you have not watched this movie I invite you to do so and judge for yourself. If you have watched it already I would like for you to try and convince me that I am wrong. If you decide to do so, I would appreciate if you did it in a respectful way.

Regards, MANIUIS."
10,Rating from Viewer,"The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WWII Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."
10,the best movie,"This film is without a doubt one of the best films in the world, and after many years, no film has been made with such power in my opinion. Let a film be made with this power again. There is little to say about the beauty of this film."
10,"For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in film making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. If i can give it 11 stars out of 10, i will."
10,Oh my Godfather!,"I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more. If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? (""This is an offer you can't refuse"")"
10,Excelent,"The Grandfather is a masterful exploration of love, honor, and the complexities of human relationships. Directed with poignant sensitivity, this Spanish drama immerses viewers in a deeply emotional narrative that lingers long after the credits roll. Fernando Fernán Gómez delivers a tour de force performance as Don Rodrigo, a proud and aging nobleman who embarks on a quest to uncover the truth about his granddaughters' parentage. The film beautifully juxtaposes the grandeur of aristocratic traditions with the raw vulnerability of familial bonds. Its stunning cinematography captures the sweeping landscapes of Asturias, enhancing the film's evocative atmosphere. José Luis Garci's direction is nuanced, allowing the story to unfold with grace and subtlety, while the screenplay delves into themes of identity, legacy, and forgiveness. The Grandfather is a timeless cinematic gem that speaks to the soul, offering a rich tapestry of emotions that resonate universally. A must-watch for lovers of profound, character-driven storytelling."
6,it was ordinary or even worse than the current movie.,"At that time, the rhythm of the movie was too far from the present, and the climax was not prominent. It seems to be outdated now. At that time, it was a good movie, but it was ordinary or even worse than the current movie."
10,A Masterclass in Filmmaking - Cinema at Its Absolute Peak,"The Godfather isn't just one of the greatest films ever made-it's the very definition of cinematic perfection. From its opening frame to its haunting final scene, it commands your attention with a quiet, almost regal confidence.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful, guiding every scene with deliberate pacing and visual precision. The storytelling is rich, layered, and full of nuance, unfolding like a great novel. Each viewing reveals something new-whether it's a line of dialogue, a glance, or a moral dilemma tucked beneath the surface.

Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone gives one of the most iconic performances in film history-his quiet strength and gravitas define the character. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael to the cold, calculated Don is breathtaking to witness and remains one of the greatest character arcs ever put to screen.

But The Godfather is more than a mob story. It's about family, power, tradition, and the cost of loyalty. The film doesn't glorify violence-it explores the burden and consequence of wielding influence in a corrupt world. Nino Rota's score is hauntingly beautiful, and the cinematography captures both the intimacy and the menace of the Corleone world with a painter's eye.

There's a reason The Godfather is still revered decades later. It's not just a film-it's a legacy. A towering achievement that continues to influence filmmakers and captivate audiences with its complexity, elegance, and sheer storytelling brilliance."
10,Probably the best movie of our lifetime,"Hailed as the best movie ever by most people, and I tend to agree. We probably won't see a movie this perfect in quite some time. Everything from the casting to the execution of the finished film is handled with such precision it is truly astounding.

I guess you are wonder why I wrote ""probably"" in the summary and well, let me tell you this: There is another movie that is if not better at least on the same level as this one. And the movies name? It ends with II.

That Francis Ford Coppola was capable to pull this of at such a young age is awe inspiring and even more so when he did it a second time around. I mean how many movies have a sequel/prequel that is if not as good even better than the first one? Don't worry, you can count I will be right here waiting for you to finish. What did you find? Terminator 2, Lord of the rings 3, Toy Story 3, The Bourne trilogy and The Dark Knight? Well you would be correct and this shows you have rare it is when you think about how many sequels there are."
10,The Godfather,"This movie is a Piece of Art in every aspect. At first it didn't really catch my eye but it didn't take a lot of time for me to realize that this movie is one of the greatest ever made. And yes, it does not have any flaws. Tho some people say it's too long, I really think it's actually too short, if could've watched this for at least another hour. Character building in one movie is actually a very tough thing to do right but in this movie Michael's character development is one of if the the greatest I have ever seen. Now after all of that does The Godfather Deserve a perfect 10? I believe so. If you didn't watch it yet, it's time."
8,A great introduction,"Dom: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse: FAMILY

The trilogy began. It's a story about family, revenge, and heritage in a mafia family in New York. The first half was a bit slow with many scenes that I felt lingered a bit too long. However, I loved Marlon Brando as The Godfather. The way he looked and acted was cool and conveyed a respected boss. I'm not entirely convinced on Al Pacino's character's transition, still in the second half his character became significantly better and more commanding. Of course the ending was awesome and showed the ironic way that Al Pacino's character changed. Overall it's a great first third. 8/10."
10,An American Tradition,"The gangster genre is a American as apple pie. We have had a love affair with mobsters. From James Cagney , Edward G. Robinson etc We Love the Mob. The Godfather is nothing different. It is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. The story is a rags to riches story of a crime family that stared out with nothing then rose to the most powerful crime family. What I love more then that, Is the character development especially with Micheal from a war hero to a cold blooded boss. It is the story of a family that faces challenges from both outside and inside the family.

If you haven't seen this epic. Then please do your self a favor and watch this masterpieces. You won't be sorry.

American as apple pie"
10,Best movie of all time.,This film has made me appreciate being Italian so much more.
7,Good but overrated,"I've been told to watch this movie several times before and i decided to take give it a shot, Well before i seen the movie itself i was told by lots of people like close friends or family that it's one of the best movies of all time if not ""the best movie of all time"" and even on imdb the reviews are really high, Well fast forward i watch the movie and even if i enjoyed it, i might not even find it a top 3 or top 10 in my top favorite movies of all time, and don't get me wrong i watched and understood the movie, and yes for 1972 this movie was revolutionary no doubt, but in current days, there is far more better movies than ""The Godfather"", the movie had a few boring parts, and honestly it was really dragged to be about 3 hours long. Sure maybe if i would of seen this movie back in the day i would probably enjoy it way more than right now but personally for me this movie is massively overrated, by the Metacritic's and the people as well."
2,Overrated,"The Godfather is probably the most overrated movies of all time. I don't see why everyone gives this movie such a high rating. The movie sucks. The movie is just so darn boring and the only reason I kept watching it was because I kept wanting it to get better. I know a movie is not all about action, but come on, who wants to watch a movie that is just all talk and no action. Look at Scarface and The Untouchables, those were good Mafia movies. They both had a great storyline, great acting, and had at least some action. The Godfather is just way to boring and I don't get why it is number on the all time list. Some reviews that didn't like this movie have said many people like this movie because its about the Mafia and its influence. Those people who have said that are absolutely right. The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances were pretty darn good, but the story itself which carry's the movie is just so darn boring and this is without a doubt the most overrated movie ever. I'll stick to the Star Wars Saga instead of the Godfather Trilogy."
8,Amazing,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting."
10,Flawless,"I had always thought this movie was overrated before I had watched it, it truly deserves its rating. I usually get bored when watching dialogue scenes in movies but I didn't even flinch watching this masterpiece, even gave me goosebumps. The music is also playing an important role in making this movie perfect.

Best film I ever watched"
10,An excellent cult piece,A cult that hosts the most beautiful and special scenes in the history of cinema. Perhaps the most impressive film in the history of cinema. It immerses you in the movie with its music and realistic scenes.
10,One of the best films ever made -- beautiful & poetic,"This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.

The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.

The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.

The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.

What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.

5/5. Beautiful. A must watch."
9,Foundation of a gangster role model.,"Story about a man, who is a gangster, and his relationship with family, encounters, businesses and many more. Nevertheless, despite being filmed fairly long ago, the movie is genuinely enjoyable and has very few boring parts."
10,9.2???? I don't think so! PERFECT 10,"Greatest movie of all time no doubt. Perfect 10. Every aspect of this masterpiece is exceptional, starting from the cast and screenplay up until the production."
10,Oh my.,"A very learned friend of mine once said that this was the closest film would ever come to the great operas of European legacy. I'm not inclined to disagree. This was the finest piece of celluloid I've ever encountered, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was tense, beautifully shot, unbelievably acted (Brando is a genius. That's it.), and had everything else going for it that could possibly be good about a film. Oh my."
7,Tad too violent. Not my taste.,"This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance.

Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself.

The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made but too violent and not enough of the evil of man in it."
1,What a load rubbish,"why are people trying to make this film out to be something it is not??!

this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. I mean come on, what a load of tripe.

I could get more enjoyment out of watching The Erotic Witch Project 2 (although I have to admit is pretty classy, the acting is superb, well done girls, you really do look and sound like you are cuming there!!)

Where is all the action the makes a mafia film class, like Goodfella's.

Marlon Brando's acting didn't deserve an oscar, it deserved a slap in the face. Sean Connery's performance as a spaniard in Highlander was more convincing.

Al Pacino's performance is total rubbish. The only good part he can do is a queer and that's in Dog Day afternoon.

As and for the director, Paul Verhoeven did a better job with Showgirls!!

What is wrong with a bit of rape in a film, this is the mafia we are watching on the screen, if they are going to portray what the mafia are really like, then at least show what they do behind closed door.

Very Poor!!!! 1 out of 10!!!"
10,Mob Movies,One of the greatest mob movies ever made. i wish they had 11 stars instead of just 10. i can't wait to see the next one in series.
10,Story Rhyme,"In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone listens to requests in his role as don of the Corleone crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.

Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca ""sleeps with the fishes"". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men.

Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.

Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a ""wartime consigliere""; Vito agrees Hagen should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.

In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her."
10,The quintessential American epic.,"If you admire this film, then you owe it to yourself to read about the making of the film and the odds against which Coppola wrestled to get his vision of how Puzo's story should be filmed on the screen. Doing this will only deepen your respect for both the movie and its makers."
10,Agood film,The God Farther is a good film of unmatched subtley. It is a beautifully crafted gangster film. A master class in film making. It is so well produced. Brandon Pacino and Castellano displayed very good performances. The acting is simply amazing. The writting is phenomenal and breathtaking. The God Father is so incredibly well made and acted that it stands out among the rest of these other amazing. The plot is very unpredictable. It looks stunning. The cinematography is excellent. The lighting is excellent. The acting is absolutely fantastic. The Godfather is quite simply a masterful piece of film making.
10,The Greatest Film of all time Hands Down,"This movie is a timeless classic. I have never seen a movie that matches its excellence nor do I think I ever will. Brando rightfully deserved the Oscar he received for the movie (although his performance in On the Waterfront was better). The AFI list says Citizen Kane is the best movie of all time, but Citizen Kane doesn't come close to reaching the brilliance of the Godfather. Coppola got everything right and made the right choice of choosing the no-name actor Pacino (at the time) for the role as Michael. There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film. The character development is also outstanding. I would extremely recommend this movie to anyone interested in knowing about the great movies of all time. Superb 10/10."
10,"Without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made of all time","I watched this movie at least 200 times. I break down parts. I memorized scenes. I have become obsessed with how men are suppose to act. I am proud to say that my last name is Andolini. I grew up my entire life with people saying, hey do you know that your last name is the same as the godfather? I would say, no he has my last name because I was born before the movie came out and so I had the name first. I am super proud to say that my name is Andolini. I recommend that every human on planet earth watch this movie at least once in their lifetime. If you can't watch it once, then at least take time to read the book which I read 3 times. I have also watched part 2 and 3 several times and I also recommend that each of you watch them as well."
7,My 2 cents,"Well.... I finally got to look at the IMDB voters n°1 movie, the almighty Godfather.

Though it's very far from being an average movie, and I admit I was rather immersed in the story, well... I've seen many better movies than this one, whatever angle I choose: story, screenplay, acting, direction, camera, moral points, invention, anything. I don't get its n°1 rating. I suspect many people praise it out of mere conformism.

Most of Kubrick's movies are better than this, a couple of Polanski's ones too, just to name a few. Other great classics like ""12 angry men"" or ""Network"" easily surpasses ""The Gofdfather"" both artistically and technically by a fair margin, not to mention more courageous, independant works like ""Brazil"" or ""Citizen Kane"".

Excellent movie, for sure, but best movie? Ouch. Its n°1 rating maybe comes from... consensus?

Just my 2 cents..."
1,"Slow, annoying dribble",the worst movie by one of the greatest director. I rented this movie because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed with the garbage i wasted my time on. No Plot to hold on to throughout the movie.
10,Best movie ever made?,"There is no such thing as a perfect movie. But god damn it, the Godfather comes close. The storyline, the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the cinematografie. It's all really good. It is a classic movie I believe everyone should see at least one time in their life. Yes the sit is kinda long, but the time flies by so fast you won't even notice it. And after 3 hours, you still want more."
10,Masterpiece,Speechless What a Movie These movies are handmade with dedication
10,That's too good just amazing.,That's too good just amazing. I just saw this somedays ago.
10,BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the film is a compelling and intricate portrayal of the Corleone crime family and their patriarch, Vito Corleone, played by the iconic Marlon Brando.

At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a story about power, family, and the consequences of a life immersed in organized crime. The film opens with a lavish wedding, setting the stage for a narrative that unfolds over a span of years. Vito Corleone, the head of the family, is a complex character whose presence commands the screen. Brando's performance is nothing short of legendary, and his portrayal of the Godfather earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.

The cinematography by Gordon Willis is a visual feast, with its dark and moody tones perfectly complementing the somber themes of the narrative. The film's iconic score, composed by Nino Rota, adds to the overall atmosphere, creating an indelible cinematic experience.

One of the film's strengths is its character development. The audience witnesses the transformation of Michael Corleone, portrayed by Al Pacino, from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless and strategic leader. Pacino's performance is a tour de force, capturing the internal conflict and moral descent of his character with nuance and intensity.

The supporting cast, including James Caan as the impulsive Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the loyal Tom Hagen, delivers exceptional performances that contribute to the film's depth and authenticity. The ensemble cast, coupled with the screenplay by Coppola and Puzo, creates a narrative tapestry that weaves together the personal and professional lives of the characters.

""The Godfather"" is notable for its meticulous attention to detail. From the costumes to the set design, every element contributes to the film's immersive quality. The use of symbolism, such as the recurring motif of oranges symbolizing impending death, adds layers of meaning to the narrative.

The film explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the consequences of a life steeped in crime. The intricate plot is driven by the characters' relationships and the power struggles within the family and the broader organized crime syndicate. The moral ambiguity of the characters adds complexity to the narrative, forcing the audience to grapple with their own ethical judgments.

Beyond its narrative and technical achievements, ""The Godfather"" has had a profound cultural impact. Phrases like ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" have become iconic, and the film's influence can be seen in countless works that followed. It is a film that transcends its genre, leaving an indelible mark on the history of cinema.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to resonate with audiences decades after its release. With its compelling characters, masterful storytelling, and unforgettable performances, the film stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling through the medium of film. Whether one is a fan of crime dramas or simply appreciates the art of filmmaking, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-watch classic that has earned its place in the pantheon of great cinema."
10,An unmatched classic!,"Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
10,There are films and then there is 'The Godfather'.,"Just like Muhammad Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) the Icon of Indian Cinema is the Pinacle of Acting in the East, 'The Godfather' is the Pinacle of Moviemaking in the West.

1972 was the time, perhaps never to be revised again, when the great actors of the Black and White era transitioned onto color movies. Marlon Brando was one of them and this meant the past, present and future of Hollywood colliding together to create the masterpiece of masterpieces. Alfred Pacino, James Caan and the young director Francis Ford Coppola were the future, in association with the best of the past Marlon Brando. Thus, history was created and 'The Godfather' was made. I don't believe personally that there will be a time again in the future of American of British Cinema when there can be Talent such as this producing content such as this. The 'Good Times' of Film-making are surely behind us as Ideas such as these and Novels such as these have been written, sold and the ideas have been spent.

Like all things Filmmaking may also die oneday, but the story of Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather', which came in the form of a Book from 'Fact to Fiction and then onto Live Screen into a movie, shall live on for ever and ever.

Personally my second best movie of all time, very close to the Sequel 'The Godfather Part 2' which is my most favourite movie till-date."
6,"Film gets its acclaim from being the first big budget anti-hero movie,","To understand this films acclaim you have to understand censorship in America. Wikipedia has a nice section on the 'Production Code'. In short nothing remotely like this film was seen for decades. So when it was released it was a revelation for American movie audiences.

In todays light the film doesn't have the same impact it did back then. The script isn't written that well, the dialogue is labored and dull. Though Brando is amazing and deserved all the accolades he got from the film.

The plot is labored as well and drags in many parts. The enemies of the Corleone family aren't 3-d enough to really be too invested in the power struggles. In fact things don't really seem to be alive as in other mobster films like Goodfellas. The illusion of reality here isn't complete.

Godfather II is by far the tauter and better film, and the best in the series."
1,Whats all the hype about???,"Honesly couldn't see what all the fuss is about. I felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film. Good actors boring story and even worse directing!!! Perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently, and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers, producers, and directors? I don't doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the 'God father' sorely outclassed. It is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay-day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it."
10,The best movie ever.,"Adapted by the book with the same written by ""Mario Puzo"" comes ""The Godfather which is literally acclaimed by the critics as the best movie of all time. It has everything: Drama, Action, Thriller, Mystery and perfect acting. It is the one movie that no one dares to criticize or hate. With stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacio, Robert Duvall it shows you the quality of the movie at the first minutes of it even without even seeing the movie. I have seen ""The Godfather"" 10 to 12 times so far and i don't regret it a bit. Nobody does. If you haven't seen the movie yet(which is rare and unfortunate) you should. You will love it and want to watch it over and over again."
10,CLASSIC,"ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIE MADE. MARLON BRANDO AS THE DON, REMARKABLE WORK !!!!"
10,It's a masterpiece,"It's a truly incredible movie. I always postponed watching it until today. I wish I had watched it before. The movie is so absorbing, both with its script and acting, that you cannot get out of its influence even after the movie ends. One of the best movies of those times. All the emotions and events are handled so beautifully that the performances of the actors are not even a matter of course. A movie that every person should watch before they die. It's a movie that still holds its own despite all these years. I definitely recommend you watch it. The acting, especially of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, was magnificent."
8,An Offer One Can't Refuse,"In the spring of 1968, Paramount Pictures bought Mario Puzo's novel treatment ""The Godfather"" for $12,500 against $75,000 if it became a finished book. When filming of it began three years later, the relatively unknown Francis Ford Coppola was hired to direct. Coppola had just made the box-office failure ""The Rain People"", so Paramount counted on him to be malleable and work for a fairly low salary.

The movie opens in New York City in the late 1940s. The youngest son of a powerful Mafia boss returns from service in the war to find himself slowly being drawn into the family's brutal business.

Unfortunately Coppola and Paramount fell out with each other immediately. The director wanted Marlon Brando as the Mafia boss, but the movie company firmly opposed that choice. They meant that the actor was hopelessly passé and that he also was extremely difficult to work with. But, after being threatened with dismissal several times, Coppola finally got his way and was able to hire Brando.

The row flared up again when Coppola explained that he intended to travel to Sicily to shoot the scenes where Michael Corleone is in Italy. Paramount Pictures responded by contacting veteran director Elia Kazan, asking him to take over the film. The situation didn't calm down until Coppola showed the executives at Paramount some of his beautiful and exciting rushes from the Mediterranean island.

The movie opened in five theaters in the New York area before moving to over 300 theaters nationwide. And it was breaking records everywhere. Later the same year the film overtook the previous all-time box office champion, ""Gone With the Wind"". In 1998, the American Film Institute then named ""The Godfather"" one of the greatest American movies ever made, testifying to its enduring artistic legacy. Francis Ford Coppola's triumph was complete."
10,What a movie,"Magnifico, very magnifico, truly magnifico, always magnifico, never-ending magnifique."
10,The Greatest Film Of All Time,"The masterpiece brought to screen by the fabulous Francis Ford Coppola is nothing more than true perfection. The Godfather is flawless - acting, cinematography, characters, plot... everything builds together perfectly and is simply perfect"
10,It doesn't get any better,"I cannot add anymore superlatives to the previous comments from IMDb subscribers. This movie is the greatest. I read the book twice before seeing the film. The first time for the pure enjoyment of the marvelous storyline & dialogue. The second time to reflect on Vito and Michael Corleone's management abilities. Are they not CEOs?

The movie - it's breathtaking. I own the entire series and watch it whenever time allows. Unfortunately I can rarely afford the six hours necessary to do so."
6,Could have been much better.,"I think the movie was okay, but could have accomplished much more. I, personally, believe that the movie was way too long. There were a number of scenes and shots which served no purpose to the actual story line that could have been edited out and which made parts of it slow and dull. I realize that most of these were made for benefit of the director's artistic vision, but art doesn't always make for good story telling -- just look at 2001."
2,Definition of overrated,"This movie is the definition of overrated, it is incredibly slow moving, half of the movie is dark. very bored after 30 minutes of watching. incredibly overrated."
9,A Thorough Yet Spoiler-Free Review. Read it if you're unsure in any aspect about the movie,"Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars.

The movie is an undoubtable classic. I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie ""Avatar"" (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.

I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now.

Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: ""Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."" They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other.

I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a ""mere"" 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat ""harsh marker,"" and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it.

On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don't like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life."
9,A bit outdated but still one of the best,"As I was about to watch the movie for the first time, almost 50 years after it's realese, I was expecting it to feel old and outdated. I was wrong. I mean, yes, some parts like image quality and visual effects could have been done better today but they're still not bad. Once the movie got started it found a really good pacing. And the fact that the movie felt so real just made it more tense and engaging. Now, I'm no expert in cinematography, but I felt like I was understanding what was happening in each scene and not once was I interupted by an unatrual tempo or poor cuts. I can definitly see why this is considered a classic and why people love it so much. The question is if the movie really deserves the second highest rating on IMDB?"
10,Masters of Psychology,I've watched this trilogy over 100 times now I'm sure - I even have it on my laptop to use as reference when I need some life advice. I've enjoyed this masterpiece as a screenwriter and director and I've borrowed some wisdoms from both Vito and Michael to use when dealing with people. I would give it more than 10 in a rating if I had to. Always going to be the greatest franchises ever created!
9,A Masterclass,"The rythm is amazing, the music is amazing, everything is amazing, it's a masterclass.

One of the first movies that gave transported me in through time and space to submerge me in the universe created by Francis Ford Coppola."
10,Don't take sides against family,"The unique. The only one . The greatest Godfather.

Any man has a lot of lessons to learn from this movie.

First of all, VALUE THE FAMILY. ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man""- says Vito. You should protect your family it's your responsibility and your duty. You must spend time with your family if you want to be a real man. This is one of the lessons Michael learned from his father and used it so much.

Secondly, PLAN EVERYTHING. ""Woman and children can afford to be careless, men can not."" You are the king of your life but to prove it you must be ready to any situation in your life and make sacrifices for your family. You should be thinking about and finding solutions to the problems not the women.

I would write more than 50 lessons that I've learned but there is an offer I can't refuse- I must sleep)

Strongly recommend everyone ( especially men) to watch this movie. It will never be aged."
10,Classic in Crime and Cinema in General,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me.

This movie is based on the novel that was written by Mario Puzo. We are following the Corleone family with the changing of the guard. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) runs the business with his son Sonny (James Caan), lawyer/adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and crew. Michael (Pacino) is home from the war where he was a hero. We see how he gets mixed up with a life he never wanted and becoming the new don.

There's not a lot I can say that is new here. This is a classic. The performances are amazing. Francis Ford Coppola was a master in filmmaking with what he did. This movie is just captivating. Jaime doesn't like long movies and she struggled with breaking from it. This is even an older movie and even set in the 1940s into the 50s. That didn't bother her. It feels authentic and seeing how ruthless these people are while keeping their honor is on another level. This is one of the greatest movies of all time for a reason.

My Rating: 10 out of 10."
10,One of the best films of all time,"How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a ""masterpiece,"" and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.

Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist at work. The Godfather is superb storytelling at its finest.

The story's fluidity has very much to do with the characters. The men of the Corleone family are all distinct and interesting, due to the stellar performances. Of course, the standout here is Marlon Brando as Vito, the aging Patriarch of this crime family. He's simply magnificent whenever he's on screen. That's not to discount the other great performances from the rest of the cast, which includes Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall

The film is technically brilliant as well. The cinematography is stunning, with the more bright colors jumping off the screen, while the blacks set the mood well for darker story moments. The sound is more subtle in its accomplishments, but when you hear the chatter of machine guns, it makes your heart skip a beat.

It's hard to pick my absolute favorite film of all time. I could easily say Lawrence of Arabia, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Lord of the Rings. And I could also easily say The Godfather, as most others have done. But I don't like making such conclusive statements. But don't worry, Godfather. It's not personal. It's strictly business."
6,not bad not great,"The Godfather is not a bad movie. But no way in hell is it one of the Greatest movies of all time. It's not great at all. It's a decent movie, but it is absolutely overrated. It didn't even set any precedents or break new ground or anything. It's just a 3-hour long gangster movie with not interesting stuff happening. OVERRATED!!!!!!!"
2,Nah,Might be a lot of people's favourite but I can't gel with this picture. And I've tried!
10,overrated,This is barely a masterpiece in my opinion. The direction and acting are completely flawless but it lack a lot in writing compared to what people say. Its pretty enjoyable tho ngl.
10,Exclamation!,"I could use the word of our Lord and personal savior but that in reality would only Sully his preciousness, and if i use the name of the creator then it would mean i have no respect for him, when it came down to earth the messing up of humans and power can only boil down to the chosen ones, they can deny it all they want but leaving everything up to time only makes it harder stronger and when the dust finally settles the view becomes clear and then acceptance is paramount, judging by the way it all started no amount of action can rival the potency of the one called the godfather that's the highest ranking human in the world, not to make it personal but that's something to keep an eye out for, in my regards don't toy with the godfather."
9,Just amazing,"The movie is a masterpiece, even in 2021 it still is great. It's the best movie of it's kind that I've ever watched."
8,The original mafia story,"This was the first mafia story I saw. After watching this one, I saw other similar movies which a follow a group of mafia/criminals usually in a New York City setting, but this one still remains as my favorite. The actors are top notch, and the story is brilliant. Now, kiss my left and right cheek!"
3,Overrated,"Maybe it's a generational thing, or I simply just don't get it, but The Godfather was bland and boring from start to finish. The story is hard to follow and lost me several times along the way. I felt emotionally disconnected from the movie and constantly found myself checking how long was left. Although the acting can be very good in some parts, the acting in other parts is downright terrible. It does not live up to the hype, for me."
10,All the time,"This movie is the best movies, I have seen forever. I wish, someone make a series for these collection."
10,Probably the best I've ever seen,"This movie is excellent! Probably the best I've ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I've read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I've seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!"
10,Review The Godfather(1972),"""The Godfather,"" a 1970s film detailing the struggles of a Mafia family in post-World War II New York City, not only changed the face of cinema forever, but also resurrected a genre that had been dead since the Howard Hughes mafia opus ""Scarface"" hit the silver screen in the 1930s.

Directed by then-novice Francis Ford Coppola, future mastermind behind ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Tucker,"" and ""Youth Without Youth,"" ""The Godfather"" not only demonstrates poise and expertise in writing and directing but also in acting. Coppola put his career on the line fighting with power- hungry studio executives to get the actors he felt fit the roles.

Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, youngest son of don Vito Corleone, expertly immerses himself in his character, down to the way he walks and talks, carries himself, and even shoots a gun in the famous ""gun behind the toilet"" assassination scene. Marlon Brando as the elder Corleone gives one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. With Robert Duvall as mild-mannered family consigliere Tom Hagen, and James Caan as the hotheaded Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, every part is well cast and executed to perfection.

Not only are the acting, writing, and directing top-notch, but so is the way the film is carried with great setting, music, and a feeling of authenticity. As Michael travels the picturesque hills of 1940s Sicily, ""Speak Softly Love,"" the famous tune by Nino Rota, transports audiences into the beautiful but deadly world of upper-class criminals. Everything in the film is well timed and well placed, offering the audience a portal into a life filled with twists and turns.

""The Godfather"" also reflects the fact that Coppola collaborated well with Mario Puzo, the author of the novel, and Coppola did a plethora of research to ensure the authenticity of his mobsters. The actors talk, eat, sleep, and kill like real-world criminals, embodying the swagger of high-rolling Italian mobsters. The dialogue flows from their lips as if Al Capone or Jon Gotti said it.

""The Godfather"" will go down in history as one of the most well made films of all time."
10,An Everlasting Classic - The Godfather,"In the timeless classic ""The Godfather,"" the portrayal of Michael's character development is simply breathtaking. Watching Al Pacino's transformation as he delves into the complex psyche of Michael Corleone is an absolute cinematic treat. From the very beginning, we witness a man torn between his desire to lead a respectable life and his family's ties to the underworld. As the narrative unfolds, we are drawn into the magnetic allure of his transformation, and it's almost mesmerizing to see how he evolves into a formidable figure, embracing the power and responsibility that comes with the title of ""Godfather.""

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is equally exceptional, showcasing the brilliance of two acting legends working in perfect harmony. Brando's commanding presence brings gravitas to the character of the family patriarch, and the emotional depth he infuses into Vito's persona is nothing short of extraordinary. The on-screen chemistry between Pacino and Brando elevates the film to unparalleled heights, making their interactions a sheer pleasure to watch.

""The Godfather"" is an epic masterpiece that effortlessly captures the essence of loyalty, power, and the complexities of family dynamics. It's a captivating journey that delves deep into the human psyche, leaving viewers spellbound throughout its three-hour runtime. Surprisingly, the film never feels lengthy, as every scene is meticulously crafted to hold your attention, and you'll find yourself completely engrossed in the compelling storyline, never once glancing at your watch.

Beyond its cinematic brilliance, ""The Godfather"" holds a special place in the hearts of cinephiles for its iconic dialogues, unforgettable scenes, and its ability to etch indelible moments in the annals of film history. The score, the cinematography, and the direction are all masterfully orchestrated, elevating the movie to the pinnacle of cinematic achievement.

If you haven't experienced ""The Godfather"" yet, it's an absolute must-watch for any movie enthusiast. Its influence on cinema and popular culture is undeniable, and even after all these years, its impact remains undiminished. Prepare to be immersed in a world of power, ambition, and family as you witness the saga of the Corleone family unfold before your eyes."
10,one of the best movie,"The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by..

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

.Oh, I adore this movie and all the Godfather films! Every time I watch it (which is a lot), I notice something new. The mix of tragedy and a bit of comedy in the story is so relatable worldwide. Have you ever felt this connected to a movie before?"
10,Praise of the best movie in the history of cinema,"In short, ""Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that examines the complex world of organized crimes and the destructive influence of power. The themes of the family, loyalty and American dream are still resonated with the audience, and its characters and dialogues have become symbolic. Its impact on popular culture and the film industry is undeniable and is still one of the best films made. In addition to critical and commercial success, ""Godfather"" has had a significant cultural impact. This film with its characters, quotes, and scenes that are often inThe popular media is referred to and imitated, it has become a cultural benchmark. The influence of the film can also be seen in many films and television programs, after which they examined similar themes of organized crimes and the acquisition of power. The success of the ""Godfather"" also had two sequels, ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""The Party of Part III"". Although not as admirable as the original film, the sequels are still very popular and examined by the themes and characters introduced. The first film continues. ""The Godfather"" has also been the subject of many academic analysis and studies. The film's exploration of the American dream, the experience of immigrants, and the destructive influence of power have made it a popular topic for discussion. In general, ""Godfather"" is an eternal classic that is still resonating among the audience today. Exploring humanitarian conditions, depicting American dreams and examining the underlying world of criminals has made it a prominent film in American cinema."
9,It's the ultimate groundbreaker in mob films.,"Look at the cast, the director and writer, you know full well this is a film to watch, even if it's about an Italian pizzeria. Joking aside this was The Godfather of so many great mob films of later date. Certain well known Italians and Sicilians didn't like it, probably didn't run the studio and couldn't make an offer they can't refuse.Does romanticize these murderous clans somewhat, but does portray the Sicilian honour, blood feud and just business ideology well . This is a must see."
8,have met others who have seen this movie in other,"Have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people"
1,Boring,"Against the grain. This movie bored the pants off me.

1 hour in and it's still clogging along with all the bad camera anes and awful continuation errors.

Not for me."
10,The Greatest Film Ever,For me the godfather is not just a movie it's a school of life you can learn how to live just after watchin it
10,The only movie that made want to think again about which movie is the greatest ever!!,"I have watched hundred of movies in the last 10 years and my all time favourite is/was ""The shawshank redemption"" i have always seen it as the best movie ever made but after watching ""godfather"" i just don't know anymore which one should be in top for me, one thing i'm sure of right now is that i have 2 favourite best movies instead of one."
8,"Pretty good, but doesn't enough for this century","People around me and IMDB ratings were saying that this movie is one of the best Hollywood movies in history. Despite all the things I've heard, I put off watching the movie for years. I watched hundreds of crime movies and TV series until I watched this movie. I finally watched the movie 50 years after its making. And I can say that the movie is a bit old for today. Because we have watched many productions like this and we are used to many of the details in the movie from different movies and TV series. Of course, this is not the fault of this film, but all that we are familiar with makes the film simple for today's cinema. I don't know how accurate it is to compare the movie with today's movies and evaluate it accordingly. But as today's audience, I can say that the film does not meet some demands. Does that make the movie a bad movie? No. But it's just old."
10,top 5!,"This is the definitive film! One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece."
9,Review,Mafia people so cool they make me wanna buy italian pizza so great so amazing sheesh.
10,Must-Watch movie,"This movie is a good one and its on the must-watch list, seriously, you must watch this :D"
10,Simply the Greatest Film Ever Made,"When watching this film, you really can see and appreciate how many films that has come after take inspiration from this all-time classic. Francis' direction is masterful in every way, Marlon Brando's method acting in this film is immaculate, to me, Brando is Vito Corleone, ""The Don"", ""The Godfather"""
10,Like wine is valuing over the years $$$,"Thank god i didn't die without watching

I strongly recommend you to watch"
7,"A Bit Dated, But Still Engaging","The movie follows the rise (or fall, depending on your perspective) of the son of a crime family boss.

It's a relatively enjoyable long a drawn out movie. Though it moves at a fairly slow pace, it keeps the viewer engaged. I can see why it is so beloved - it features carefully crafted characters with detailed character arcs. However, I don't find it as engaging, or re-watchable, as contemporary films.

It's worth a watch, after all, it's consider on of the pinnacles of movie making, but I can't say it's for everyone."
2,A case of the Emperor's New Clothes,"I don't see what all the fuss is about surrounding this movie. It is long, slow and boring. I'm partial to the odd gangster movie (yeah, I know, this isn't a gangster movie it's a 'family' movie...*yawn*) but have seen far better than this (Carlito's Way, Mean Streets, Scarface to name a few).

Judging by the comments left on IMDB people say this movie is great due to the acting, the cinematography, the direction etc....what about the plot? The characters? Isn't that what makes a good movie? Or are the people who so verbosely extol the virtues of The Godfather all film/media students studying it for their coursework? Do people say this is a great movie because that's what they hear everyone else say?

The Godfather is not a good movie and the emperor is well and truly naked."
10,My Heart!!!,"This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on."
10,Simply The Best Film Of All Time.,"It feels a bit redundant reviewing arguably the greatest and most well-known Hollywood film nearly 50 years after it's release, but I feel like I need to pay homage to this true masterpiece of American cinematic art. This is not simply a movie: this is a cultural touchstone, a landmark of human achievement, and a beautiful work of art realized by one of the few true masters of filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola. THE GODFATHER comes as close to perfection as any film ever could. The directing, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, set design, etc. etc. etc. are all world-class and I've never seen a film do better. Marlon Brando is stunningly brilliant as Vito Corleone, the aging head of a New York crime family; I only wish he had more screen time. Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable and tragic performances ever put to film as Michael Corleone, the reluctant heir to the throne. The supporting cast all give remarkable performances without exception; but Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale stand out the most. This is one you'll want to watch again and again, especially if you love classic auteur filmmaking. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, I both envy and pity you! A true MUST WATCH if there ever was one."
10,a masterpiece.,This is with out a doubt one of the most beautifully made gangster films in history.the acting was simply amazing and mesmerizing .the script and directing were one of the most brilliant and iconic in the film industry! Francis Ford Coppola did a remarkable job.for me it is a 10 out of 10 and a must see.
10,The greatest movie!,One of the best films! Probably the best gangster - mafia drama of all time!
10,Great Film!,"First film that got me into the Gangster category. Would highly recommend anybody to watch this whether you're in film studies or getting into the filmmaking trade or just a general movie nut.

Definite watch!"
10,good,"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.

Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.

Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.

The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy."
10,A timeless classic,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."
4,most overrated trilogy of all time,"I do not understand the big fuss about the Godfather trilogy OK yes the acting is top quality with brilliant performances from marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and even talia Shire is good but the film just drags the whole story is boring and the films just seem to go over the same things over and over again.

I must admit that i am probably not the best person to review the godfather seeing as i don't really like gangster movies i didn't like Goodfellas either although i did like like the untouchables I believe people saying they love the godfather movies is simply because they have heard other people saying how good it is and think that in order to be considered a proper movie lover they have to like the godfathers."
10,AMAZING!!,Cant believe this movie is from 1970s. Its the first time i gave a movie 10/10. Easily this could be the best Movie in the history of Hollywood.
10,Any description is not enough,"Every character seems to be perfectly embedded, everyone has a specified reason to be in the plot and each one brings something substantial that makes us remember them. It is magnificent how the main characters show an ironic mix between honesty, respect, etc. and anger, betrayal and many other facets that makes us ask if they're good or bad people. Beyond a classification for the characters, you gonna love them as they are, and we can understand that there's more than just black and white. Definitely, a movie to watch, no matter how many years from his release, and no, I can't say that is a gangster movie, neither that is a Pacino's Movie, no no, It's more than that, The Godfather could be called for to many people like ""The Movie""."
10,only one word needed.....,Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect
10,The Oxford Dictionary of Acting!,"In Terms of acting in this movie ,this is the highest pinacle for a movie can achieve. Brando, pachino, de niro all are Gods there..i dont know How many times I watch this masterpiece & in future i dont know how many times im gonna watch this. I wish to give 100 stars."
10,MASTERPIECE.,"It's incredible how Coppola directed this film, every shot in this movie is well thought and incredibly executed. The script is basically perfect in every aspect. Cinematography is amazing as well, and the performances are impeccable. And off course the soundtrack is a character on his own. A true masterpiece."
10,Best film ever,"I have no doubt in my mind that this film is crucial to the world of movies and the world in general. Every part was gripping, compelling, and emotional. I cared for every single character and felt for all of them individually. While watching this I placed sections into my brain for each character and started an emotional route for each of them. Even characters who seem as unimportant as Clemenza."
10,Great,Greatest Movie of all time. Always have to stop and watch when it's on.
9,classic Hollywood narrative,"progression of the movie follows the development of the following linear, logical sequenced story lines – Don Corleone is shot; Michael seeks retaliation by shooting Sollozzo and McClusky; The mafia family wars begin with a parallel story of Michael taking refuge in Italy; Don Corleone holds a peace summit between the families; Michael returns to America and becomes the new family Don upon his father's death. This is a standard ""cause and effect"" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals. As a result, the characters' individual actions as well as group interaction help move the movie along."
3,Decide for yourself,"I am glad to see that I am not the only one that just does not 'get' this movie. It is spoken of almost religiously,and it seems that if you dare ask 'why?',your sanity is questioned. Maybe people are overwhelmed by the big-name cast,and have been told so many times what a great movie this is, for so long, and are afraid to say different. All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody. As the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow, the universally-praised movie and this boring and bloated bomb I was seeing turned out to be one and the same. Watch it on a rainy day and decide for yourself if this movie is worthy of all the hype."
10,Best film I've ever seen,"The Godfather is not just a crime drama, but a true masterpiece of cinema that opens up the world of the Corleone mafia family. The film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, captivates with its intense plot, in which Marlon Brando and Al Pacino create unforgettable images. Don Vito Corleone, a wise and cruel leader, and his son Michael, who gradually becomes the new head of the family, face questions of power, morality and family loyalty. With the added weight of Nino Rota's visual aesthetics and music, this film deserves the highest praise and leaves a deep mark on the heart of everyone who watches it."
10,An absolute masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a masterclass in storytelling that delves deep into the intricate dynamics of human nature. At its core, the film brilliantly captures the essence of personal connections and the emotional complexities tied to the concept of family. Through the Corleone saga, it unveils the profound significance of loyalty, bonds, and tradition within the clan, portraying the love and unity that define their existence.

However, beneath this familial façade lies a poignant portrayal of the high costs incurred in the relentless quest for power. The movie astutely demonstrates the contradictions within us, showcasing the dichotomy between the tender love for family and the brutal, self-serving nature that comes with the pursuit of dominance.

The film serves as a mirror reflecting our dualities-our innate desire for closeness and protection juxtaposed against our capacity for ruthless ambition and cruelty. It's a poignant reminder of the intricate balance between love, ambition, and the often harrowing consequences of choices made in the name of power.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" doesn't just narrate a mafia tale; it subtly reveals the intricate web of human emotions and desires, painting a vivid portrait of the human condition where the pursuit of power and the love for family collide, leaving an indelible mark on both the characters and the audience."
10,The Best.,"Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.

Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.

Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency.

The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" or ""I'm a superstitious man!"". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.

The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in ""The Godfather: Part III""). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time.

Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that."
10,Life time film,"Every Film maker has to watch this film, is like A Encylopedia for Film makers and we can say as bibel for film makers, lot of film makers insperied by this film and it became. Dummies for film makers, lot of aspering film makers tries to copy this film and got awards."
10,Best movie ever,"Best movie ever, no matter when you read this, it will still be true. The adaptation of the book to the movie is also the best. Even if you don't like gangster movies you need to watch this classic, you are going to find really good but really good performances, i'm just going to highlight these 4 out of many more, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino (magnificent performances), Robert Duvall (Perfect), Talia Shire (extremely good). Please take the time to watch this movie, it's worth it."
10,Must See,"Why haven't I seen one of the most popular movies of all time? Well I finally did and it didn't disappoint. Despite the length of the movie, I was thoroughly engaged throughout. When a movie has you routing for the bad guys, it demonstrates the impact of an excellent story well executed. The film is so much more than just a gangster movie. It addresses politics, family values, crime and the social norms of the time. I know that I will watch this many more times as well as the Godfather films which follow. Fast paced, excellent acting, great music all combine to make this a must see."
10,Masterpiece,"F.ford capolla's best movie this slow pace and mafia atmosphere slowly draws you in and you go deep into the era al pacino's debut movie.f.ford capolla's best movie, this slow pace and mafia atmosphere slowly draws you in and you go down to the depths of the era al pacino's debut movie and actually it's not that big of a budget movie, but the effect it left on you is very big marlon brando is a great actor."
7,"Not my fav genre, but still enjoyable. The ability to build climax is intense.","Let me start with what I didn't like about it. I know this is a personal preference, but I think the main storyline was too basic for me i.e. X does something to Y. Then Y gets X back. The X's friend gets Y back. And basically repeat that formula. The only thing that really changed was the methods of the attacks. And for this reason, I don't feel the need to watch part 2 / 3. But if you like this genre, then I can see why you would enjoy this movie.

Pros:

+ Great depiction of organised crime during that era. + The ability to build tension was top tier. If I was rating it solely on this, it's probably the most on the edge of my seat that I've been during a movie. + Loved all the characters & character development was great. + Fab acting."
1,Doesn't deserve to be # 1,"I liked this film and all, but does anyone really think this film is better than Lord of the Rings? Come on! It's surprising how many people supposedly ""love"" this film, yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted. A few mumblings here and there do not good acting make. And the attention to detail argument? ""It's so detailed - exactly as that era!"" So what? Lord of the Rings brought to life a FANTASY land, far more challenging than 1940's New York."
10,Simply ........ The Greatest Picture Ever Made.,"This movie is a great honor for all American cinema. Really It's nice an great I've watched this movie 23 times (until now) and I am planing to watch it more. I would like to thank Marlon Brando and Al pacino for this and of course the great director ""Copola"""
10,Classic!,"Of course, a million movies imitate all the superficial aspects, the mafia stuff that's become cliche, but they don't really try to make a movie like THE GODFATHER. Maybe they're just being realistic - not many people could pull off a movie that good. But still. Let's see some striving, people. True greatness has been proven possible. You'll never get it unless you try."
8,Nice movie,Very nive story . The picture cinematography and acting are awesome
10,Obvious But Perfect,"As the title says, this is maybe an obvious statement and boring pick to call my favorite movie of all time, and maybe sometimes it isn't and I say it because it's an easy title that people know. That being said, if it is or if it isn't my favorite, it is still, in my opinion, a perfect film.

Beautifully directed, gorgeous cinematography, excellent set pieces for such a relatively small budget, and expertly acted by some of the greatest to ever act (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton), this is easily Francis Ford Coppolla's magnum opus, even with his fantastic filmography considered."
10,Godfather is to cinema what Bill Gates is to money,"Without the Godfather cinema is missing its backbone. Often heralded as the greatest movie in history, I would not dare disagree. This is the only flawless material this world has ever made. The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it. The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it. The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor. Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down. It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...) Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman). James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both. The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture. This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter. I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home). No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema. Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows such insight and power in leading a family I wouldn't mind letting him run America as President. I own three copies of this movie one for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I recommend this movie for anyone who can breathe. rating/10. PS contact me for any more recommendations on movies, they don't call me the ""tree of knowledge"" for nothing."
9,Such a classic,"The Godfather follows Vito Corleone, the titular character, sinisterly played by Marlon Brando, as he tries to develop his son, Michael (a young and excellent Al Pacino) to become the 'Don' of the Corleone family, albeit in a violent and dangerous, Mafia dominating New York.

The first thing that I noticed was the lighting. I thought that it perfectly encapsulated the two natures of the Corleone family: the terrifying and ruthless yet fiercely family orientated. Corleone is constantly in the shadow, while also being in the light, and it highlights the two sided nature of him.

The next amazing thing about this is the acting. Brando nails the mysteriously dangerous family man who is feared and respected in equal manner. Al Pacino is amazing and nails the arc of war hero, innocent and loved, to Brando's protege, as he turns into the evil Don. The supporting actors of James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall get a good showing, perfectly supporting the two main ones (Al Pacino should have got leading actor!)

The score and editing creates this beautiful Italian set piece, and it's stunning."
10,Flawless Masterpiece,"It took me about three viewings to appreciate this movie, saw it for the first time when i was about 12 years old and found it boring and couldnt understand the plot. Now that i saw it again a bit older i truly understand why this is touted as probably the best film ever.

Nothing i could write hasnt already been written before, but when the only flaw i can find in this movie is a bad overdub - ""I talked to Barzini!"" - then this truly is a cinematic masterpiece."
6,This is amazing.,"I love it, it is well written and produced , not to mention directing, i haven't really been reviewing movies, tv shows etc but i had to start with ""The GodFather"" they should keep making more like this."
3,Peter Griffin: Did not care for The Godfather.,"""It takes forever getting in; you spend like six and a half hours... You know, I can't get through, I've never even finished the movie. I've never seen the ending"" I did not like it. The movie revolves around an old, wealthy man who has too much authority and can't stop yearning for family. But guess what? It'll be the greatest film a 14-year-old boy watched because it's talking about gangsters, mafia, and an Italian old man who talks in a low tone of voice. It's crazy how overrated this movie is. I really thought it was something worth watching. I can't believe how many hours I wasted watching this. And im sorry saying that."
10,One of the best movies in history!,"Unfortunately, today we can no longer watch such quality movies. This film is powerful, a good script, an excellent casting, an excellent acting and a top direction. It's hard to fine a film made so well, it's 29 years old and it's aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mobster movies, he or she will watch the entire movie, the audience is glued to what will happen next as the movie progresses. It's about family, loyalty, greed, relationships and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style makes the film memorable."
10,Cinema at its finest,"This is the movie that I use as a reference for all others to understand the best elements of Film.

When I mention world building, editing, cinematography, directing, atmosphere, characterization and they don't understand, I refer them to the titan of all films. The Godfather is that film.

While not a horror movie, the scene with the horse head in the beginning of the film pushed me to pursuing my passion for horror films.

If you want to begin watching movies as a hobby and really understand the art form, please watch the godfather. It will not dissapoint."
10,A masterpiece of culture and anthropology,"As an Qatari man watching this film for the first time in 2009, it struck me how much I got attached. More than four decades later, and a generation apart, and to a culture so distant from mine, and still this film strikes as one of the most memorable. What makes it that was the question that not only haunted me for years, but also pushed me to study filmmaking and dive intro the subject. This film has not only influenced my awareness and thinking, but ultimately my career and life."
10,The best movie when i ever watched,"The head of the Mafia clan, Vito Corleone, marries off his daughter Connie. Just in time for the wedding, Don Vito's youngest son Michael returns from the war. He has fought heroically and returned home with the firm conviction not to continue his father's business, but to do honest business. Don Corleone and his clan grow richer and more influential every year, which naturally displeases other members of the New York underworld. By cunning manipulations and intrigues, Carleone's enemies first kill one of Vito's men, and then make an attempt on the Don himself. Michael vows to save his father and declares war on the criminal gangs.

Italian by birth, but American by birth, Francis Ford Copolla had already won an Oscar before The Godfather, but as a screenwriter. The first part of the gangster saga brought him real fame, as it won three Oscars upon its release, and was acknowledged as an important film work in the US and throughout the world.

In 1969, a book by Mario Puzo, The Godfather, was published, making a lot of noise and becoming a national bestseller. The book tells the story of the harsh laws in the world of Italian mafiosi, of which many Americans did not even know. Two years later, because of his poverty, Puso sold the screen rights to the 33-year-old Copolla. The young director dared to make such a difficult film by inviting Hollywood icon Marlon Brando to the lead role. The second main role, he asked actors such as Robert De Niro, Martin Sheen and Robert Redford, but Copolla refused all, inviting this role to an unknown actor Al Pacino, whom he noticed in the film ""Panic in Needle Park. The role immediately earned Pacino an Oscar nomination, which, however, he ignored.

The phenomenon of the popularity of such a violent film lies in the fact that Copolla, using tough artistic techniques, showed the true value of family. The director succeeded in revealing the drama of the picture, which lies in the tragedy of a war hero and a very honest young man, Michael, who had to transcend his own beliefs under the pressure of responsibility and family interests. His transformation from a simple boy to a violent mobster is one of the most skilful metamorphoses in world cinema."
10,Low Key Lighting,"As its movie opening Gorden Wills ""Father of Shadows"" created a depth of a shadow which broke my entire cinematography ideas. The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement. Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame. The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people Like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Taliaa and Robert."
10,The Reviewfather,"The Godfather has iconic status and a near-flawless execution. The film is a maste rclass in storytelling, with an ending that is not only memorable but deeply resonant. It maintains a consistent level of excellence throughout, with powerful performances, masterful direction, and a compelling narrative. While the initial pacing may feel slightly slow to some, it effectively sets the stage for the complex and gripping story that unfolds.

The Godfather transcends mere entertainment, becoming a cultural touchstone. Its impact is undeniable, and its influence on cinema is immense. The film's ability to seamlessly blend character development, intricate plotting, and thematic depth makes it an enduring masterpiece. It's a film that needs much attention and rewards repeated viewings, revealing it's many layers. The slight initial pacing aside, it is an incredible film from start to finish."
10,"""The Godfather stands as a pinnacle of cinematic achievement, a masterclass in filmmaking that undoubtedly contends for the title of the best film of all time. In my view, it","Despite its nearly three-hour runtime, there's no need to fret about the duration. The movie effortlessly captures your attention, making time seem to fly by.

The production values are nothing short of extraordinary; the film exudes visual splendor from start to finish, putting many contemporary films to shame despite being roughly half a century old.

The performances by actors like Brandon, Pacino, and Castellano are nothing short of incredible, and there are countless other outstanding portrayals throughout the movie.

For those contemplating a purchase, I highly recommend the Blu-ray version over the DVD. The visual clarity and sharpness make a noticeable difference, enhancing the viewing experience.

The Godfather's profound influence over the years is undeniable, ensuring its everlasting legacy as one of the greatest films ever made. A perfect 10/10 rating is well-deserved."""
10,Probably the greatest mafia movie ever made !!,Coppola and Maria Puzo take you on a journey through the shadiness of the mafia world where we witness the greatest character arcs ever. The cinematography and camera placement of this movie are what makes it different from conventional gangster films.
6,Ok movie,I find this movie a little bit boring at some part but u will enjoy it if u like gangster thriller type movie. A classic movie The acting in this movie is top class I enjoyed this movie basically due to those top class acting
10,Godfather is Amazing,"The Godfather is an absolute ""Classic"". Both Al Pacino and Robert DeNero killed their roles. It's not often we get a movie with such in-depth detail as to why things happened the way they did. Politically correct in every ""bad"" way. I was very young when i first seen this movie and really didn't grasp the exact concept. Now, as an adult, it all makes sense. If anyone reading this has never seen this movie, I recommend you watch it and the others as well. It might even touch home with most that grew up in these neighborhoods and countries during the date allocated within the film. Film makers and anyone acting should make it an occupation to watch this film. Exciting, passionate, dramatic. These are the words I use to best describe my experience with watching this movie. It has also sparked my interest in making my own films. The action and originality of the film makes me want to create a movie just like this one in modern day times. Thank you Godfather, for you have given me much needed inspiration."
10,Acting powerhouse,As a young cinephile I am amazed that there is a movie like this one.Never seen such amazing acting done by Legend Marlon Brando 🔥🔥🔥🔥.My favourite is Al Pacino⚡⚡⚡ as Michael Corleone.That transformation from a simpleton to a beast💟💟💟💟
10,The Van Gogh equivalent of films,"I have had a distinct pleasure to have watched this picture for the first time in a 35mm screen this year in a cinema in London that shows classic films. I refrained from watching it years ago in my teenage years because my ignorant past thought this film was overrated, but honestly, there is no possible word or expression that can describe how wrong I was. The cinematography of this picture is so unheard of and monumental that every frame of this picture looks like something that could be hung as a painting in a museum. The story brings with it elements of something that came out of a Shakespearean Tragedy. I have watched it 7 times or more in a short time, and it takes A LOT to make me watch a film for a second time, let alone 7. It is one of, if not my favorite film of all time. If human civilization were to go extinct, this should be one of the few pieces of art that must survive for future intelligent lifeforms to discover and marvel at."
10,The movie inspired me to become an actor,What a great movie of all times according to me. It's simply a masterpiece. Loved every bit of it. Great performances by marlon brando and al pacino. It was soo real.
9,"James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent","James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.

In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" - in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while ""The Godfather Part II"" was the second - in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her."
9,The best film ever,This film is amazing. I watched in my childhood and still.
7,help with this film,"i just don't get the big deal with this film. i watched it once and it was OK, worth the watch but not the kind of film i think you could watch more than once. i defo don't think it merited a place in the top 10 films of all time. Also, marlon brando...i don't get it. yeah he was a GOOD actor, but i would never consider him a GREAT actor. and his part in this just seemed lacked something that should be there, i just didn't find him memorable. i suppose overall i didn't get this film the way others did, or is it just a case of people think they should like it so they just say that they do? i know that when people talk about it around me i don't voice my true opinion of it in fear of being hung by a mob :P"
5,DEFINITELY the most overrated film ever made!!,"Whenever you hear about this film people always put it on a pedestal about how amazing it is and how its the 'best film ever made' etc and its rated on this site at 9.2. I Honestly cannot rack my brain to come up with an answer to why it's rated so highly in peoples opinion!

The problem with this film is that so many more films have been made of this genre with similar story lines since The Godfather was made...an unfortunately for The Godfather....the others have done it much better (Casino, Goodfella's etc).

It's ridiculously long, I do enjoy a lot of long films, however if it is to be so long then it has to be exciting to keep it going. The Godfather is so so slow paced! And people always go on about Marlon Brando's 'amazing acting' in this...all he done was stick his jaw out a little and mumble all his words! Al Pacino's character is much more interesting. One of the most overrated, boring films I've ever seen...apart from Part II which is even worse! And I've not attempted Part III yet!!!!"
10,Classic.,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made. It combines a superb plot, excellent acting, and top-drawer directing. Brando is great. Pacino is at his best. Add Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire in spectacular performances and you have a terrific ensemble cast. The plot, which combines a mob story with the moving story of a family -their lives, loves, and loyalties- is brilliantly written. It can definitely be called the greatest film ever made."
10,Stands the Test of Time,"I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.

However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.

Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays!"
10,A somewhat reluctant 10 star movie,"This is one of the hardest movies for me to evaluate because parts of it are as good as movies get and in other parts it is almost painfully boring.

The best part of the movie are the two main characters (Vito and Michael). It's tough to imagine any other actors doing as well as Brando and Pacino, especially Pacino in by far his best role and performance. The story is quite good, but mostly serves as a platform to show how impressive these two characters are. The movie starts off great and has a very satisfying ending. It has also aged pretty well. A lot of older movies eventually get done better, but I don't think that's the case with this one. It does feel a bit old and if you aren't used to that, it might not work for you. To be clear, I'm not giving it points for how good it must have been to audiences when it came out, but rather judging it by today's standards. And it holds up in my opinion.

The worst part of the movie is that there is about 40 minutes starting around the midpoint of the movie which is very slow and boring. It's not horrendous or anything, but hardly any other of my 10 star rated movies (about 65 total movies and I've seen a lot of movies) have such an extended boring part to it where very little happens and it's quite uninteresting (to me anyway). This boring section is somewhat useful to the plot and it wouldn't necessarily have been easy to just cut out, but it could have been a lot better. The negative impact of this section is compounded by the fact that it is a very long slow boring section in an otherwise very long slow but interesting, engaging, and excellent movie.

I chose to give this a low end 10 (or 9.5 if such a rating existed here) because there is so much good in it and if you stick with the weaker parts, you do get rewarded in the end."
10,Must Watch Before Leaving World,"The Godfather is an epic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences even today, almost 50 years after its release. The film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic masterpiece that combines a gripping story with stunning performances, beautiful cinematography, and an iconic score.

The movie tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia dynasty in New York City. The patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), is a beloved and respected figure in his community, but also a ruthless crime boss. When Vito is shot and nearly killed, his youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), is forced to take over the family business and navigate the treacherous world of organized crime.

The acting in The Godfather is superb, with Brando and Pacino giving career-defining performances. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, are equally impressive. The film's pacing is deliberate but never slow, building tension and suspense throughout.

What sets The Godfather apart from other gangster films is its attention to detail and its exploration of themes like family, loyalty, and power. The film presents a complex and nuanced portrayal of the Mafia, showing both the glamorous and dangerous aspects of organized crime.

Overall, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the acclaim it has received over the years. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves great movies, and a timeless classic that will continue to entertain and inspire for generations to come."
10,the finest gangster movie ever made. take a bow!,"Ladies and gentlemen, if you have watched The Godfather than you have witnessed what can be called the greatest movie of all time! Simply flawless.

The Godfather aged like fine wine the older it gets the better it is.

Great plot, legendary acting and directing, violent, bold and no gangster movie is as nearly as good as The Godfather. The Italians sure know how to make great gangster movie. This movie proved to everyone that Marlon Brando is the best actor in the world and started the career of the legendary Al Pacino, this says something. If you are starving for greatness watch The Godfather it is nothing less than a masterpiece and if you have seen it, take a bow!"
10,A True Classic.,"We won't know until about twenty years from now whether the films we watch in the nineties are classics. Personally I think only three can justify such a title so far - Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption and La Vita e Bella. Three movies without anything missing. Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2.

People can argue about Jaws and Star Wars but those movies scripts were rubbish. They were all about spectacle. No movie could compare to the quality of the Godfather. In fact the Godfather blows its closest rival out of the water: its closest rival being its sequel.

The Godfather is unlike any movie I ever saw. It begins with a great scene as a man comes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to ask for his help in hurting a guy that has raped his daughter. It is Brando's daughters wedding day and the man who has come to the Godfather never gave Corleone any help before. Brando refuses. It is a brilliant scene introducing us to the world of the Corleone's. We see how ruthless the Godfather can be but we also see his loyalty to his family. It is a scene that will be hard to match in cinema history but Coppola goes on to deliver even more spellbinding scenes. This is the beauty of the Godfather - every single scene is fabulous. No other film can compare to its class.

Some people argue that the Godfather part 2 is better. Not a chance. It's good but it can't compare to this movie."
5,Very Overrated.,"I don't see what so many others see in this movie. It is choppy, the characters are undeveloped, it is not very well acted, and it is boring. If I hadn't read the book, I don't think I could have followed the movie. There is little context in the movie story line without the book to fill in the gaps."
9,The most incredible art piece of the 20th century,One of the most amazing Movies in the history. Very close to the original source and masterfully done. I believe everyone should check out this masterpiece.
10,Simply the best film ever made,"It's kinda hard to describe this movie. After watching it, every other movie that I have seen just feels... I don't know... weak. Inferior. Fake.

The incredible performances in this film make it feel real. The story is awesome. It's tense when it needs to be tense, sad when it needs to be sad, and it makes you feel for the characters, who are written brilliantly.

I can't say anything more than that you need to see this movie. An epic masterpiece. 10/10."
10,All Time Favorite,"One of my favorite movies of all time, from the plot to the characters being played and being Italian it's one of those movies I can watch over and over again. Its a true masterpiece of film, its a movie that you can watch a dozen times and never get board of. A timeless masterpiece, initially I was like The Godfather okay this movie sounds good, once I started watching it and getting the knowledge of the movie it was like wow this has to be no.1 movie in the world it was that good. Again one of my favorite all time movies to ever watch.

The cast in this movie was legendary, this movie has inspired many around the world. One of the best ever.

Now here is the thing watching all 3 of them in one day really gets you thinking about the movie in more detail on what it's about instead of just watching one you half to watch all 3 to really get a clear view of what's going to happen."
10,Masterpiece,Probably the best movie ever made. This kind of movies you can watch over and over without getting bored
10,Godfather is the most memorable film ever; flawless!,"I think that Godfather made deep dents in the film industry. I can confidently say that this movie, with such enthralling and compassionate acting and directing, deserves even more praise that it is already receiving. I have watched this movie more than thirty times and each time is even more enriching. Absolutely no blemish. However, let me remind you that THIS IS NOT A CRIME MOVIE, but of mostly of family principles and character which is so lacking in so many other movies."
10,Godfather Movie Review,"The film has a strong script and has turned it into a masterpiece. Of course, Alpacino's role has given a pleasant taste to this film and made an attractive mafia film that all types should experience the pleasure of watching it once."
10,GREAT MOVIE!,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I wached many time.

Great actors, great director, everything is good in that movie.

Excelent job by Francis Ford Coppola.

I LOVE THIS MOVIE."
10,Trust me when I say this film has earned its reputation,"It's very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it's hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don't usually notice (unless they're really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can't talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn't surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself.

10/10"
7,a good movie,"Good movie but a little boring, but it remains good and good for the actors"
1,Uber-Overrated,"Am I seemingly in a very small minority that find gangster films so soo sooo very dull. I concede that The Godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls I'm not so sure. And when I say not sure I mean Definitely not! I also admit that I'm not a Brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldn't matter if I like Brando or not, I should still like the film right?, and I just don't. My dad is the biggest Brando fan and even he doesn't reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon. In my opinion Carlito's Way or The Untouchables are far superior 'films'of the genre. I think the main problem I have with The Godfather other then the never ending dullness of it, is that it always seems to be saying 'oh look isn't cool to be in the mob, we should all do it'. Of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met, rather then being the message of the film. Not my cup of tea at all I'm afraid."
9,My review,"Til today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
9,A work to remember !,"Classic, contemporary, contemporary, fantastic What to say more about a film that perfectly portrays a system that existed and exists until today?! Congratulations on the job. And watch it, a must for any movie lover."
9,"For me, 'The Godfather' will always be the greatest, dominant Mafia Epic of all time","""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""

Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' is an epic, masterpiece. I mean it IS a forever classic! 'The Godfather' has influenced various films of today, like 'The Departed' and 'Smoking Aces'. Don Vito Corleone represents the true qualities of becoming one of the most established, respected figures in society's minds.

Just after the release of the 1972 epic (which achieved 10 Academy Award Nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster films"" were being judged by the style and look of this one, in particular. The strong performances, the director's unique technique and an excellent script, I believe, all play a role in 'The Godfather's' success worldwide.

Italian-American director, Francis Ford Coppola introduces every major protagonist with a distinctive, complex individuality. Take Corleone for example, played by Marlon Brando. To me personally, he is seen as the most complicated gangster. He is not a killer, nor does he ever mix business with personal issues. He puts family first and doesn't like any weak people. Brando's performance as Don Corleone won him an Oscar and acknowledged him as one of America's greatest film actors.

All men can relate to and understand Corleone's responsibilities of power he permanently has in his family, and how he juggles life as a father figure as well as remaining the boss of his inherited family business.

The film opens on the wedding of Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). The wedding scene is a rather good indication, of how the Don's power expands over everyone in his world, from a regular next door neighbour to a killer. His son Michael (Pacino) has just arrived back from the war, in time to see his sister's wedding. Michael is portrayed as the younger, mature and quiet gentleman of the Corleone family. Given the chance as a husband, to take care of his wife, Kay (Keaton), he doesn't intend to become a part of his family's business and just wants to live a normal life. However, being the oldest in his family, gives Michael more responsibilities, which undoubtedly he can't escape from. Being a part of a big family, running a family business, enables Michael to have more family connections. The mise-en-scene and the cinematography are more dark and realistic. Even the sepia tinged colours are reminiscent of the year it is set in. In most Gangster films, the colour black is portrayed as being highly significant and is effectively manipulated in this case. For example; Corleone's main meeting/office room, where he makes all of his decisions: by having Corleone slightly hidden in pitch-black darkness, Coppola immediately creates that sense of enigma, sinister and chilling characteristics to Brando's Corleone.

Francis Ford Coppola's themes in 'The Godfather' include family responsibilities, father's inheritance, the need to earn respect and the influence of power.

'The Godfather' is ideally aimed at a wide audience, except children of course; frequent Mafia violence for males, to a light-hearted, romantic tale between couples, for the females. The film effectively plays on the psychological mind, human feelings and emotions, which audiences can still accept and relate to, today.

In comparison to other gangster genres, it was the first to introduce the gangster trilogy, with the film's continuous complex narrative that differentiates the importance of family. The representation of Italian ethnicity in 'The Godfather' was also new and innovative, under the conventions of a gangster film.

I enjoyed watching this film in particular as well as the others in the three-part gangster saga. The Corleone family story seems so uninterrupted, if watched all together, in one go. I just love how the dialogue, comes out of the characters' mouths so truthfully. I even feel that as a whole, 'The Godfather' proves to be the greatest trilogy in cinema history.

I'd have to say with pure, 100% Method Acting performances from both Brando and Pacino; this has got to be on the list of must-see films, without a doubt!"
10,An absolute classic,"Wow, Absolutely amazing film. A wonderful cast of actors."
9,Great,"I was born in 2000 so when I hear about old classic movies such as this one, I'm always scared that it will not hold up for a modern audience, that it might be too slow or outdated or etc.

Let me tell you that this movie holds up, even in 2024, when I watched this for the first time. The acting work is phenomenal. Cinemotography is outstanding and the writing is really good as well. As a young person, I can recognize a lot of pop-culture references that I now know to originate from this movie. That was really fun and eye opening to see. The reason that I will not give this a 10 is because of a few moments in this movie where the plot does movie quite slow."
10,A must-watch,"It's everything I ever wanted it to be based on extremely high reviews and my expectation.

The acting is incredible. The character development is fascinating to watch. Twists, turns, amazing dialogue and memorable moments.

It might be long, but not at any point did I think of taking a break. Simply stunning."
10,Excellent Movie,"I just want to say that is the fantastic movie. If you wonder the old New York and mafias you're not going to be regret for watching this film. In the movie they're summarizing Italian's Life in 30's. Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10."
10,Greatest mafia/family film ever,"This movie is incredible. It's the perfect story of family combined with the mafia. This is an amazing story of how power can corrupt and change people, and perfectly blends a balance of family into the mafia life. This movie truly shows the passage of time from the old ways of Vito corleone to the present day ways that do not suit him, and overall help mold the story and craft a beautiful and incredible movie that is one that everyone should see."
10,Marlon Brandon is amazing,The best part of all parts.. I really loved it Marlon Brandon worth the oscar
7,"A good film, but not as good as his reputation","""The Godfather"" is the ultimate mafia movie. It portrays the mafia from within, that is the Corleone family.

The film highlights above all the importance of three (related) concepts: family, food and succession.

The importance of family is typical for societies with a weak state (and certainly no welfare state). This concept is illustrated right at the beginning of the movie. A father whose daughters haven been dishonored by some guys aks Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to take revenge on those boys. Don Corleone is not surprised at all about this request. He is however offended by the fact that the father had first reported the issue to the police (= the state).

In this family driven society business is done in an informal way, not by formal contracts. The ultimate event to make these informal agreements is dinner. The film has numerous memorable dinner scenes. These dinners can be in a restaurant or at home, but when business is done they are always without women. Part of being a mafioso is therefore the ability to prepare a good meal. One would not expect something so emancipated in such a patriarchal environment!

Also the last concept of succession is tightly related to family. Succession is not a matter of ability alone but a matter of both ability and the bond of blood. After the death of Sonny (James Caan) Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) becomes the crown prince. At first he is a an unwilling crown prince, prefering a career in legal businesses. During the scond half of the film however we see him coming to terms with his destiny, even embrace it as a vocation.

In the brilliant last scene Micheal Corleone's wife (Diane Keaton) watches her man while his subordinates kiss his hands. Much to her disgust Michael Corleone is now the Don. After this the door of the room of the men is closed. I don't know if during the making of the Godfather there were already plans for a sequel, but in any case this ending scene is the perfect cliffhanger.

""The Godfather"" was the comeback film of Marlon Brando and the breakthrough of Al Pacino. It is a good film but in my opinion not as good as his reputation."
1,The Truth,"What can I say? I gave this thing a 1 because I honestly have never felt it was all that good. I that saw the average was a 9 at the time I voted and I felt the dissenters should get some representation. Brando isn't all that great in it. I mean the thing is better than the average film (at least I'm supposed to believe that), but 9 out of 10!? No way. Watch different movies. In fact, watch other coppala movies. I personally like 'The Outsiders' and 'The Conversation' better. I find the story to be boring. I also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish. I won't go into detail on this. I will just say the thing left me dry."
10,The Epic Trilogy,"In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a ""real life"" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie. There is no evidence of this custom being mentioned prior to the movie."
10,A great piece of entertainment,"The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family."" Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece."
10,"If not perfect, then as close as a movie can come.","If this movie is not perfect, then it may be as close as a movie can come. The people who made this movie excelled in every facet. The writing, direction, and cinemetography are all superb, and there isn't a bad performance in the film. Coppolla captures the look and feel of New York in the late 1940s, then introduces us to an underworld of his own creation.

The opening scene, the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone, is the longest wedding scene I've seen in any movie and not a moment is wasted. Virtually every character and plot twist that appears later in the movie is introduced here. When the baker mentions to the Don the Italina POW his daughter wants to marry, we never see the boy, yet he shows up at the hospital later in the movie, just before Michael's introduction to McCluskey.

Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is so strong, his presence and his character so dominate the picture, that for twenty years it never occurred to me that the title character was not Vito but Michael. It was not until I was an adult that I realized that the tragic conflicts in the picture were Michael's and not Vito's. Vito's time and world were fading and it was time for him to leave with it. Michael subordinates his personal dreams of achievement outside of the family to serve the family when it needs him. Once he's drawn into the family concerns, he is trapped. As he takes on the responsibilities of family leadership and grows as a man, his options outside the family diminish and he loses the freedom to be the man he had hoped to become.

One of the things movies give us are the images that stay with us. This movie is full of them: Sonny's beating of Carlo, the mass murder interposed with the baptism at the end, a disconsolate Fredo on the curb, Vito in the garden with his grandson, and of course, the horse's head.

This movie gives you something new each time you watch it. Rent it this weekend."
10,Classic.,"The movie is more than worth watching, it is one of the classic movies of the American cinematography. Al Pacino is as always great. And the story, the atmosphere and the spirit of Italian-American neighborhoods, of ""old school"" mafia, ""La Cosa Nostra"", was transferred amazingly great. You shall see lots of interesting stuff about Italian Mafia traditions, about their Code, that used to value back in the days. In my humble opinion, the second part (The Godfather II) is not as good as this one, and you should definitely see at least this. I remember I first heard of this movie from my grandfather. And if he advised the movie, it meant that it's good indeed. This one was not an exception."
10,"The ratings are true, definately #1!","I eventually saw this film as it is widely regarded as one of the best ever made. The hype and the 10/10 ratings ARE true. This is excellent! I saw Godfather 2 first as it deals with the young Vito in part so comes (chronologically) first in the series but part 1 is the best. From Marlon Brandos oscar-winning performance to Al Pacino (the true star) this film is practically perfect. Vitos demise, Michaels rise, the downfall and eventual success of the Corleone family - all perfectly plotted. Any film that can make you care for gangsters has to be doing something right. There are some dubious moral issues, but this is a movie - you watch it to be entertained. Who can forget the horses head scene, Sonnys assassination, even the oft-repeated quotes such as `I`m gonna make him an offer he can`t refuse`... If you haven`t seen this film then watch it. I only wish I had seen this film earlier."
10,Absolutely perfect,"Whether you're an admirer of the genre or not, Mafia films have no better ally than The Godfather in defining what you expect from such a tragic and dramatic subject. This masterpiece doesn't just tell the story of killings and score-settling, it instils in its viewers values and ways of life that are benevolent and just a few steps away from the reasonable and respectable. As well as mixing several generations of absolutely titanic actors, the story behind the madness engendered by the thirst for power and money shows us that without love, family and friends, man will never be happy or fulfilled.

A fine lesson in education and principles, more than a film, a philosophy."
7,Not bad but very overrated,"Film isn't bad, but there are film much better with less ratings. There's no way this is a 9.2. Goodfellas was way better than this."
1,"Violence, Violence and more Violence","A ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes. After about 20 minutes of this tripe I wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them -- for the good of humanity. With few exceptions (Pacino) the acting was also of low caliber. All the money spent on the sets, costumes, and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storyline."
10,The Godfather - A Timeless Masterpiece of Crime Cinema,"The Godfather, directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic gem that has etched its place in history as an unrivaled masterpiece. Released in 1972, this crime epic transcends time and stands as a shining example of exceptional storytelling, brilliant performances, and profound exploration of power, family, and the complexities of the human spirit.

Based on the renowned novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather pulls us into the alluring world of the Corleone crime family. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone anchors the film, supported by an ensemble cast of remarkable actors including Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, who bring these captivating characters to life with unparalleled depth and nuance.

What sets The Godfather apart is its meticulously crafted screenplay. It weaves an intricate tale of intricate relationships, clashing loyalties, and gripping power dynamics. The film explores the consequences of choices made within the realm of organized crime, while delving into themes of loyalty, honor, and the erosion of innocence.

Visually, The Godfather is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography, characterized by its masterful use of shadows and evocative compositions, sets the mood and transports us to the heart of this underworld saga. Coppola's attention to detail in recreating the 1940s and 1950s era, from the costumes to the meticulously designed sets, adds an extra layer of authenticity to the viewing experience.

The film's score, composed by the legendary Nino Rota, has become an integral part of its identity. The haunting melodies, accompanied by the unforgettable theme, further heighten the emotional impact of the story, punctuating moments of tension, tragedy, and triumph.

Beyond its technical brilliance, The Godfather shines in its exploration of complex characters and their moral dilemmas. Each individual is meticulously developed, revealing their vulnerabilities, desires, and internal conflicts. From Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) tragic transformation from an outsider to a reluctant leader, to the inner turmoil of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) torn between loyalty and conscience, the characters resonate deeply and leave an indelible mark.

The Godfather's influence on popular culture is immeasurable. It has shaped the crime genre and inspired countless filmmakers, setting the benchmark for character-driven narratives and gritty storytelling. Its iconic quotes, such as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" have become ingrained in our collective consciousness.

In summary, The Godfather remains an unparalleled cinematic achievement. Its gripping narrative, impeccable performances, and profound examination of power and family dynamics continue to captivate audiences across generations. As a testament to the art of storytelling and the enduring impact of exceptional filmmaking, The Godfather holds its rightful place as a timeless masterpiece in the annals of cinema, one f those movies that makes you become the character, yes I wanted to be a mafia gangster after watching it !"
10,Best Movie!,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.

The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.

""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.

Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.

But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.

The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).

The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.

Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.

Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
10,Greatest movie of all time!,"When this movie came out years ago, I went to the theater to see it 17 times!!! This was a new kinda family! The acting was superb! Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were absolutely outstanding!! And Godfather 3 was also the best movie ever! I have the trilogy set at home! I wasn't crazy about Godfather 2. It wasn't that great to me. It's nothing like seeing the Godfather on the big screen! It's as if you are right there in every scene! I would go to the movie theater today to see it one more time! That's the first time I'd sat that long to watch a movie! It was so worth it! Go to YouTube to see it!"
10,An Incredible Production...,"It is a perfect production in a word, both with its shooting and acting. It is truly incredible that the atmosphere of being able to live in the film, which cannot be made now despite the year it was made, was created in those years. You can learn a lot about life from this movie. If we need to examine the soundtrack of the movie, all the sound arguments in the movie, including the effects, are handled properly. I had goosebumps the first time I heard the music that reminded me of this movie when heard. When we examine the scene shots in detail, it is as if the mimics of Al Pachino, who plays the character of Michael, are watching through his eyes. I invite those who haven't watched it, no matter how old they are, to watch it...."
10,Amazing movie,"This was an amazing movie with a stellar cast all around. The writers did a wonderful job writing the movie. Sl Pacino did an amazing job. Marlon Brando was about to bring himself back into the limelight. What else could be said about this timeless movie? The acting in the movie was great. You had drama, romance, action in it. You had a great story between the father and son where the dad wanted the son to eventually take over the family business while the son wanted out of that life and start anew but eventually he caved after everything that had happened to him I his personal life with his own family."
10,Love movie,"I must have watch this a 1,000 time amazing story and acting"
10,An offer I couldn't refuse,"Ah yes, The Godfather. An absolute classic in the film industry. With such legends as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and so much more.

This movie makes you embrace what it's like to be in the mafia. You feel like you're part of the Corleone family, and what actions they do to stay on top. It immerses the viewer into this sick, twisted world, and actively rooting for criminals to succeed.

On top of that, the movie is also very funny and quotable, most notably the ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" line.

This is a movie everyone should check out due to how engaging it is. There will never be a film quite like this in film history."
9,Must Watch,One of the best trilogy made till date. Despite the slow move of the movie sequences it catches the attention of the viewer. A better way to represent the DON families of that time.
7,Good,"I remember I watched this as a kid. I am thankful for that. This is a great film with a tone reminiscent of other great films. The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off. The cinematography is stark and bare. In the bundle of all that it lacks, I feel that the movie is ignored for its writing. Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go. I suggest this movie to everyone. This is actually a serious movie with a serious message. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. I like this type of film, as it reminds me of German movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. Final rating from me: seven out of ten, almost eight out of ten."
5,"A fairly good mob movie, which delves deep into the murky waters of the crime world.","When I first went on this site, I was so excited what the top movie was I nearly exploded. When I saw that this prestigious position was taken by the Coppola classic, The Godfather, I was like ""Ah, not what I expected, but it seems deserving."" When I actually rented it out in the hope that it would be the best movie ever, I was quite shocked. What I'm trying to say people is DO NOT expect it to be the best movie ever made, because it is far from it. It takes SO MUCH out from the original book that you'll wonder if the book and the movie are written by the same person.

That's not to say this movie is bad, but rather it misses out on so much from one of the greatest books I've ever read. Where is the Adventures of Johnny and Nino!? Where is the vaginal surgery?? Why isn't Doctor Jules in this movie?! Why the hell did they make Tessio insignificant? Why didn't they let you know more about Paulie Gatto?? The only reason you'll want to see this is if you are a mob movie fanatic or so you will understand the 2nd movie more (which by the way is in every respect better). It is a good movie, but there are many flaws such as the acting quality, the way that you must practically smash your windows because your turning the volume up so high to understand what they're saying among other things. Good movie, but not #1."
10,The Godfather: An Unparalleled Masterpiece of Cinema That Has Stood the Test of Time,"The Godfather is a cinematic tour de force that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful mafia clan in 1940s New York City. Marlon Brando's portrayal of the patriarch, Vito Corleone, is iconic and stands as one of the greatest performances in film history. But the entire cast delivers, with Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall turning in powerful performances.

The attention to detail in The Godfather is nothing short of masterful, from the meticulously crafted costumes and sets to the expertly paced and choreographed scenes. The film is not just a gangster epic, but a meditation on family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power. The Godfather's impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, with countless films and TV shows still drawing inspiration from its style and themes.

But what truly sets The Godfather apart is its timeless appeal. Nearly 50 years after its release, the film remains just as captivating and relevant as ever. Its exploration of human nature and the pursuit of power still resonates with audiences today. The Godfather is not just a classic film, but a work of art that will continue to be studied and revered for generations to come."
10,Best Film All Time,"One never knows when one will be bested. Did Citizen Kane anticipate Vito Corleone popping a couple of cotton buds in his cheeks and changing cinema forever? With the possible acceptation of Shawshank, the characters, cinematography, screenplay et al have not been surpassed and it is unlikely they ever will be. If you haven't seen it you're a missing out. It defines the term classic. It is timeless and everlastingly relevant. We'll still be watching this film in six hundred years. It's the Mona Lisa of Movies. The Beethoven of Film."
10,What can you say wrong about this film?,"This is one of my personal favorites right here. I can't say anything wrong about this incredible story about the Italian mafia. The film is so good that it is mostly character driven, which tends to be boring to most, and with the subtle action, a person can hardly tell. I guess it's the unique way the story is being told through the characters, how one man (Michael) must change all his views on life and morals to save his family, becoming a part of something he was trying to run from all his life. At the same time Michael is working for his father's approval, even though they were on different sides of the wall of good and evil in the beginning of the film. I give this film an ""A+"" and a 10 out of 10."
10,The best mafia movie ever,"Yeah. I don't think i have to write more than that actually. I think the most of you already know how good this movie is (or how good these movies are), and what the story is.

It has so much emotion and is depicting that world so compelling, it's hard to explain it without spoilers.

If you like crime movies, watch it. If you like drama, watch it. Do you like suspense and action? Watch it. Do you like music? Watch it.

It's the kind of movie that has everything. The kind of movie that leaves you breathless, that you will never forget.

The only people who shouldn't watch it is the ones that only like modern movies with lots of cgi and big explosions and action from start to finish."
10,A Masterpiece,"As an actor who appreciates the art of storytelling and character development, ""The Godfather"" stands out to me as a masterclass in cinematic excellence. This film is not just a movie; it's an experience that immerses you into the world of the Corleone family, offering a deep dive into the complexities of loyalty, power, and family dynamics.

What struck me most profoundly is Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Brando's performance is a study in subtlety and power, capturing the essence of a man who is both feared and respected. His ability to convey so much emotion through mere expressions and a distinctive voice is something I, as an actor, find profoundly inspiring.

Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone is equally compelling. Watching his journey from a reluctant outsider to the ruthless mafia boss is a portrayal I find both chilling and captivating. Pacino's nuanced performance showcases his incredible range and depth as an actor.

The film's narrative is a rich tapestry of themes and motifs, weaving together stories of betrayal, moral ambiguity, and the pursuit of the American Dream in a way that feels both epic and intensely personal. Coppola's direction is impeccable, creating a slow-burning intensity that builds to a powerful climax. The cinematography, with its use of dark, moody lighting, perfectly complements the film's tone, creating a sense of foreboding that lingers long after the credits roll.

As someone who has a deep appreciation for the craft of acting and storytelling, ""The Godfather"" is more than just a movie; it's an essential piece of cinema that continues to influence and inspire. It's a film that demonstrates the power of cinema to transcend time and culture, remaining as relevant and impactful today as it was upon its release.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's an artistic benchmark that sets a high standard for storytelling and character development. Its impact on the film industry and on actors like myself is immeasurable, making it an enduring classic that continues to resonate with audiences around the world."
7,Powerful and violent,"I thought the film was very powerful, but a tad too violent for me. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny."
2,I really don't understand what people see in this movie,"I just don't get it. Sure the acting in some parts of the movie is good, but honestly, the entire ""angry Italian""-role is probably the easiest character to play. And i really don't get how every other character other then the ""angry Italian"" seems underdeveloped, plain boring and uninteresting.

The only way for you to like this movie is by sympathize with the characters. And sympathizing with the bad guys (since almost every main character is a murderer and a mob member, even the protagonist is a bad guy)is difficult, although not impossible. If the director makes the evil sides of those characters redeemable, then it would be a lot easier for the viewer to sympathize and worry about the protagonist if he/she was in danger. When i however see Michael Corleone in danger in this movie, every time i wish for him to be killed, for i feel nothing for him. Which means that watching this movie was a waste of time.

Although the soundtrack is quite good so instead of a rating of ""1"" The Godfather will receive a ""2"" out of generosity..."
10,From Avoidance to Adoration: My Journey with The Godfather,"This film seems to polarize viewers - you either love it or hate it. That's how I felt about The Godfather initially. To be honest, I avoided watching it for a long time without really knowing why. I assumed people were overhyping it, and I couldn't grasp why Mafia-themed movies received such high praise.

However, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon a game called Mafia II. Intrigued, I gave it a shot, and to my delight, it was fantastic! The writing, soundtrack, and gripping story captivated me. When I shared my excitement with a friend, they pointed out that Mafia drew inspiration from The Godfather, suggesting I might enjoy the film if I liked the game.

Taking their advice, I finally decided to watch The Godfather today, and I'm thrilled that I did. While I understand why some might find it slow-paced, I was mesmerized by the characters' story arcs, particularly Michael Corleone's transformation from a noble figure to a ruthless leader. It was a remarkable journey to witness, making this film one of the greatest I've ever seen. While the entire cast delivered stellar performances, I must say Al Pacino's portrayal stole the spotlight, surpassing even Marlon Brando.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. Ignore the hype and simply immerse yourself in the experience. I'm eager to delve into Parts II and III soon."
9,A memorable movie,"For me, the adopted father trilogy is an example of a full-fledged film of American cinema. A movie that I can watch again and again and enjoy watching it every time. In my opinion, all the actors of this movie played their roles well and created a memorable movie. And the most important thing is Mr. Francis Ford Coppola, who left nothing to be said with his excellent direction.

Whenever my friends ask me to recommend a movie, The Adopted Father is the first movie on my recommendation list. And of course before Seven Samurai.

I congratulate all of them for creating such exciting scenes and such a captivating story."
10,Best,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."
10,The best film ever,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
10,It's the Godfather,It's the Godfather! What more can you say? Possibly the best film ever '\(0_0)/'
10,"listen, whoever comes to you with this barzini meeting, he is the traitor","""keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"", ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""luca brasi sleeps with the fishes"", ""don't over-estimate the power of forgiveness"", ""if anything in this life is certain, if history's taught us anything, its that you can kill anyone"" etc. These words are still in my mind."
10,gold,One of the best movies i have ever seen! 10 stars out of 10
7,This should be the best movie of the era.,"Although rave reviews, but bluntly speaking, the traces of this film era are too obvious. It should be classified as an old-time movie before the watershed of a certain era. The plot, setting, performance, rhythm... Basically all aspects have reached a very high standard with the standard evaluation at the time. But at the same time, it is also greatly limited to the framework of old-time movies. If measured by modern life rhythms and aesthetic habits, the film's plot and rhythm are long and tedious, the performance is deliberate and formal, and the amount of information is not large... In short, it is not good-looking."
5,Great Book... Slightly above average movie (so sad),"The book is awesome, one of the best books ever. Sadly the movie is weak, and fails to portrait the true essence of the characters, what's so great about the book is that you're able to know and understand the background stories, therefore you identify with the characters behavior to the point where you even forget they're mobsters!! however in the movie many minor and irrelevant scenes take too much time, time that could be used to go a little deeper into the characters, and what's even worst is the total disregard to important passages of the book which didn't even make the movie, or if they did, they were over-synthesized. I don't think I'm the only one that really loved the book, but was sadly disappointed by the movie, still is a movie worth watching, but if you really want to enjoy a great story you should read the book!!"
10,A movie I can't refuse!,The best movie of all time. It is the great beginning of the greatest film trilogy of all time. Truly mesmerizing with it's epic directing and stellar cast. It is definitely Hollywood (actually film-making as a whole) at its best. Loved the scenes and the atmosphere. It really deserves all the love it gets.
10,godfather is a nice movie,"There are many classic shots in the movie, which make many scenes classic. For example, in the first camera angle, when Michael is murdered in the restaurant, the camera zooms in and uses medium close-up photography techniques. This focuses people's attention on Michael's facial expression, showing his inner tension and indifference. When he goes to the bathroom, the shaking of the handheld camera adds to the tension.

In the scene of the godfather's baptism, soft lighting is used to show that the church is very grand and sacred, making the whole baptism process very solemn.

In the funeral in the middle, medium and close-up shots were also used to make people look very sad."
10,Francis Ford Coppola made us a movie we can't refuse.,"I've seen some great movies, but the Godfather is more than a movie. The Godfather is more than an epic. The Godfather was years ahead of its time. In fact, if the movie were to be made today, it would STILL be years ahead of its time.

The movie was EXTREMELY long, and the beginning moved a little slow, but there was never a point where I thought to myself the movie was boring. There are a few scenes that take you by surprise, and a lot of plot twists.

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino acted out their parts well. As ruthless as their characters were, as bad as the things they've done, you never cease to hope they get the last laugh.

This movie was so dark, it's as if death was at every corner, and it was. The Godfather was an action movie with a story... a GOOD story. How often do we see those? Try never.

I heard from everybody that this is the greatest movie ever, and my expectations for this movie grew and grew with every comment (I heard millions, and my expectations were already high). I saw the movie, and even with expectations as high as mine were, It was STILL more than what I expected. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I make YOU an offer you can't refuse: go see it."
10,The best movie in the world....,"Strong story ... professional actors .... Directed by smart ...

10,Too Perfect,"You've read all reviews and everything else. It's ridiculous that a 42 year old movie still bests ANY current movie. ""The Godfather"" is simply TOO perfect. The acting. The dialogue, the action, the overall story. People expecting video game action, pleas look elsewhere or go to bed. ""The Godfather"" is simply one of cinema's greatest achievements!"
10,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather""","Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather"" An intricately constructed tapestry of narrative, emotion and the trials of a reluctant gangster."
9,Art in the form of a motion picture,"Clearly a film masterpiece in every sense of the word. Superb filming of each scene. From the moment of the opening line ""I believe in America"" by the desperate for revenge and justice undertaker Bonasera to the closing line ""Don Corleone"" by the loyal capo Clemenza the viewer watches art in the form of a motion picture."
7,A Timeless Classic of Crime and Family,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the crime genre, offering a profound exploration of power, loyalty, and the bonds of family. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film is an epic tale that captivates from its opening scenes to its unforgettable conclusion.

Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone is both powerful and nuanced, embodying the patriarch of a criminal empire with wisdom, ruthlessness, and surprising tenderness. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael Corleone to the cold-blooded successor is masterfully portrayed, marking one of the finest character arcs in film history."
4,Do not keep high expectations from this one,"The only good thing about the movie was its style. It is unique. The second thing was Al Pacino, I mean he just holds everything still while he speaks. REally commendable performance. The opening scene was fantastic""I believe in America"" perfectly lit shot. After that everything is a drag. I get bored by the end of the movie. It has elongated scenes , I mean these so elongated that you can take a nap without missing anything. It was more like a opera kind of movie. So the opera lovers may like this movie but for me it was boring. Go watch it if you kind of love family drama said in a kind of some song and well love to nourish the scenes"
10,Stardom Slot,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that transcends time and genre. Released in 1972, this film adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is a tour de force in storytelling, character development, and cinematography. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone are performances etched into the annals of film history, while the film's exploration of power, loyalty, and the complex dynamics of a crime family continues to captivate audiences across generations. Clocking in at nearly three hours, ""The Godfather"" is a meticulously crafted epic that unfolds with precision, drawing viewers into the Corleone family's world and its intricate power struggles within the organized crime underworld."
10,The Godfather... Not just any movie,"I have one word, this movie is a masterpiece. remains a reference for anyone loves make movies!"
10,Would you like an orange?,"Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. ""I believe in America."" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.

It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.

There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!

At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.

Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc.

There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!

It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an ""eye-level"" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.

The famous ""Mattress Sequence"" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.

It's quite fascinating to recognize how many ""classic"" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.

One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.

The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.

So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).

Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse."
9,A Timeless Cinematic Classic; It's a Crime Masterpiece.,"'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone.

From Marlon Brando's stunning makeover to the incredible acting of almost every member of the cast, Gordon Willis' spectacular cinematography, tight editing, the remarkable background score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), and almost everything else in the movie is quite flawless. No matter how many times you watch it, from the opening scene with Don Vito being asked for a favour at his daughter's wedding, to the final scene with door closing on Don Michael, the new ruthless boss of the Mafia family, the movie's three-hour long runtime captivates you till the very end. It's unlike most other crime movies with too many plot twists, action sequences, etc. The film is quite character-driven. It mainly shows the transformation of the character Michael Corleone, the war hero returning home during his sister Connie's wedding. Michael was the innocent and reluctant one in the family, who always stayed away from the family business. After certain events, he is compelled to take over the business, and it's sad and intriguing at the same time to see this character slowly evolve into something completely different from what Vito, Michael or any of us had expected. Ultimately, it's a movie all about family.

Marlon Brando was not even 50 when he gives his Oscar-winning incredible performance as the head of the Corleone family. Al Pacino, who plays the central character, gets his career launched with this movie, and shows what he's capable of. Other supporting actors like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, etc. - all of them give brilliant performances.

There are so many scenes and dialogues in the movie which are more than memorable: the opening favour scene, the horse head on the studio head's bed, the sequences together showing the planned downfall of the family (including shooting of Don Vito), and especially, the craftily directed baptism scene, during which the family executes a few things to finally rise up.

Nothing can be pinpointed in this movie to be called as flawed; it's an exceptional crime drama. It's an astute adaptation, and the movie stands on its own. But if it had a little more heart, I could have called it a flawless and perfect masterpiece."
10,Perfect,"It's a difficult word to cope with. It's a word that I try to toss around as little as possible. But there's just no other word. The Godfather isn't necessarily my favorite film of all time, it's not necessarily the best film of all time, but it's just that: perfect.

Very few films can make this claim; very few films work on every possible level, on every aspect of the art of cinema, with every line and every shot perfectly placed, none wasted, none too fast, none too slow. The Godfather is a film that takes its time, sometimes moving slowly, but never so slowly that it loses momentum; it's a film that's incredibly rich and full of emotion and symbolism, but it's also very entertaining.

In the music - Nino Rota's score compliments every scene its in, immerses the viewer, never distracting but always a part of the atmosphere, so that whenever you'll hear it a scene from the film will immediately come to mind.

In the editing - it can be very simple at times, and very intense at others - like the baptism scene near the end. It can be slow and tense, it can be calm and euphoric, and it can also be bloody violent.

In the cinematography - the lighting is never coincidental, always complimenting the mood of the scene, the coloring always expressive and always of importance.

In the acting, of course - The Godfather boasts a supergroup of actors, and almost all of them pull their most impressive performance here - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton... this is to the credit of Francis Ford Coppola who drove the actors to these performances as much as the actors themselves.

There is no film better than The Godfather. There may be films that are more complex, more original - The Godfather's tale, beneath the complexity of dozens of characters, is a simple story of family, honesty, morality, loyalty and family... most of all family. Even Part II can be seen as more sophisticated than the first film - but it's not 'better', because unlike The Godfather, Part II has flaws, small as they may be.

If you love movies - watch The Godfather. Whether or not you're interested in crime fiction, watch it. If you just want a good piece of entertainment, watch it too. It's a rare accomplishment - it's a film of quality that may be equaled, but can never be surpassed."
7,Fantastic acting and cinematography,"This movie, about the aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty in postwar New York City who transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant youngest son, brings fantastic qualities when it comes to the acting and the cinematography. Very realistic and stunning! The general life and relationships of the characters felt so real, and the production design was perfect. Can't avoid to mention the action and its practical effects. Very professional! I had a nice time watching this, but my main critic is the pace and the length. It was sometimes bland and boring, because I think there were too many scenes, or some of them too long. Some scenes could have been deleted or shortened without making any major differences on the movie. Anyway, a good movie overall, and therefore recommended!"
1,Overrated,"This has got to be the most overrated movie of all time. When I found out about this infamous movie with a score this high. I was 100% sure I would have a good time. But as you know from the title this wasn't the case. I can understand that some people really like this movie. But for me this movie was just an average movie way too slow paced. And that probably has alot to do with the age of the movie it is after all from 1972. I am aware that if this would be released now it would be alot worse but maybe if they had waited a few years and released it in the 80s it could have been better even though you all think it is perfect. Maybe I am delusional or just too young too experience this ""masterpiece"" as you all call it. After all I have only just turned 18. I would love to have someone explain to me what makes this movie so good otherwise I guess I will just rewatch this in a few years."
10,The drama that portrays some of the history of the 20th century in America,"Many words have been written about ""The Godfather"" since debut in 1972 and no doubt that all words are quite flattering, but always worth a few cents more about this great movie. The work, directed by then newcomer director Coppola, was awarded in the launch year and continued to receiving well-deserved awards, until soon became a landmark of international cinema . With substantial actors and flawless performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the story has traces of a true work of art. Its soundtrack also awarded, is absolutely amazing and remarkable. Who does not hear the chords of the soundtrack by Nino Rota and automatically remember the movie ?

Additionally all, ""The Godfather "" is a portrait of its time period and so it goes on all the other works of the trilogy. The film is built upon a significant historical period, shows not only the role of foreign immigrants and their difficulties in building an identity in America as it is also very thorough in addressing how the Italian mafia was organized for several decades in USA. For this and more, "" The Godfather "" is a film which must be seen, a reference that needs to be seen by all those who love movies and want to understand the social development of the United States at the beginning of the last century."
10,Greatest Movie of all Time,"Yes. It's that good.

This is one of the only films that I can watch, and still notice that detail more with each viewing.

This is one of the only films I've watched that hasn't got one flaw.

This is movie was the greatest film experience i've probably ever had (This and Scorsese's Goodfellas, Taxi Driver & Raging Bull).

These reasons alone should get everyone who hasn't seen it, to see it. - Because you haven't lived until you've seen this film. Al Pacino is absolutely amazing. The greatest thing about the trilogy however, is Michael's eyes. Oh my god, especially in part II. It is amazing. WATCH IT.

10,A Must See...if you still haven't.,"Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children's children...if we're lucky.

I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven't seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino's character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It's just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family.

The fact that this movie is non cliché makes it more enjoyable to watch. It's not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It's so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood.

Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It's not the loudest and most 'vibrant' movie, but that's kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won't like any. No words and reviews can do this movie justice and i believe that unlike some over rated, inflated movies The Godfather actually deserves its big reputation of being a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. without a doubt...10/10"
10,The perfect movie.,"The Godfather is probably the most perfect movie ever made. A strong plot, a unique cast, direction, filming and editing are beyond words, and the music makes you blend in. There are other great movies of course, but some of them lack one or two things mentioned above. It's difficult to match this one. Francis Coppola probably did that with The Godfather Part II (1974), and he may have exceeded himself. The Godfather is such a masterpiece that you can watch it over and over again and you will never be bored but always surprised how wonderful it is. Just to see young Al Pacino change for a college boy to a ruthless mafioso is a miracle of movie-making, even more so than Marlon Brando in the title role, albeit a small one. But the most underrated role and actor in both the Godfather movies is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen."
10,A true masterpiece,"The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad.

The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. A smart thing to let Mario Puzo do the screenplay as he knows all the characters and the story inside and out. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing, but if you just pay attention you'll do fine. The characters and the combination of characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them. The characters are very believable and you get to know them, what kind of persons they are. The story and action is also very good. You get caught up and dragged into another world. The dialog, witch is important to this movie is well written. It's not that typical movie where everyone knows what to say at any time. There are silence and thought-breaks, that makes it all more casual and normal.

The actors are very good. The have settled for nothing less than quality actors in all roles. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando and does a good job and will forever be remembered as Don Carleone. Al Pachino's performance is nothing less than great. The rest of the cast are also very good an delivers a very good performance.

The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is good and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stands out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.

The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that ""this is the 40's"". It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie. Not once do you think ""why don't he just pick up a cell phone?"", because it all seem so realistic and well done.

Nino Rota has made a forever memorable score. It's classic and easy to recognize. It makes a nice, kind of gloomy mood, and fits the rest of the movie perfect. I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there are no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.

There are some special effects in this movies. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but it not that much. What there is is rather good. Some it has a little theatrical look to it and therefor I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it. The fact that they don't literally overkill and focus on this makes the story more serious and much more believable. This movie is no action movie, but 100% drama at it's finest.

The Godfater is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It almost a legend. If you like movies this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it'll destroy you impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!"
7,Good but not great film!,"I saw the film for the very time tonight and while I did enjoy it, I felt it was a bit overrated. There's been so much hype and deconstruction of this film over the last 4 decades, it's hard to approach it with a fresh perspective. Th cinematography was really beautiful and the lighting especially in the indoor scenes really set a glorious mood. I enjoyed the more subtle performances given by Diane Keaton and Al Pacino. A lot of the violence however, seemed gratuitous. The biggest flaw, frankly, was choosing Marlon Brando to play the Don. I love this actor and have enjoyed many of his performances, but this wasn't one of them. I thought he was dreadfully over-acting and ghoulish. It was a gross caricature and how he won ""best actor"" is a mystery to me! All the talk of how he had to ""age"" himself for the character made a mockery of his role with the Kleenex stuffed in his mouth and his put-on gangster voice was just distracting in the end."
1,Best mafia film ever yeah right,Well I've just watched supposedly the best ever mafia film EVER The Godfather well all I can say is WHAT A PILE OF GARBAGE seriously people rank that higher than Goodfellas jog on will ya. I've just lost 175 minutes of my life that I'm never getting back. I'm not watching the second one unless someone pays me a lot of money. What was good about it really apart from the end credits I don't know. The horse head in the bed was sort of cool but other than that it was a load of garbage. If anyone tells you to watch this say you want paying to watch it because it's not worth 5 minutes of your time let alone 3 whole hours.
10,Wow (Good Wow)!,"I really don't know how else to summarize the review of such a perfect movie.

""The Godfather"" is undoubtedly my favorite legitimate, serious attempt at film-making. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction enhances performances from such top-quality actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and more.

It is a violent, tense masterpiece, a movie in the small pantheon with ""Alexander"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (as well as the remainder of its own trilogy) that can hold your attention for three or more hours and never skew boring. If you're still unsure, pay attention to the squibs. Or the brilliantly natural production design. Or Gordon Willis's imaginative cinematography.

Still not convinced? Just listen to this: it's much better than the book. ""The Godfather,"" while very brutal, is probably the greatest American cinematic masterpiece. And if you won't believe this reviewer, believe the people who exalted this film to a 9.1, making it the IMDb's highest-rated film. It is one of few movies on the Top 250 that deserves such a position."
10,"Stanley Kubrick, ""The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made.""","And he wasn't wrong. After recently viewing this masterpiece of American film for the first time it is understood why it has earned such acclaim for so many years. It is hard to put into the words how beautiful and flawless The Godfather really is, all I can say is that it is the most brilliant saga of family, business, and crime ever captured on camera.

One of the greatest qualities about The Godfather is its craft. The craft is impeccable in this film. This must be credited to the fantastic cast (from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino to James Caan and even to Abe Vigoda) and to one of the greatest directors of American cinema: Francis Ford Coppola. No other man could have unraveled such a craftily built epic that The Godfather is and remains today. Coppola and co-screenwriter Mario Puzo (who wrote the novel The Godfather) wrote the greatest screenplay Hollywood has seen. And it is due to the genius of both of these two gentlemen that The Godfather came to be.

Two scenes in the movie that prove the brilliance of this film are the fateful diner sequence and the fantastic ending. Micheal's emotion is so ever present in that scene it is like you are right there with him holding the gun, focused on killing the man that attempted the murder of his father. You are with Micheal. Brilliant Scene. I also love the ending in which the door closes on Kay who has just watched Clemenza kiss the hand of Don Michael Corleone, her husband. Best final scene I have ever witnessed.

In final, I return to my opening remarks and Stanley Kubrick's quote, ""The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made."" To me, this statement is amazing. This came from Kubrick...KUBRICK!...quite possibly the greatest filmmaker that ever lived. That just goes to show how powerful The Godfather is. I love this movie and all who love the art of film-making are in debt to the men and women who gave us this film.

10/10 If you haven't seen it, watch it. And if you have seen it, watch it again."
10,The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.

The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.

The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.

""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.

Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.

But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.

The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).

The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.

Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish- brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.

Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
10,I guess that this movie is an offer we cant refuse,"I hate gangsters movies, but ""The godfather"" is a big exception.

I always listen about ""The godfather"", and i always thought that it could be a lost of time. But, in a Sunday, i watch the film. At the marvelous and surprise ending, i say: I cant believe this movie exist.

""The godfather"" talk about Don Corleone, and his blood. How his family enjoy, and the same time they suffer. Besides a great music, the interpretations are incredible.

The violence is presented around the whole family, as if it a curse. This movie had a lot of good remembers, because is different story, a story of love, revenge, thrills and surprises.

""The godfather"" is interesting because in each take, in each second it takes you to the drama of this family, and you suffer as them.

Definitively, this it is a movie that has certain touch, because the story makes you give curiosity, because we don't know to where arrived this family with this risky business.

*sorry, for bad words... well, if there any"
10,One of my favourite films,"The Godfather recognises the polar opposite to the American dream. It itself represents the ""dark side to the dream"" in a romanticised way using mise-en-scene and costume as well as Coppola's clever use of binary opposition with light and mood.

The Godfather shows some clear morals also, such as the importance of family and patience. Loyalty is key and you find yourself, as with any good gangster film, becoming loyal to the characters, or the family introduced, in this case the Corleone's.

Coppola's time frame is clear from the beginning, it is set with Micheal's army uniform from world war two, which allows a certain amount of historical l context to be conveyed without being explicit.

Violence within this film is both implicit and explicit, you will view violent scenes and also know when violence is being implied. Which only adds to the beauty and the danger of the film.

Many have said this film is slow moving and confusing, however to watch with a careful eye, which is must be viewed with, it displays a complex world to a naive viewer, sympathy is invoked carefully and somehow all crime committed within the film is seemingly justified with careful use of versimilitude."
10,A Definite Must See,"I first watched this movie a few months ago and I loved it. I decided to watch it since I had heard it was one of the best movies ever made. And I now agree with those who said that. I thought that this is one of the best movies as it was well scripted and the characters were strong. Francis Ford Coppola casted some of the best actors for this movie.

The first time I watched it I loved it but I had to watch it a second time as I didn't get what some of it was about. But from the first time I watched this movie I knew it was a masterpiece.

Some people say that is is overrated but in my opinion you could not overrate The Godfather no matter how hard you try. But that is my opinion.

Marlon Brando did an amazing job portraying Don Corleone and he made me want to watch this movie over and over again as he just amazed me with his brilliant acting. Al Pacino gave an astounding performance as Michael Corleone and it is this film that made him my favourite actor. James Caan wowed me as Tom Hagen and his character was one of my favourites in The Godfather.

I loved this film and I could watch it over and over again and not get bored. In my opinion this movie is a definite must see.

I hope this review helped you."
10,The greatest film of the 20th Century,"This film has everything - Great actors at the top of their game, a brilliant and realistic story, a top director, brilliant cinematography, wonderfully evocative post war costumes and cars, brilliant scenes (horses head, restaurant shooting scene, hospital scene etc.) and a score that adds to the film without overpowering it. At first look it would seem to be a film about a family of gangsters, but I think that what it really is is a story of how a good, intelligent man, a war hero, can become a monster by degrees. Godfather II is probably superior but it couldn't have been made without this film. A true masterpiece."
10,The Shakespearean Epic Of The Movie Generation,"How do you define a movie's greatness? For me, it's pretty straightforward; mainly the direction, the script, and the acting. And the Godfather triumphs on every level. Coppola and Puzo have created an epic tale of a powerful mafioso patriarch passing his crown down to his unwilling son, and the shift of power unfolds brilliantly with betrayal, vengeance and tragedy.

Marlon Brando delivers one of the most intensive performances ever seen in film seemingly effortlessly. His calm demeanor carries along a subtly powerful and intimidating presence. Al Pacino is a revelation in his first role in a major film, displaying his range as he moves from the role of a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park, to the reluctant successor of the Don who transforms from the righteous war hero into a ruthless king. James Caan is PERFECT for the hot-headed Sonny, as is Robert Duvall as the intelligent Tom Hagen and John Cazale as the tragic figure of Fredo.

I will run out of superlatives if I continue. Overall, The Godfather is a timeless classic that will always be the epitome of how a truly magnificent epic film should be."
7,Good movie... but I have seen better.,"THE GODFATHER

A long time ago I started to watch these movies and got about an hour into The Godfather and was really bored so I turned it off... until now.

I liked it... but it was long! I'm pretty sure it could have been shrunk down to 2 hours.

There are some really good scenes in this movie. The hits that are made on various people were really well done for it's time. Don't get me wrong, you could see the blood wasn't real, but back when this was made i am pretty sure they didn't have the effects and make up we have now.

The story was really good, but it was a very slow paced movie. It took a while for the movie to get going. There is a lot of dialogue and if you listen to it properly and get into the movie you will enjoy it.

The Corleone family is a family you don't want to mess with. They take no prisoners. If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.

The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.

The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion. But I can understand why this is a classic. This was probably the first big gangster film.

I loved the soundtrack too... the theme to this film is legendary. I have listened to it a lot. Slash plays it on guitar really well at his concerts.

I will give this film a 7 out of 10.

A good movie, but a mission to watch due to the length. I will be watching The Godfather Part II very soon.

1,Boring.,"This movie is about boring and miserable people making others miserable in a boring way. I do not get why it is so highly praised. Sure great performances from every single actor and actress - but the story is just. So. Uninteresting.

Not once in this movie's entire runtime was I excited or curious to know what would be happening next. Because these characters cannot get you to care about their lives. They are not sympathetic enough that you'd feel sad for them, nor they are evil enough that you'd feel anger. They don't make you feel anything. These are emotionally suppressed people with very bland personalities - and their lives suck - but it could suck less if only they weren't overdramatic because the script required them to do so. This movie just made me mad."
10,Classic. Timeless. Masterpiece. Perfect. Best film maybe ever...Must I continue?,"If you're reading this comment to decide if you should watch ""The Godfather,"" then I truly have no comment to that. That would mean that the #1 of 250 ranking on the title page, the name ""Francis Ford Coppola,"" the cast list including Marlon Brando, the ""won Oscar for best picture"" and the phrase ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" mean absolutely nothing to you.

This is the greatest crime drama if not the greatest drama if not the greatest film of all time, so yes, it is worth your time. Then you need to watch ""The Godfather: Part II.""

This is a deep, enriching and beautiful film in every sense of those words and will forever echo through cinematic history.

Looking for any other sweeping statements? I could go on and on. You can't say anything bad about this film. You could say 175 minutes is too long, but if that's what it takes for a masterpiece, so be it.

If it's not every bit of what I said it is, the canolli's on me."
8,"The one, The Original!","While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,"
8,Greatest Movie in World History? Maybe. Maybe Not.,"The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked ""The Godfather"" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me ""Citizen Kane"" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be ""Scarface"". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.

I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, ""maybe it's good because it is so real"", but that's not a convincing reason and how ""real"" it is I cannot say for sure.

If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so cliché. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line ""an offer he can't refuse"" are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being cliché make the film great? I guess that would make ""Star Wars"" the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).

And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than ""Scent of a Woman"" (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).

I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).

The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.

I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to)."
10,Definitely deserves its high rating,"I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10"
9,Actually 9.5...Godfather is Good at everything,"This is probably the best mob movie of all time which captures the old mob dramatics of the 1920-30s with the more business savvy mobs of the 1950-60s. It links the classic capones with the modern gambinos.

Al Pacino's finest silent work ever. With simple looks he envy's so much meaning. Brando at the best i have ever scene. The ensemble is absolutely amazing. This is the best of the 3, and miles above part 2 (which i like but don't think quite matches up this part 1 in anyway)

If you haven't watched this, rent the DVD and watch it this weekend. If you have and don't have the DVD collection, buy it.

IT is worth preserving this and having it in good quality."
10,"Not ""the best film ever made"" but certainly one of the great ones","The movie opens at Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) home in the 1950s. His daughter is being wed and the entire ""family"" has come to celebrate. Vito's son Michael (Al Pacino), the most ""Americanized"" of his immediate family, has rejected the traditions of his ancestors and joined the army. He has no plans of becoming an errand boy for his father.

Michael's older brother Sonny (James Caan) is hot-headed and overzealous. He is next in line to inherit ""the throne"" from Don Vito, although Vito suspects perhaps that Sonny is too heated for his own good and will never make it on his own. An important scene in the film is when he belabors his son about correcting him in front of strangers.

A plot emerges involving a corrupt policeman and a competing Mafia family, who try to assassinate Don Vito and successfully murder his eldest, Sonny. Michael steps in to avenge his father's death, but must then be sent off into exile in Sicily for a short period of time to avoid the authorities, leaving behind his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton), who wants to get married.

In terms of acting, its strength lies in Brando, Caan and Pacino. Brando is perfect - his trademark ""soft mouth"" being inimitable - whereas Caan is very good at turning Sonny into a multi-dimensional character. Pacino is great and displays intelligence and a certain suave aura, which is vital to the character. This was a glimpse of Al Pacino the actor before he turned on the screaming switch.

Francis Ford Coppola does a wonderful job behind the camera, which is more than can be said for his efforts within the last decade. Likewise the script by Coppola and Puzo is very well-written with impressive dialogue and conflicts of the characters.

""The Godfather"" isn't exactly the *best* film ever made but it's certainly a great movie; a masterpiece that redefined epic cinema much in the same way ""Lawrence of Arabia"" did."
7,Good but not the greatest movie by far,"The first thing i have to say is that it's way too long and you can barely get through it, part of this is because there are too many extended scenes in it. Granted it's a good movie, but not by any chance the best movie ever made and not better than The Shawshank Redemption (i'm comparing it to Shawshank because they are the 2 leading movies in the IMDb top). The acting is great, the script is good and the directing is OK, but that doesn't make it the best movie ever made. There's almost no foreshadowing in it, there are no major twists in the plot thus making the storyline actually a straight line and there's nothing in the movie that surprises you. When i watched it i was at the edge of boredom and was hoping something would show up in that movie that would pull me back. It's true that it was a very daring movie at the time, but still that alone doesn't make a movie great."
1,"Slow, boring, overrated and almost put me to sleep.","I honestly don't get how this movie is so highly rated... it is extremely slow and boring. The only saving grace was Marlon Brando's performance in the film, apart from that, this film literally did nothing. From someone who loves a good gangster movie, this movie was absolute garbage. Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos way and Scarface are all amazing films and make this movie seem like a lullaby because it's enough to put you to sleep with its extremely slow and gentle pace. The movie runs for appeox 3 hours and going outside and watching the grass grow would be a more exciting thrill that sitting through this absolutely overrated disaster."
10,One Of The Best Masterpiece,"One realizes the importance of movies after watching this movie.Though paced slow , yet misses nothing. The movie tells the story not just of a mafioso but also of one of the strongest and most stable characters created -The GODFATHER. One of the most remarkable part of the movie is Al Pacino's acting. In the beginning he is a very cute person and you don't see any vice in him.Now, when things go bad for him ,you see him changing ,his eyes becoming dangerous.By the end of the movie he is entirely somebody else -The next GODFATHER. The theme music has a touch of negativity in it to depict the dark side of the Godfather but the Sicilian part has very soothing music also. The only drawback(if at all it is) is the pace of the movie which might seem slow compared to these days movie with so many cuts and pacing music,but if you have the patience to watch it, only then will you realize how great the movie is."
10,Perfection,"Pure perfection, this is one of the greatest movies of all time"
10,John Cena is the Next Star in Hollywood.,"Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history. The symbolism featured in the scene, such as the shiny body oil and the ""you can't see me"" hand gesture, is the best I've ever seen. By far the best movie I have ever seen. Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history. The symbolism featured in the scene, such as the shiny body oil and the ""you can't see me"" hand gesture, is the best I've ever seen. By far the best movie I have ever seen."
9,An offer you can't refuse,"Taking the old-fashioned gangster film to new heights, The Godfather used traditional story-telling freed from the strict censorship that meant bad guys always got their come-uppance. More film noir than thriller, there are no good guys, and we meditate on the small rays of hope within the darkness of corruption, or wonder how far our good and pleasant lifestyles are supported, at some level, by corruption.

In dark, Rembrandt-like backrooms, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family grant favours, blessings, and generally run things for their friends out in the real, bright and beautiful world. A bride's father traditionally grants any wish, and petitions come from far and wide as Don Corleone's daughter has a colourful wedding celebration outside.

It's 1945. Things are changing. Narcotics is the big new industry that beckons temptingly, and one in which the other mafia families have already started. Don Corleone is cautious, but his competitors are envious of the control he has over the police and the judges and want him in. Before long, bloody warfare between the gangs ensues.

The Godfather continually contrasts dark and light, external show with violent murky depths, and the devoutness of the gangsters is emphasised. One sequence has a scene of a family baptism intercut with brutal killings ordered by the head of the gang (who is in church). Further similarities to the Roman Catholic Spanish Inquisition might be inferred from a scene immediately afterwards where a confession is obtained from a double-crossing gang member - he is promised redemption but executed anyway.

The double nature of the main characters is convincingly emphasised as we watch Don Corleone play with his grandson in the garden, or his successor Michael (Al Pacino) enjoy the idyllic countryside of Sicily. It is taken to a new level when, in a different situation, he tells a blatant lie compellingly and lovingly to his wife so she doesn't think him a murderer. His gentleness goes hand in hand with his brutal nature.

The Godfather catapulted the career of the young Francis Coppola and revitalised the career of Marlon Brando. A masterpiece of restrained film-making, its biggest fault may be that there are so many characters and details to absorb in the complex family plots for a first viewing.

In a conference over whether to deal in narcotics, one of the arguments that sways the day is that if they don't control them, someone else will step in and do so. By dealing in narcotics at the most powerful level, they can keep them away from children. An argument that should perhaps be given greater consideration by legislators.

If anyone has ever made you 'an offer you couldn't refuse', this is the film that created and popularised the phrase. It was meant quite literally."
10,The Best movie ever,"The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art. As filmmaking and storytelling, 'The Godfather' remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons."
10,The Best Film of All Time,"""The Godfather"" is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so.

""The Godfather"" has it all. The cast is classic and the acting universally stellar, the shooting scenes have just the right level of intensity, the lines are all delivered with precision, the plot is enthralling, and the characters are actually interesting to watch.

What is the secret to the success of this great film? That's a tough question, but it's really the fact that everything about the film is done to just the right level. It's never boring, and the plot holds plot twists, but not so many that you grow suspicious of the film.

As I've said, the acting is exceptional. Obviously, Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as the likable Don Vito Corleone. However, also noteworthy is James Caan's fiery performance as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall' star-making work as the cool and collective Tom Hagen. The only shame about this movie is that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for it. His portrayal of the reluctant future godfather of the family who is eventually completely corrupted by power is pitch-perfect. The fact that Joel Grey won it instead for his clown-faced role in Cabaret is laughable and painful.

The bottom line is this. ""The Godfather"" will always go down in history as the greatest film of all time, and for good reason. It's ""an offer you can't refuse."""
5,Not to my taste,"For some reason I got bored, couldn't watch it all the way. Maybe a few years later I'll try again. People always change. Maybe then I'll like it. The acting and all are certainly good, it's only the storyline that is not to my taste in my opinion."
10,Because Spielberg said so.,"What i wanted to say has already been said countless times. Ill make this short. First off i love the Godfather. This is on my 10 favorite films of all time. We all know its top 3 material but when Steven Spielberg claims to have almost retired after seeing this movie because he feared that he could never make a movie of the same magnitude as the Godfather, thats saying something coming from arguably the best film maker of the last 25 years. I wanna say that this is the best film in history but thats really a matter of ones opinion and taste. Whether its better or worse than citizen Kane is your opinion, mine goes with the Godfather. Not that Citizen Kane is far off but what are we judging on here, The films impact, or the Film it self. Citizen is judged by its impact of every film that came after it. As a film it self, I don't feel it matches up to the Godfather nor gone with the wind or Schindlers list Given the difference in eras that they were all made. But hey, thats just me. Tons of Top directors believe that the Godfather is probably the greatest. M Night Shyamalan, Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Thats some good Company there. I believe the experts."
10,Defines Life for Great Men,"""GODFATHER is beyond a being called a movie. It is a subject in philosophy which must be studied by men who want to attain great heights."" - Hisgrace

When I first saw GODFATHER, I couldn't stop seeing it for another month. Till date, I still watch it at least once a month so I could relate my affairs for the month with it. Like a mentor speaking, the words of Don Corleone flows through my head. Every move by Michael (AL Pacino) is mathematical. The logic of the whole movie (Part 1,2 & 3) cant be met by any. I tried comparing the movie 'Last Don' to it (Written by same writer, Mario Puzzo) and I just noticed that GODFATHER has no comparing mates. If anyone could come up with a movie like this again then it would have to be the same movie, GODFATHER."
9,A Great Film Art,"A GREAT MOVIE, one of the best film art ever, the actors are great especially Al Pacino that made there(in my opinion) his best performance of his career. this movie takes you inside the Italian mafia world in the US but more important, it takes you inside the Corleone family, it shows the the relationship between the father, Don Vito and his children, especially with Michael(Al Pacino). What makes this movie so fascinating is the way that Francis Ford Coppola(the director) make you to identify with the main characters - people who murder their enemies and live like they are above the law, he make you love and admire the bad guys - The Mafia. In conclusion, the godfather is one of the best movies I have ever seen and i recommend it to all the film lovers. for anothe reviews: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur44998795/?ref_=nb_usr_prof"
10,the greatest film of all time,i have only recently watched this film for the first time on TV. i didn't know what to expect i have herd great things from some people and not so great things from other people. i had previously never seen a AL Pacino film. then i watched what i believe to be the greatest film ever made and after looking at IMDb's top 250 list i realized a lot of other people loved it to. i loved it from start to finish i was immensely enthralled from beginning to end.this film has superb performances from all the cast. especially from AL Pacino who plays Michael coreleone the son of feared don Marlon Brando who dilverd another great performance. this film got me hooked on crime movies and on AL pacino who is know my favorite actor of all time and also the best. i wouldn't say every body will love this film it is slow to begin with and some people with no taste in film will say it is boring which absolutely incorrect. if you like films at all you have to see the godfather.
10,The greatest.,"The most perfect film ever made. I watched it with my father when I was young (probably too young). I have since seen it at least 50 times. The direction, acting, costume and production is faultless. There are so many scenes that will be remembered forever. So many lines that people just know from memory. The music is also sublime. Pacino for me steals the show (and what a show). Maybe only because he has more memorable scenes. Duvall, Brando and Cazale run him very close. The three scenes I love more than ever are Michael's revenge in the restaurant (greatest scene of all time!), when Michael realises from the panic in his bodyguard's face as he runs off that Apollonia is in danger and when Sonny beats up Calo and finishes him in the gutter. Superb from start to finish."
10,Best movie ever,"The Godfather is the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando played his part so well. Al Pacino also played is part well as well. The setting was fantastic and the plot was engaging. The use of camera work was just outstanding. I don't know why anyone would hate this film. It is the best gangster/mobster ever produced. This movie is way better than 'Goodfellas' or 'Scarface'. This movie had so many Oscar winning actors which boosted the rating of this movie right up. There are some action scenes in this movie and they are fantastic to watch. But the best part of the movie has to be the acting and how engaging the characters are. For everyone who was reluctant to get this movie, I suggest you buy this film or hire it out because it is a blast."
10,The Greatest Film Ever Made,"There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, ""a film you can't refuse,"" etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion.

From the legendary music (beautiful work by Nino Rota), to the cast and the acting (Brando, Pacino, and Caan), to the cinematography (brilliantly done by Gordon Willis, aka ""The Prince of Darkness""), to the fascinating story and everything in between, there is nothing about this film that disappoints. It is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once in his or her lifetime, because the chances are that you will want to watch it again."
5,BORING!!!!!!,This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen that's all that I'm gonna say.
10,"Apparently it's popular with its subject matter, even...","Everything about The Godfather is brilliantly framed--well, almost. The depiction of Sicilian country life is, perhaps, a bit crass. Even so, its insular depiction of the world of Cosa Nostra was true enough to life to win the laud even of members of the criminal organisation.

In the first place, ""The Godfather"" does an excellent job of weaving together the literal and metaphorical world of the mafia. Within the mafia, traditional institutions are given a warped, double meaning in which to frame illicit activity. For example, ""mafioso"" literally means, ""man of honour,"" but ""honour"" refers to a loyalty to an entirely different set of rules than those to which any Christian (or post-Christian) would consider even remotely acceptable. ""Famiglia,"" as used in Cosa Nostra, means a criminal corporation. ""Cristiano"" in the Sicilian tongue often designates not merely a Christian but any human being; to CN it signifies any ordinary man of honor. As for ""godfather,"" one mafioso standing godfather to another's son is often a formalisation of an illegal business pact.

Puzo's and Coppola's Corleonesci, however, carry the double-edged sword of actually showing both meanings of these loaded words. The mafia family here IS a literal family; the men of honor, portrayed as they are in a closed word, CAN actually be viewed sympathetically as ""honourable."" (Of course in real life most mafiosi are literally Catholics {albeit sham Catholics}.) Here, the closed world so carefully guarded through layers of command in real life is given further immunity and legitimacy by actually being what it publicly claims to be--and so much more.

Little needs to be said about the performances, which are by and large stellar; the casting of Al Pacino is of course a near sure sign that the film will succeed. Perhaps Diane Keaton may not be much to look at, but she does not play a major role in this installment. Neither do the cinematography, the score, the high-level tension, etc. ad infinitum, require further laud than has already been heaped upon this film. If you haven't seen it yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Immaculate taste and Latin sophistication await, all ye primitives..."
10,A True masterpiece,"This is more a comment on the comments then on the movie. The movie was so well made, great story telling, great acting, and a vivid look at a time gone by in American history. What is really funny is that reading the comments you find two or three people that say this movie was junk. To say it is not the best of all time is one thing, I like Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia better myself, but to say that this was a bad movie is unthinkable. But that is what makes this web site so much fun. Everyone can voice their opinion."
10,The Godfather of Mobster flicks,"This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family.

The struggle of the family within the family. Watch and see how Michael runs the family different that how his father did. Watch the changing of the world as a new generation takes over. One of Coppola's best. It can never be bettered."
10,Perfection Has a Name.... The Godfather,"Francis Ford Capolla's The Godfather is perfect, faultless and gripping. This film will really not stop sticking you to your chair. Al Pacino's second feature film and no doubt his best. His character is lovable and thrilling.

It all begins when The Godfather (Marlon Brando) is granting favours, on the day of his daughters wedding. It is a tradition, not to deny a wish. Chaos is caused and problems occur. Problems which cause his oldest son Sunny (James Caan) to take over his role temporarily. Sunny, being the aggressive and annoyed one of all the sons. Causes something else to occur. Each problem causes another. The adopted son Tommy (Robert Duvall) is a lawyer and is capable of making a small portion of the problems disappear. This movie is literally gripping, no matter how tired or annoyed you are. This will still end up being your number one favourite movie; and Al Pacino is Michael, the youngest son, and probably his fathers favourite. He gives a perfect performance. With other brilliant actors through out the film (John Cazalle, Dianne Keaton) this film is, I will say it again, perfect! I STRONGLY recommend this movie to absolutely anyone and everyone. Most probably the best work of the brilliant director Franciss Ford Capolla.

I give it a 110% and an 11 out of 10.

PERFECT!"
10,Watching this timeless masterpiece is an offer no one can refuse,"Most critics say it's Citizen Kane. Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years.

This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes ""offers that can't be refused"". It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently: at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.

What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.

Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.

That's an important theme: family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.

Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all."
7,Great Movie...But Not Perfect,"I agree that The Godfather is a classic and one of the greatest movies of all time but it bothers me how many people think it is absolutely perfect. It is not perfect, but it still probably deserves the number one spot. It is definitely the best mob movie ever made, but I don't like how people live and die by it."
1,Overrated In Nutshell,"When a director tries to romanticize what shouldn't romanticized such like mob crimes, prostitution laundry money works, Drugs dealing.. all this goofy stuff to present an evil version of robin hood who tries to justify a weak folks,protect his family and Pushing you in the same uncomfortable corner that your boring philosophy professor about morality , hence that fake masterpiece is the result.

So, is The Godfather an Overrated film?!

WTF, no! It is super-overrated and boring.

I had really high expectations about this movie, like ""Hey, you just must see it - that's how the world really works!"". As a journalist, I could not miss such a masterpiece. Well...the things did not work out as I had expected. First of all, in general, I found it to be way too long, boring and tedious. I get why so many people are impressed with that movie, it offers some interesting ideas to consider, some - well-hidden, though - criticism of the American society between the lines and a fascinating storyline.

I really liked some scenes and parts, for example, ""Michael-hiding-himself-in-Italy"" was really beautiful! However, most of the movie is filled up with serious guys seriously discussing serious issues with a serious accent. And that's it! There is almost no humour, no symbology, no moral, no emotional charge - and no entertainment. By the way, I had exactly the same impression from the book and, knowing the plot already, I could not make myself to finish it.

Second, the acting and the characters. I expected something really super-amazing, or at least believable and accurate, and found none of those. I am a big fan of Al Pacino, for example, he totally nailed it in the Devil's Advocate (a better movie than the GF, in my opinion) but here, his stony face is just too...stony. No sensual or emotional charge at all. Just a serious, decisive guy - and nothing more. Hard to trust or to believe. The same for Marlon Brando. The GF is the only movie with him I have seen so far but his wheezy voice makes me cringe. And these guys are supposed to be Italians? They look like they both have had a serious deal of a serious wheat.

And, the last but not the least - the accuracy. There is none. First of all, it is really...hard to believe that an Italian family, first and second generation of immigrants, speaks English with a weird accent all the time. This is just crazy and I am surprised no one mentions this epic fallacy. For God's sake, they should speak Italian at least for the purpose of conspiracy, as they do all they can to hide their activities from the state!

Second, there are almost no pictures of what the Corleones' circus is actually doing for living. We see a rich house, family dinners, rituals, consiglieris but no murders, no drugs, no prostitution, no dirty stuff, except for a couple of shots. It's an unfair presentation. There is no sense in asking whether the portrayal of the organized crime in the movie is accurate since the picture is incomplete.

Pues...to sum up, in my opinion, it's a tedious, commercial and super-superficial movie which is not bad in the common sense of these words - it might be worth seeing once. However, a fairly overrated one. The best movie of all times? No way. There are many deeper, funnier and more consistent pieces around.

In my view, a movie is great if it engages the imagination, captivates, makes one think more expansively, and above all ENTERTAINS. The Godfather does all of these, but not really to any remarkable degree. I can think of twenty other movies that outdo The Godfather in all of those categories.

Another thing: I prefer movies that tell an engaging story, and the focus of that story is about BIG IDEAS. The Godfather is one of those movies that are about people and the characters. The latter really is of little interest to people with more analytical, logical-thinking minds, and more appealing to ""feeler"" type people who get fascinated by people-focused stories and relationships.

That's it."
10,Best acting ever,"I think what made this movie so great was the actors. The directing was also very superb. As i watched this movie, 30 plus years or so after it was made, i totally was engulfed in what was going on in the movie. Most great movies that i see that are older seem to be dull and boring, not this one. Yes it is long, and i had to take frequent breaks, it was far from boring. This is one of those movies that after i saw it i started acting like i was in a mob family. I started saying ""I'm going to make him an offer he cant refuse."" This movie is a great movie that mixes all kinds of genres, from romance to action, but it is mostly a full out drama. This movie is defiantly deserving of the top honor for best movie. I recommend it to all people, and even if you cant appreciate the plot, you have to appreciate the acting. By far the best acting in any film i have ever seen."
10,Greatest of all time,"For my money the original Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. Compelling, legendary and timeless, with Marlon Brando coming out of retirement to blow the barn doors off the hinges with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, one of the most revered characters in movie history. He once again raises the bar on what a great actor can achieve and should be expected to. This movie began one of the most amazing movie careers in history with Al Pacino and also took America's guilty obsession with the ""ganster"" to new heights. It is a constant frustration for me when The Godfather II gets a higher rating then the predecessor. Also an all time great but there is likely no movie that deserves higher praise then this original ground-breaker. It has set a level of excellence for crime dramas that every movie since only strives to reach. The number of referenced and quoted scenes in modern Americana is matched only by Casablanca and thirty five years later it has still not faded in the memories of its audience.

10,"Best movie,excellent actor and amazing story","Godfather amazing movie , i am 19 years old and i so much like this movie, with absolutely the best actor Marlon Brando ! Maybe i'm young but i know what quality and excellent movie . I think that never make movie like this , because this is the best movie ever. Amazing qutoes : ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""You sonofabitch, do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders."" ""Whatya gonna do? Nice college boy, eh? Don't wanna get mixed up in the family business? Now you wanna gun down a police captain because he slapped you in the face a little bit, huh? Whataya think this is, the Army, where you shoot 'em a mile away? You gotta get up close like this... badaBING! you blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit. C'mere... you're taking this very personal."" ""She was beautiful! She was young. She was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I ever had, and I've had'em all over the world!"""
10,This is brilliant,"The Godfather is a fantastic movie to watch. The story to it is just fantastic. I don't think you could beat a movie like this, but as well as the other fantastic movies, the godfather is one of the classics i think of all time. This is top of the imdb list as it's the number 1 top 250 movie at the moment, it has been for a long time and i would think it would take some beating to knock this movie off the 250 top movies list. I think that there won't be a better movie that would top the 250 best movies ever, because the godfather is an amazing movie and it is fantastic. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
10,The best for all time,"The Godfather is one of the best movies ever, the movie is made for 30 years ago and it´s the best movie i ever seen and will see. If you think "" Casino"", or "" Goodfellas"", is a great gangster movie than you should see The Godfather all parts. I recommend this movie to all over 18 so they can see the beauty on this, i dont really belive the teenager will see that."
7,Vito Corleone ain't gonna win Father of the Year,"Very few movie dads come off worse than Vito Corleone. As he postures and pretends to be a man of honor and a man who loves his family, he's all the time setting in motion the elements that will wound or destroy his kids. No man is in the Mafia unless he's just a greedy SOB. So, Don Corleone mortgages his children's future at a very high interest rate in order to become a multimillionaire off of bootlegging, labor-union corruption, gambling and loan-sharking. One son is horribly murdered by a thousand bullets, his only daughter, Connie, is eventually left an embittered and tragic widow before she turns 25, his grandson by Connie is left orphaned thanks to in-house vengeance, his eldest son is corrupted and eventually under the mob thumb in Vegas and his idealistic youngest boy is overwhelmed by the old Mafia game and eventually seizes headship of The Commission by committing one of the worst mass-murders in New York history. Don Vito said in the third scene of this movie, ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."" He should have focused on demonstrating values to his family, not just spending all that time with them."
1,What makes a movie a good movie,"In my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater, or puts a feeling on you that you haven't experienced. You have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing.

I also ask what makes and entertaining movie. To me its one that you just cant get enough of. You can watch over and over again and it never gets old."
10,Perfect,"It's really hard to argue against this film as the greatest of all time. The Godfather is one of those rare instances where incredible plot meets incredible interpretation. It has Iconic performances to iconic characters. Dialogues that are bursting with quotes, style, and even wisdom. Themes that resonate immediately with anyone: family, loyalty, honor, power, revenge, legacy. Etc.

The story is essentially an emotional tragedy sprinkled with humor/fun. It makes us feel for this family. Moments of warmth if you will, largely thanks to characters like Vito (warmth) or Sonny (humor). As such we feel more impact when family members make mistakes that effect the whole.

There's also something special about how the film interacts with the viewer, and it's hard to exactly explain what it is; it's an unusual tone. I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes: the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music. I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.

It's just damn perfect."
10,The Godfather might be the best movie ever made.,"What is there to say about The Godfather? That it is one of the best movies ever we all already know. What makes me like it so much? It was the movie that got me interested in the Movie industry. The movie that touched me so much i immediately knew that I wanted to make movies. Without this movie my life wouldn't look like it does today. But it isn't just me that this movie has affected. The whole world loves it and hails it as one of the best movies ever. Some (including me) even ranks it as THE best movie ever.

Based on the Novel by Mario Puzo The Godfather, after a lot of problems during the shooting, was released in 1972 and was a great success. It was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best director Francis Ford Coppola, best Costumes, Best Supporting Actor: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Best Scrip based on previously published or produced material: Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola, Best Leading Actor: Marlon Brando and Best Movie, and won the three last mentioned. The movie got 3 sequel's, one released in 1974 and one in 1990, both directed by Coppola and written by Puzo.

The acting is superb, Brando does the performance of his life. Al Pacino, who got his breakthrough in this movie, together with James Caan and Robert Duvall make perfect supporting actors. For examples take a look at Pacino in the restaurant scene, Caan when he is arguing with Tom Hagen, or Duvall when he delivers a horrible message to his father played by Brando. The writing is amazing, it is true to the amazing novel, a lot of the dialogue is taken directly from it. The directing is perfect, he sets the perfect feeling and mood for the movie and it's a mystery that he didn't win the Oscar for his directing.

To conclude the review.The Godfather is a true masterpiece that no-one should miss, maybe it will change your life the way it changed mine? It is in my Opinion The best Motion Picture ever created."
10,Too Good!!!!!,"First of all this Movie contains a message and that is 'If you have the power use it your way'. An in the movie the director followed it perfectly. His work should be applauded What a movie!!! This is basically a movie on gangsters! and this has everything in the life on a don 'The Godfather'. This movie obviously deserves 10! Acotrs acted brilliantly, Story was brilliant, direction was awesome, It's just perfect! 'The Godfather' has everything to call it 'The Godfather' it has emotions, action, real life, romance everything is perfect in it! I am not amazed with the fact that it's no.1 in the world it should be! And by the way a film which which is this real should be no.1! The film has answered everything about a don's questions! You can use this film's message into your life and that is: 'If you have the power use it your way'"
10,the best film ever,"I have been looking for a better film than this one for a long time, i have been looking for better acting, directing or writing but i haven't find it yet, not even the great geniuses of Bergman or Fellini have deliver us with such a masterpiece. Brando at his best, and the big appearances of such actors as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire and many others. The writing is superb, i've read the book, and together with the film they are both my favorites, and the directing is Coppola getting the whole essence of the honor, respect, devotion, love, desire and revenge. is totally illogical that two films like the dark knight or the The Shawshank Redemption (great films by the way) are better voted that this, the greatest masterpiece on cinematic history"
10,I´m the filmfreak. And in the future I´m going to be a film director,I think the Godfather is the greatest movie which is ever made. I was a little boy when i saw the film and since then I have think that it is the greatest movie and it´s still the greatest. I love the Godfather! And that is the reason why I want to be a director in the future.
10,Take a look at the accomplishment of a masterpiece,"Godfather is a one of a kind film. Nothing can ever beat this kind of story, with the Mafia and organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film. Watch it, and be sure to watch the second one also."
10,One of the true undisputed classics of American cinema,"Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don't know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone's husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it's a miracle it's managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It's also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola's head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it's just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it.

Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Sicilian head of the Corleone crime family. His eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is his short-tempered and hot-headed heir, the polar opposite to the youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who is college-educated and has just returned from serving in World War II. When the Don refuses an offer to invest in the booming drugs trade by drug baron Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) - who is backed by Corleone rivals the Tattaglia's - he is gunned down and almost killed. With his father in hospital and still in danger, Michael finds himself slowly being drawn into the family business he vowed to stay away from.

Head of Paramount at the time Bob Evans said he wanted to ""smell the spaghetti"" and hired the relatively inexperienced Coppola, who is of Sicilian heritage, to direct the film, in order to give the film authenticity. From the opening scene, it is evident that the gamble paid off. The wedding of the Don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), is a textbook guide on how to introduce characters to an audience. This long, gorgeous segment of the film establishes the Corleone's sense of family importance. They are all cold-blooded killers, perhaps, but they are loyal and have a code. It's also fascinating to see the hierarchy within organised crime, something that seems embedded into our conscience now after countless films involving 'made' men and capo's.

But it's a combination of many elements that makes The Godfather so great. The patient, controlled approach, Coppola and novel author Mario Puzo's celebrated, Oscar-winning screenplay, Nino Rota's powerful score, the subtle dark comedy (""leave the gun, take the cannoli"") the magnificent set-pieces (Michael searching for the gun in the cafe restroom is still nerve-jangling) , and perhaps most of all, the acting talent on display. Brando, Pacino and Robert Duvall (as adopted son and consigliere Tom Hagen) can boast career-defining performances from the picture, and can celebrate film careers spanning decades and countless awards. There's little I can say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, but this is one of the true undisputed classics of American cinema.

7,Overrated. A lot.,"I don't get it. Other than Brando (he is okay not crazy good), all other characters aren't interesting or well acted.

Al Pacino's Micheal isn't credible at all as the crime lord he is depicted at the end to be.

1,The most over-rated movie of all time,"I will never, ever understand the love affiar people have with this movie. It is completely and utterly over-rated. Marlon Brando is not the god of an actor he and people make him out to be. Neither is Al Pachino for that matter. The acting is pretty stiff and unbelieveable. It was so freaking LONG. Ugh, I hate this movie."
10,One of the Greatest Films of All Time,"I'll admit the movie at first was very boring, but after watching again, I fell in love with it. A movie that is really flawless. Incredible Story (I WON'T REVEAL ANY OF IT), Great Directing, Very Intense and deep scenes throughout the film, great music, the stage is very well set (this takes place in the 1940s, it was filmed in 1972 and it was almost as if it was filmed in the 1940s). And the most important of all is the acting, THIS MOVIE HAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. To start, James Caan places as ""Sunny Corleone"", Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" (you may also know him from ""Apocalypse Now""), The Legendary Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" puts up a hell of a show. And to top of it all was perhaps the Greatest Actor of All Time behind Humphrey Bogart: Marlon Brando as ""Vito Corleone"" Brando was the old actor, but still put up a great show starting a franchise that became one of the greatest films of all time. The film won Best Picture (despite being an R rated film), and Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Lead Role. I'd probably start a debate just saying it's the greatest film of all time, but I'm going to do it anyway, THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME, everything is perfect in this film. You are not educated in Filmographically if you haven't seen this movie. If this movie didn't exist, the movies nowadays would be 100% different than what they are now. Period."
10,One of the best film ever made.,"The Godfather is known for being one of the best films ever made and i have to agree.The performances in the film are amazing,from the raspy-voiced Marlon Brando to the amazing Al Pacino.And Despite the fact that the film is over three hours long it compels you through the whole thing.

The Godfather is about an old Don of the Corleone Mafia Family(Marlon Brando).His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.

This film is a work of art that remains to this day one of the the best film ever made.

10/10(i wish that i can give it higher)"
10,A masterpiece,"This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.

I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.

I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.

Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the ""message"" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.

But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.

Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.

This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live.

From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.

Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.

Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.

10,"An Aging Don, after being assassinated leaves his empire to his youngest son",This movie deserves its place on the top of IMDb's top 250 list. The acting is excellent nobody did bad in this film even the extras. The cinematography was beautiful showing New York in the World War Two era with great authenticity. If you have not seen this excellent movie then you should rent a copy and if you enjoy it buy the box set and watch the entire collection. I believe even the third movie was a masterpiece most people did not like that one because the movie was a little fast paced without any relaxed and beautiful moments like the first two. I believe that everybody should see this movie and even if it doesn't show the Mafia realistically it is still an American Masterpiece and should be watched by everyone.
9,Godfather lives,"This movie has an answer for everyone. Don't know what that answer is watch again. Can't find an answer, dig deep.

The hierarchy in human beings is reflected in many forms of our creation including religion, race, communities and nations. The order is established only when there is a leader (even in communism).

Godfather and the other characters in the movie establish the order of human beings with balance of power (to lead, communicate and protect).

This movie has presented the ideology of Godfather in a way that predicts human nature better than many other films.

Those who cannot interpret/correlate this movie with their own lives, please see it again with that notion. Makes a world of difference."
10,Greatest Movie of All Time,"Anybody who denies the entire trilogy as being a cinematic masterpiece is not a fan of cinema. This is by far and will most likely be the best picutre of all time. It is a movie that contains some of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures. Marlon Brando had a stunning comeback as the result of this movie. Al Pacino also proved that he is truly one of the screens greatest actors and this movie reminds us why we love him so much. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Richard Constellano vividly brought their characters to life in a truly unforgettable film in the first film while Robert De Niro and Lee Strassberg did it in the second film. All in all this is the greatest trilogy of all time"
6,a film depicting the little Italy in NY,"People always say America is a big melting pot, but actually it is not actually like that. America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism."
1,An Ugly Movie,"""The Godfather"" was a sickening experience the first time I saw it in its initial release, and it hasn't changed. I thoroughly disliked the film's spirit, finding it very ugly at its heart. I saw little justification for its existence, was sorry I saw it, and have tried to forget it."

Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by"
9,"Terrible, Junk Film","""The Godfather"" is a 'terrible' film.

It's 'the worst' movie I've seen in a decade. The acting in this film is 'excruciatingly painful'. The whole family are 'watered down Sopranos' who show some phenomenally strong 'lack of' chemistry. The 'boring' weeding scene is the 'highlight'.

Michael is a 'wet fish' and his relationship with Kay is very dumb, and also 'stupid' and 'weird'. The Godfather scenes make me 'sick' and 'woozy'. I haven't seen such dramatized 'try to be cool' dialogue since ""Any Given Sunday"".

Pacino was less wooden in ""Gigli"". That other film he also 'carried'. Both Puzo and Brest were largely let down thanks to this 'Tony Montana' The characters of Sonny and Fredo were so 'unrealistic' I thought they were 'comic book'. I must also highly criticize the music in this film as being 'childish' and sometimes often 'out of place'.

Now on to some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'silly'. If it was supposed to be nail-biting, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the actors delivered their lines was 'uninspiring'. Brando in particular 'sucked'. What about the 'long' and 'tired' Sicily scenes? Reference to four hours of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" I don't know? The car exploding was so 'unoriginal' and 'clichéd'. And the 'take over' cross baptism montage. Come on, do some CGI instead! Bah, 'armatures'.

How this is ranked above that masterpiece ""Muriel's Wedding"" stumps me. If they had replaced the old and tired Francis Ford with the more youthful Nicolas they might have hit pay dirt."
9,I like movies more than books,"Godfather has a epic soundtrack. I am sure that someone who has a little knowledge about movies, is privy to this OST. It is a masterpiece for sure.

The first time I watched this movie I had a 2 CD version of it. The second CD was broken/scratched and I really was so bored that I did not consider to watch this part on stream. I don't know why this movie is so high rated even if my father likes this movies.

I do not blame anyone for watching this series of Godfather but those who watched it, cannot tell why they like this movies either. By the way I have watched every film starring Al Pacino and these are the only I could not finish at all! It has a very long, uninteresting and well known story which has a high budged.

If you don't believe me, ask your friends who watched it. You will see what I am trying to tell because they only will tell you: ""Well.. it is.. just watch it! It's a great movie""."
10,F Fords 2008 Restoration- An Offer I Didn't Refuse,"The Cordleone family is modeled on a Mafia family which existed. The Mario Puzo novel was highly fictionalized & made for an interesting premise. The classic line from this film ""I'm going to make them an offer they can't refuse,"" has become the most cliché line ever uttered from a film.

Marlon Brando was well suited for his role in this plodding drama. The 2008 restoration of the Godfather by Copola on DVD brings this film, not only back to original form but even better. The set available now has all 3 films plus extras. When I watched to original now restored, I realized just how great this movie is.

This film takes it time telling it's story and it is much more classic story telling over action. The restoration makes the dark film play much better than older prints I have seen before. It is in 5 speaker sound for home theater systems. After seeing how good this original is, I am looking foreword to checking out 2 & 3.

James Caan, Abe Vigoda head a stellar list of folks supporting Brando here with incredible acting by Al Pacino as the son heir apparent. There is plenty of reason to watch this restored version. It is done with an obvious flair and once you watch this, you easily forget HBO's poor relative, The Sopranos. If they face Brando, they wouldn't last 5 minutes."
8,What is wrong with you people???!,"I have heard the huge uproar about how great this movie is and I was looking forward to seeing it. I had high expectations so I don't know how that affected my opinion, but I think the movie was a complete waste of my time. I had seen Road to Perdition not even a month before it and consider that movie to be far superior in an intellectual standpoint, considering the magnetic performances of Tom Hanks and Jude Law. The only somewhat decent acting in The Godfather was done by Al Pacino and Sophie Coppola. I almost fell asleep watching this thing. I do not understand why it is such a classic. It was a waste of my three dollars to even rent it!"
10,Nothing short of Over rated,"Okay so when I watched this film on Sunday before I had any idea what horrible pile of poop this was going to be, I thought too my self ""this could be my favourite movie"". Well it turned out to be nothing more then the most boring piece of flying poop I've seen in my life. The acting is mediocre at best and the pace of the movie never changes, its just slow slow slow. Jesus Christ, I really couldn't care if all of the actors died in the movie since I had absolutely no interest in it. The movie too me was so boring and bland that It took me over a week to watch it since its pace is incredibly slow and it never changes. The best part of the movie was when it showed the credits and ended, I said to my self ""Thank god this fail is over"" Quote on quote. Anyways to sum it up don't watch this over rated piece of icky buffalo poop that a skunk died on if you know what a good movie is."
7,"Decent movie, but greatly overrated","I just recently viewed the Godfather and while I find it an enjoyable movie, there is no way it deserves the #1 rank in the top 250 movies of all time. The plot is not that involved and the movie is a bit to long and drags in several scenes. I found myself wondering when it was going to end and that is not the sign of a great movie."
1,It insists upon itself.,"Since we're all gonna die, there's one more secret I feel I have to share with you: I did not care for The Godfather.

They say it's good. This is what everyone always said.

It takes forever getting in; you spend like six and a half hours... You know, I can't get through it, I've never even finished the movie. I've never seen the ending.

I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it, and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs.

I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different language. You know, that's where I lose interest in it.

It insists upon itself."
10,The 10...,"One of the classic movies and one of my favorites movie of all time is ""The Godfather"". It is a movie that show us how are the things in mafia from an inside look. In this movie you will understand how things work in mafia and which is the followed hierarchy.

Marlon Brando made on of his best performances of his entire career as Don Vito Corleone and it seemed as he had won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1973. You will also love the performance of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (Nominated for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).

""The Godfather"" is a movie that you must see and I strongly recommend it to you and I am sure that you will rate it with a 10/10."
10,Lengthy? YES! Boring? NO! Entertaining? OH YES! That's an offer I won't refuse!,"A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where ""The Turk""(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!"
10,Utimately Great,"''The Godfather'' is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.

The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ''Don't ever take sides against the family.'' It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.

''I went to the police, like a good American,'' the man says. The Godfather's reply will underpin the entire movie: ''Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.'' As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of film-making: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.

The screenplay of ''The Godfather'' follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told ''someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .'' and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito's desire to spare his wife the sight of their son's maimed body. And notice how a woman's ''mistaken'' phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It's done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out."
10,"Oh my god, we've created movie greatness or a mafia hit","What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes ""Never personal"". He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering ""Yes"", would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it's ilk, better's it."
10,Classic,"Though totally fictional, there is a reality that is seen very little in films today, and the fact that this was made in 1972 makes it even more special.

Before this film, from at least what I know, crime dramas involving organized crime have always made it black and white; crime was wrong no matter what the circumstances were.

The complexity of a criminal being a truly honorable man (Vito Corleone), and his son (Michael) who has the greatest love for him is just remarkable. That being said, the irony of all that honor and love set inside a world of corruption and murder is very odd, but works quite well.

What I liked about it was that they used situations from real cases, such as an infamous Italian diner scene in New Jersey being similar to the assassination of Joe ""The Boss"" Masseria made possible by ""Lucky"" Luciano."
10,To the people who hated this movie,"I realize that taste is subjective, but when I read the review of contributors to this site who pan great movies, I wonder about their IQ or their concept of quality. Unless they just love to type their venom on a page or have other emotional problems, it seems difficult for them to understand the quality of a movie

Instead of saying: A lot of people like this film. It is the highest rated film in the database. Maybe I am missing something here. Maybe I do not understand what character development is all about. Perhaps I don't know good acting from bad. Maybe I do not like a certain actor and it is coloring my entire view of the movie. Maybe the movie offends my moral sense and therefore I cannot like it without subjecting my soul to hell.

Or maybe, I cannot put myself in the context of the time the film was made. Sure, the phrase: 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!' is trite today. But it wasn't when the movie was made! Although the Mafia was not a new concept to most people, the idea that crime families lived like normal people was a revelation, taken one step further with 'The Sopranos.'

Similarly, one cannot compare 'The Sands of Iwo Jima'with 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although both had good production values of their times, the technology of the 90's made Ryan seem to be a better picture.

To summarize, before you consider yourself another Roger Ebert, read the reviews of the people who liked the movie and try to understand what they saw and why you did not fully appreciate it. Then, sit down at your computer and type, without ranting, a well reasoned critique that may be of use to others."
8,Great once its got going,"The film is an all round great.It really starts to shine however about half way through, after that it never looks back and neither can you.From that moment on your eyes are fixed on the screen.Its a must see movie so if you haven't had the honour of seeing it yet then i advise you do so.Probably one of the best gangster films ever to be created.Marlon Brando places himself above the bar with his performance as thee Godfather.You basically can't go wrong with Marlone Brando and Al Pacino in the same film on top form throughout.After watching your'll probably never look at a horses head in the same way though, or fall out with anyone who knows you have a horse.A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!"
10,like no other,"the godfather could be a symbol more than just a movie this is probably the best movie ever made and included the efforts of the best there was in Hollywood from Puzo to Brando to Al Pacino to the other giant names in Hollywood who remained till today symbols more than actors

the story of the godfather is one of the greatest and the most complicated and gave a lot of insight to the way the mob men think and the kind of conspiracies they run in order to stay on top

the cast was one of a kind starting from the godfather Mr. Brando who made a hell of a job and earned his Oscar beautifully without doubt then to the marvelous Al Pacino who made a textbook job and going through most of the names Caan and Cazale and all the other well placed actors who made Mr. Puzo look good!

the big star in this masterpiece was Mr. Coppola because this is a drama and in a drama the star is basically the director then comes every other name

the music was one of a kind and till this day it is the favorite for many and was very wisely chosen to match the majestic appearances of the drama and the story and the events

and finally the big tragedy which in this case was Al Pacino.. how come he did not get the Oscar??? this was one of the best performances in the history of Hollywood and still he did not get the Oscar..what a shame what a shame

any way this did not affect the godfather in any way and is still the best movie ever made"
7,What was all the fuss about?,"Well, sitting back and watching objectively as I could, I saw The Godfather for the first time last night.

I thought that since there is so much reference to this movie in comedy, drama, satire etc, that there must be some substance.

Sadly not really. How this movie got to the top of the 250 is a mystery I'll never understand. Even Citizen Kane is a better view than this item.

Perhaps this film was groundbreaking in its day, but frankly, Marlon Brando was laughable (as usual), the characters were stereotypical (though I guess they are the model for a generation of stereotypes that came after), and the story unremarkable. Kind of like the Thorn Birds meets Married To The Mob.

That said, the film was OK. I gave it 7/10, but it got an extra point or two for having influenced so many other movies.

Give me the Sopranos any day."
1,That was pathetic.,"I don't see what anybody saw in this movie, boring, and redundant. I was bored with the film, and it is a horrible attempt to make a good movie. If you have any taste what so ever you will turn down a crapfest like this and watch something respectful like Batman, or The Rookie, or heck even Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In any event stay away from this waste of film. 0 out of 10."
10,Definitely one of the best films ever made,"The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast, genius writing, and direction. Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again."
10,"BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here It is the review from Parts 1-2-3 together)","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word ""perfection""? Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.

While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.

As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.

Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.

The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.

But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the ""American Dream""; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .

Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.

Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.

Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes ""The Godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today

10/10"
8,Overrated.,I truly don't get why people idolize it so much. A great movie? Yes. The best of all times? Never.
10,The media has made it a mockery you couldn't ignore,"The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is ""is it really the greatest film of all time?"" I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.

I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.

Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.

I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.

Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.

The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be ""overrated"" and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many ""best film"" lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.

But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about ""The Doughnut Godfather,"" where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,"" we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.

Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.

This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.

Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola."
8,Over rated,"Why is this so overrated? The wedding sequence is so dull ,it made me bored.Come on the editor has done an ugly job.This movie could well be in 130-150 minutes.An overrated movie that takes too much time.Believe me skip this one,it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.The movie stands to its hype."
10,"Good, but Great?","I appreciate this movie as a very good piece of cinema but i really cant understand why its #1 in the Top250.

Ok the performances are solid, the direction is fluid and the story tight, but it isn't one of those movies you leave the theatre feeling your life is changed or anything like that...

Greatest movie of all time? I think not."
10,Geeky Randy's summary,"Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.

**** (out of four)"
6,Regular,"I don't know why this film became the most overrated movie of all time. To me(and a lot of people), it was just a regular gangster movie, nothing more."
1,bad,"Terrible, boring, slow, long, weird. It felt like it dragged on forever with scenes that were disgusting but not even scary or dramatic-just cheap shock for no reason. The whole thing felt pointless and empty, as if it had no story, no creativity. The characters were dull and uninteresting, with no real development or purpose. The acting was flat and uninspired, making it even more of a chore to watch. Visually, it was unremarkable, with no standout scenes or moments. The film seemed like it was trying too hard but failed to be memorable or meaningful in any way. It's also extremely overrated-people praise it faaaaaar more than it deserves, and I can't understand why. Just a complete waste of time that left me feeling frustrated and disappointed, totally not recommending it to anyone at all."
10,The greatest movie ever made,"I had heard a lot about this epic masterpiece for so many years and so I tried to get a DVD copy or catch a T.V premiere or any possible way.Finally,the wait was over.And to my surprise it was worth the wait

The movie is not your usual type of movie.Its got brains,guts and glory all over it.The performances are extraordinary from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.You will have a great time watching this movie as every aspect of the movie is just perfect right from the acting department to the cinematography department.

I am very happy to have lived to this day to have watched the best cinematic experience ever.......THE GODFATHER."
10,"""It's strictly business""","There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.

Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.

The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets – voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience – and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot – we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence – no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.

Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.

When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top."
10,"""leave the gun,take the cannoli""","much has been said about how great this film is,and i hesitated for the longest time before breaking down,but finally i bought the Restoration Box set which contains the three films and two bonus discs.so,after watching this first film,i must say i was pretty impressed.it's a well crafted film.at a running time of just over one hundred and seventy three minutes,you'd never know it.there never a dull moment.it's exceptionally engrossing from the opening frame to the closing credits.the acting is superb.Marlon Brandon is excellent,but i would say that a young Al Pacino matches him.the dialogue is also well written.for me,The Godfather is a 10/10"
10,this is the best of all Hollywood movies ever,"this is always the TOP.excellent movie in Hollywood industry .Pacino rocks.if anybody thinks this is a long one then they are not worth of seeing this movie.three and half hours of excellence in all including cinematography,screenplay,music and climax is awesome.nice movie of all times. its worth as it still in 2 ND place even after this long time . even though its from book, the way of expressing as movie is very very difficult which is excellently done by Francis ford Coppola. greatest movie of all time.and the second and third part of this movie are also nice movies .but first always stands first.its truly the masterpiece.as long as its length , there is no boring scene in this movie when compared to other long movies"
10,Godfather is still on the top; boring....,"Yes yes, this movie is a fundamental classic, an epic piece, a masterstroke from Coppolla, Brando, Pacino, etc. But is it really the best movie ever? Well, that's how I interpret the fact it has been on the top of IMDb since I've looked in here for the first time. What makes it so flawless, what contributes to its eternal shining, blah blah. Maybe it's high time for a change, I'm sure a lot of cult classics have been released since The Godfather has been released. Oh well...

I don't like The Godfather. I simply don't feel this movie. Yes it's gloomy, yes it's about mafia's dirty deeds, and oh yes it's about being a part of a family. And of course it's about Kleenex in Marlon's mouth, and Pacino's hands kissed by sad Italians. However I have a feeling that this movie has spawned a countless number of mafia movies, recycling the same themes and Robert De Niro, and furthermore movies like 60 Seconds or Ronin or The Italian Job, which are merely about how cool is it to be a gangster. Which I hate, obviously."
6,Over Rated...but if you want to jump on the band wagon,"Good solid movie, but far from the greatest movie or even greatest gangster movie of all time.

Doesn't come close to Good Fellas or Casino."
5,As others suggested Overrated is the right definition,"I have recently watched Godfather again and my initial opinion did not change. There is a story but characters are superciliously described. In some cases they do not relate to the story completely. The competition among rival gangsters should have been better described to the audience.

There are other movies also leaves an uncompleted feeling at the end of it, but this one is different. The main components of a movie is missing,a lacking integrity included at its ending.

Ladies and gentleman, I admit it could make a few good entry episodes for a gangsters TV series, which it did in a way in the long run but overall, this movie deserves nothing close to its current position in the IMDb top movies list."
10,THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies...,"THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies is an understatement for the line 'THE GODFATHER of all movies'. You won't miss any element of a great movie in this. Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.

There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now."
10,Brief comment on a masterpiece not without flaws,"I will keep my review to a minimum as so much has been written on this film. It is a fantastic film (up there with Once Upon a Time in the West as one of the greatest of all). I watched it again for the 8th time after not seeing it for 5 years or so, and had forgotten just how immersive the film is. My only negative comment, and I add this as I haven't heard this criticism before, is that this is one of the few films that would benefit from being a little longer. At times the film cuts between scenes too quickly and speeds through threads looking almost cartoony, which is at odds with the general mood of the film of a slow relaxed immersive experience. In particular consider when Tom visits Hollywood to get Johnny Fontane a role. The sequence seems almost rushed as one minute Tom is in NY then LA and then cut, cut, cut suddenly there's a horse's head.. This happens a number of times in the film and probably resulted from studio pressure to reduce the film's running length. Overall though a masterpiece."
10,"Dedicated to my good friend and partner, the late Patrolman Angelo Renardo (1935-86), Chicago Police Department, who loved the picture!","MOTION PICTURES having organized crime as the subject matter seem to be forever ""IN"" as fair game for a movie (""Film' if it's a special, 'Top-Shelf'production). In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI).

FINALLY we have a category which is fiction, but not strict fiction; being an original work which, while not being the representation of historical events, it contains fictional events that are inspired by real life occurrences.

THIS is the type of storyline that makes for the best fiction; also this type is the one that makes and needs those disclaimers that appear in the either the opening or closing credits of a Feature Film or TV series episode that say something like: ""THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM/TV EPISODE ARE FICTICOUS. NO COMPARISON TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD ARE INTENDED NOR SHOULD BE INFERRED.""

TODAY'S honored/dissected film, MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER(Alfan Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1972), is perhaps the best example of an exponent of this category of Gangster Film. While we all are aware that the story is not a true one; at the same time we also note that there are many characters and occurrences in the story, both in the book and on the screen, that were clearly either suggested by real people and actual incidents or were out and out caricatures of such.

READILY we can identify fictional characters in the story that were doubtless obvious make-believe versions of denizens from our real world. The main character of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) seems to be a composite character; having taken certain characteristics from both Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, New York Underworld Big-Wigs both as well as Dons of two different 'Families'. Carlo Gambino even had been known as 'the Godfather'.

ANY casual gambler or vacationer recognizes that the character of Moe Green, a Las Vegas Casino Operator closely corresponds to the profile of real-life Ben ""Bugsy"" Siegel; who was both an early advocate and promoter of investing in and expanding the already existing gambling in 'Sin City'.(Ben Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty in BUGSY (Baltimore Pic./Mullholland Prod./Dessert Vision/Tri-Star, 1991, but that's another story!)

QUITE POSSIBLY the most obvious connection between the factual actual and the all made-up fictional lies in that of the fictional singer. 'Johnny Fontaine' (real life singer Al Martino) has the most widely held opinion of naming 'old blue eyes'(himself), Frank Sinatra as being the leading suspect.

THERE is indeed many similarities both in Mr. Martino's characterization, as well as the story's references to ""That Movie Big Shot"" and Johnny Fontaine's not getting the part in the War Picture that he wanted.* But in the novel, the singer Fontaine has a Comedian Partner! Can you say Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis? Allen & Rossi? how about Brown & Carney, Wheeler & Woolsey, Clark & McCullough, Abott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Samson & Delilah, St. Paul & Minneapolis....

ON a personal note; the reported indignation expressed by some Italian-American Civic groups over NBC's premiere network broadcast of the film seemed to be less serious than originally reported; as practically every Italian we ran into that day said something like, ""Hey! The Godfather's on tonight!""

AND in summary, we admit it, we love those Gangster Pictures. Most folks do. But our only real criticism of the Film and the Puzo Novel is that they both tend to raise the status of Don Corleone to that of being something that a real Gangland Boss would not ever be. By way of a comparison, let us just say that Vito's conscientious and benevolent characterization is an extreme and a sophomoric falsehood. It rings no truer than the persona given to mythical Nevada Senator Geary(G.D.Spradlin) as a completely evil, patently dishonest & ruthless louse in THE GODFATHER, PART II, (1974).

NOTE * The references are thought by many to be of Frank Sinatra's getting the part in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY over Columbia Pictures Mogul Harry Cohn's preference for Eli Wallach. Maybe, but again, maybe not.

AND remember, Schultz, the answer is no about the singer character. He was Johnny Fontaine, not Frank Fontaine (Crazy Googenheim in the Joe the Bartender segment of THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (CBS, 1960's)!)"
9,""" I'll warn you only once, don't ever go up against the family ""","The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called ""The Godfather"" about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as ""I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse."" A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****"
8,Very long winded and disappointing !!,"I was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created, it was no.1 in the IMDB chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted £12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours!! if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre !!"
10,The irony of being pretentious.,"There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of ""BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME"". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions—Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others—but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.

Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .

But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for—the horse—but beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.

Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly cliché-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.

The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.

With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.

Perhaps it was very influential in cinema—why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious ""film buffs"" claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? ""CLASSIC"" is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather—other than the generic ""good plot, good acting, etc.""—is considered so great is, ""BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP."" Maybe what they're really trying to say is, ""I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it.""

9,visual wine,"My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that ""you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film."" At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.

With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.

I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea : the rationalizing of murder by calling it ""business, not personal"", which is appalling.

I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets : the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in. To my mind, the Godfather is probably the best compromise we've yet seen between art and commerce."
10,It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great!!!,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug- trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisers Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels"
6,Not a Fan,Just didn't like it that much. Maybe I'll like it more when I'm older
5,"What a great setting, but something else?","This is one of the mythical films in the history of cinema. As well as Taxi driver, I think it is overrated. If it is true that the film has an impressive setting. That the actors are very well. The problem is that it does not catch me. He can not hook me. When it seems that it is going to put interesting Al Pacino goes away of trip and does things that do not make sense and that do not come to story.

The photography is spectacular, such as art, makeup, costumes, the overall setting is fine. The actors also do very well.

The management however, although it takes well the tone, but is that to my Coppola I do not like, I am sorry, but I do not like how it directs. He can not catch me in any way. Neither with history nor with beauty, which does not exist, nor with plans. I do not like anything that is a film shot basically in the foreground. Of course it has open plans, but all the conversations are in the foreground, there is nothing staging. The character of Al Pacino seems totally inconsistent to me, as soon as it says white makes black. It is the most variable character of the whole cast.

Yet this is the best of the three, because the two is worse and the three is worse still in every way."
10,One of the top 10 greatest American films of all time,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece tells the saga of the Corleone family. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of one of the five mafia families. With his son Sonny (James Caan) and lawyer/adviser Tom (Robert Duvall) he runs the family. But the heads of the other families see the Don as too powerful and out of date with the times. They want to get into drug trafficking and the Don wants none of that. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the Don's other son who has returned from the military.

This film is great on every level. The acting, characterizations, dialog and visuals are all perfectly done. For one film to have such a great performance as Brando gives as the Don is one thing. But for the same film to have a second great performance (Pacino's Michael Corleone) is unheard of. Virtually everyone in this film gives an outstanding performance.

This film is #3 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list, right after Citizen Kane and Casablanca."
10,"Way overrated, perhaps one of the most overrated films of all time","I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.

It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film.

One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )

But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those ""american"" cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?

From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one."
10,milestone in cinema history,"there are no words to express the way i feel about this movie. watching it was like looking into the eyes of God, and knowing that i was his most glorious creation. i give this film a ten because it is one of the most incredible movies ever made, and because it is nothing short of perfection. the acting is superb to say the least, the directing is legendary. the sets were monumental. this is a film that should be shown to newborns as they break from the crest of there mothers womb, it should be the first sight they see. i salute every member of the crew, from the star actor right down to the guy who swept the floors after the last day of shooting."
10,Best movie so far...,"The worlds best movie. I simply love the story, the music, the acting, the casting, the filming, the dialog, the flow of the story line, the director, the editing. The audio commentary is also great fun. A 3 hour movie that feels much less. I have re-watched this movie 20 times and I'm far from done with it."
10,best movie that I ever seem,"Single film, engaging, holds the attention from start to finish. one of the trilogies best I've ever seen, second only to The Matrix and overcoming works like Mad Max. A classic noir film and recommended to all movie lovers on gangsters and the Mafia. The story is unique and the adaptation of the book was great. Quite unique, untouchable. A true masterpiece.

8,Watch it twice!,"I wasn't too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.

The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say it's a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but I'm not denying that it's a good movie.

Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it like I did!"
7,Not what it seemed to be.,"This movie was not #1 of the top 250 worthy. It was not the greatest film of all time. Even though, I did enjoy watching this, I would only give the a 6.2/10. If you are dying to see this, don't. It's not that great, even though it's not the worst film ever."
3,Almost fell asleep,"What a boring movie.

How can such a movie be rated that high? Will always be a secret to me."
8,"Sometimes it's too slow for my taste, but after all an enchaining story, with great characters.","First of all, it's been a while since I decided to watch The Godfather, but somehow I've never had enough will power to do so. I heard people saying it's the greatest movie of all time, but I was still being skeptical about this statement, as I couldn't imagine a movie with such long play time grabbing your attention all over it. When it started playing I could sense the outstanding feeling of the early 50's USA. It just felt natural to be part of this world, as we were born to it. The plot is not to be detailed, as it's one of the most famous movies, but I can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of course there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns, there are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with handsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We learn the rules of this world, without directly being taught each of them. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the Corleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive and feel realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting overwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more likely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done, no matter what the morals say. Yes, we can live the life of the Corleones, and that's a thing not every movie can provide. The Godfather is not the best movie of all time, not for me at least. But it surely worth watching, not just because it's a legend, but for why it has become a legend."
10,"Ill make him an offer, he cannot refuse","Aged head of the Corleone crime family, Vito Corleone has known peace and power through violence in his clandestine criminal dynasty. When fate intervenes and sends the family into turmoil, it is his most reluctant of sons who must take over the mantle of Godfather to not only keep his family alive but keep there power intact as well.

One of the most acclaimed masterpiece's of film history The Godfather is a visually stunning, beautifully performed and expertly crafted film. Bringing its viewer into 1940's New York the viewer can't help but feel as though it was actually filmed within that period. Based off the acclaimed novel by Mario Puzzo, Coppola directs some of the silver screens legends in some of their finest performances. Brando delivers in his most iconic role that will leave you wanting more after the final credits roll. Pacino in what many consider his break out role shows you, the viewer why he will become one of the best performers of a generation, and James Caan delivers in what many consider his finest performance of his career. Spawning two sequels and legions of fans worldwide, this classic has not only held the test of time but remains to this day one of the finest films every created. Anyone who considers themselves a true film buff needs to have seen this timeless classic."
10,Like the perfect meal,"I first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college, during a summer school class I was taking called ""Literature and Film."" This was the second film they showed, I think, and from the moment the character of Bonasera comes on and says, ""I believe in America,"" this had me hooked. This is like the perfect meal, where all the ingredients come together - theme (gangsters as a metaphor for society, family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics), story, acting (Brando seemed a little overrated when I first saw it, but that's because he's not on-screen a whole lot; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"") - and leave you completely satisfied. And the scene I remember is not the horse's head, or the scene where Michael says he will kill Sollozzo and McClusky, but rather the baptism scene, which haunted me for days. Incredible as it may seem, Part II is even better. But I'll say more about that in those comments."
10,God,"Although when it comes to movies Goodfellas prefer mafia, Godfather can not deny that's the best movie about the mafia, maybe the best movie ever made .An impeccable direction of Francis Ford Coppola's part and a great script based on the book Mario Puzo's (who is also co-author of the screenplay) make an excellent movie .Jocul nose is high-class actors, Marlon Brando makes perhaps the best role of his career, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall are excellent and roles but it is curious that none of them earned Oscar statuette going to Joel Grey in Cabaret role, but whatever, it is so decided Academy members, who we eventually his Godfather is a conclusion contestam.In excellent movie that I recommend to all, although I do not think there's anyone who has not seen .not 10 course."
10,n1,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Do not miss this film!"
10,one of the best drama movies,"did i hate any thing about this movie ?? no did i like any thing ?? yes indeed and i like the music it was great like magic you will like the story ,, for shore it long long movie , but you will wish it is never end ,, what about acting ?? it was great ,, i really wanna know how they can do such a great movie like this in that time ,, and also i wanna know how can the writers can write story like that deep i wish i can watch it in cinema or something like this ,, but take my advice ,, watch it alone because it long movie and you do not wanna any one to cut it on you ,, and i wish you enjoy it and pleas give some Attention please you will like for shore ,, about me ??? i like so much believe me you will hear it over and over and over"
9,Grate film,"If you're a filmmaker this is a must watch film, break it down to its smallest detail. cinematography and lighting is one of the best i've seen in any film, very inspiring! I would watch it over and over and over. do not be afraid to underexpose. great directing character, everything about this film is grate. production design is on point and so does all the other elements of the craft. after watching this film from a director of photography point of view you develop more ideas and become very passionate about the way you handle your shadows, it's unbelievable how they achieved this kind of accuracy of exposure latitude with the tools they had back then back in the film era. Inspired and motivated to go experiment with lighting on my own of this practical style. masterpiece."
7,Overrated,"No doubt a good movie, but to place it among the top ten is foolish. It hasn't introduced anything new at any cinematic level. Its influence on the living trends of cinema is practically zero (no interesting movie made after The Godfather owes anything to it). It's the paradigmatic example of what Fredric Jameson calls nostalgia cinema, a pastiche of the old conventions of gangster movies, a kind of funerary monument. Classical cinema ended long time ago (probably in the fifties), and this movie is just a well-done late survivor, a kind of aesthetic dinosaur."
5,What is all the fuss about?,I've watch this film trilogy but do not understand what all the fuss is about! There is nothing amazing or special this and I feel like I wasted time. I don't understand how it won Oscars either!
10,Movie of the Life Time,"This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers."
10,GREAT MOVIE,We ca n get a lot of learnings on this movie. This film works so well because it is an underworld in which its not that visible if you don't really watch the whole movie. There are other movies as well that are similar to this idea but this specific movie has a lot going on. Our team has provided this feedback and review because we think that this is a legendary film that was created and until now a lot of people are still watching it. You can compare different stories from different movies but this one is so unique that will really stick to your mind for a very long time/ I hope others enjoy it as well.
10,Nice Dream!,"From the first until the Last only the Best of All the Past

This is the Movie You cant forget it you never forget its name or those scene this is the shortest 3 hour movie its very short & very hard and soft. Only the best of best

best actors best director best writer only best of best. Plays of Marlon Brando is Awesome His is the sensitive hard man even word make you confuse.

Al Pacino, A hard strong man stone heart man that you could see the good in it And Fredo a big dumb brother !!! like hell in hell!!! Gather of these With Work of the Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo Make the best of best."
10,Best of the best,"It's not a movie, it's a living manual as a family man."
9,a family man,"The greatest film ever said by many. First film of the greatest trilogy ever said by many. I agree with second one, but not the first one. This is the greatest trilogy. And the first film is the pearl of that package. I drew my expectations extremely high before watching this classic. Unfortunately I had to fall. I didn't get the grain, that cutting-edge I was looking for. Fortunately the fall wasn't that high. I still liked the movie a lot. It was a great picture. A massive film in its genre. I like good mafia films. But I don't fancy them that much. But like I said, in its own genre this picture is a front runner.

The cast is the strongest part of the movie. Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) as The Godfather is like a fist to the eyehole. He is just so boss. At the same time he is so wise and calm. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and others give a very good contribution, but it is Marlon Brando who shines throughout the movie. The line 'the man who does not spend time with his family, is not a man' is epic.

There are lots of classic music in this movie. Some parts of the movie are in Italian. This is not your regular Hollywood movie. This is not that entertaining but still after seeing this, you'll probably say 'wow'."
10,A perfect movie,"Simply put The Godfather is the perfect movie. Coppola brings together a cast that delivers and a story thats timeless. I can watch this one over and over again it's something that hurt gets old and as an aspiring film maker one that makes me going. The film is a masterpiece of storytelling, with a gripping plot, memorable characters, and iconic scenes that have become part of cinema history. The themes of family, loyalty, and betrayal are expertly woven into the narrative, and the cinematography and score are both exceptional. In the end I can't wait to try to make a movie like this one in the future."
1,i hated it,"i hated it. the movie was so long and it was hard to follow. the sequels were OK. i feel that this movie was over rated way too much. so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just don't understand how that is possible. Marlon Brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront, A streetcar named desire, and don Juan Marco just to name a few. Pacino wasn't even that good. i much preferred him in Carlitos way and Donnie bras-co and who could forget Scarface. Pacino is getting typecast. i think the only reason he did Simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal. i have to say i can't blame him. Pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come on"
10,Must-see film. Completely great,"Probably the greatest film of all times. This film is, in my opinion, absolutely perfect: Coppola's best direction, fantastic photography, perfectly acted by all the cast, thrilling story...

This cinema classic is a must-see film, from the beginning to the end. There are lots of influences from the genre classics, but it is at the same time original and surprising.

Its violence is brutal but not just for fun, there is just the necessary to show the criminal world, which is perfectly represented here.

This film is so great you can watch it more than one time, and you're not going to get tired of it. You'll find even more details in every scene, so it's a perfect film to have at home, because yo'll enjoy watching it a lot of times. I recommend the Blu-ray edition, which is really good."
10,It is Legendary,"It is hard to explain how great a great movie with Great Actors along with excellent story and direction.

Godfather belongs to that type of movies which in any generation it is new and will be new and in one world it is forever is best film ever. Francis Ford Coppola successfully could shows mafia world to world in one movie!

Godfather was a signature on Marlon Brando's career and an approval signature on Al Pacino's career.

I am sure any one enjoys of watching this really great movie. Thank you so much Francis Ford Coppola Thank you... thank you. Any way I give 10/10 stars for this excellent movie so do not hesitate to watch it."
10,About the closest thing that 20th Century film came to Shakespearean scale tragedy,"The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2 represent a defining moment in cinema. Few films can claim to be such an integral element of modern film-making as Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's masterpiece that explores the downfall of a man born into the world of the Italian mafia. To describe either film as being perfect is not an overstatement in any means.

Coppola's mastery of direction is evident from the very beginning of the first film of the Godfather trilogy. The ""I Love America"" speech tells the audience exactly what they need to know about the world these characters inhabit, and the wedding that follows sets up all that is to befall ""the family"" over the course of the film. Coppola clearly demonstrates a true understanding of the delicate balance between the importance of camera work and the necessity of allowing master performers the latitude to develop their characters to the rich level they achieve.

When one combines a perfect script with perfect performances by some of the legends of film, all under the guidance of a director with a mature and tasteful sense of the art of film, the results are inspiring. The Godfather and the Godfather Part II are my favourite films of all time simply because they are the closest thing that the 20th Century ever produced to Shakespearean tragedy. They go beyond the clichés of Hollywood sentimentality and strike at the heart of what great drama is about: love, hate, the death of idealism under the weight of the world... and family."
10,Breathtaking,"One of the best movies of all time has in it's cast some of the best actors of all time , some of them already had been nominated or won the academy award and the others won it after their performance in this masterpiece. Let's not forget Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzzo who had a big role in this movie's success beside the actors performance. The movie shows almost every aspect of life switching from emotion to tragedy in a unique way , as the same with the characters witch is Michaels case , changing from a loving young man and uninterested of power to a man that is unflinching in his belief. That in one word : Breathtaking"
9,A masterpiece.,"A masterpiece of a movie with great cast, very good script, good acting and directing. It almost feels like you are in the movie the whole time and you stumble upon these emotions surrounding love, loyalty and systemic hierarchy.

The only thing about the movie I have a problem with is that it sometimes becomes very long-winded or boring in that sense, but if you have a good amount of time on your hands and a lot of snacks, it shouldn't be a problem at all.

A 9.5/10 from me."
6,"Looks good, has good acting... but number 1? Pfft.","Number one movie of all time? Come on there isn't much going

on here. It's strictly a movie for fans of ""actors"" and ""great casts,""

as evidenced by the many user reviews that fail to find anything

else to say about it.

The story's long and dull, unless you happen to be obsessed with

mafioso and the little details of Italain Americana of the period,

which I must admit it captures well. But there isn't really any soul

or mystery to this movie. It doesn't really even try to grapple with

any issues. (See Casablanca, or even Empire Strikes Back, and

you'll know what I mean. You wanna see Brando acting? ""On the

Waterfront."" Now that's a movie with heart!)

I think the real reason it stays ranked so high is that even people

that don't like it very much (like me) can't give it much lower than a

7 or 8, because it is so strong in its acting, cinematography, and

mise en scene. Whereas the (few) people who don't get

Casablanca find it so antique and alien that they feel free to vote it

down with 1s and 2s. A real shame, that I think even Coppola

would admit.

Oh, I'd even recommend Apocalypse Now over Godfather. There's

just so much more mystery and human story going on. Godfather's just about some violent stereotypes rehashed with a

""redeeming"" sense of ""Family Honor."""
1,Completely overrated,Fine if no one is saying anything I will this movie is overrated I understand why people THAT time (1970s) liked it back then it was something new and probably the most realistic movie they got back THEN but honestly there is SO MANY movies that are WAY better though I do understand why MEN liked it but honestly I've been watching movies from a very young age and this movie wasn't even mid it was low the idea is SO basic and old and yeah you will say it's an old movie in the 70s and that's why you need to let it go you just like it because it old and old fashioned how about you move on from OH THOESE WERE THE GREATER DAYS and start get nostalgic people who are like this need to move to actually better movies with better plot and actually more realistic in OUR time and honestly it was SO misogynistic and I just lost 3 hours of my life in trash.
10,Under a mask of corruption lies the face unity,"The Godfather, as so many before me, and so many after me will stipulate and emphasize is more than a family's way of life through crime. It not only projects the ironies, debacles, rises, falls and basic aspects of corruption but reveals the true meaning of family. Yes, it might seem odd and disturbing to allude to a people of invidious and ulterior principles to 'family', but when we characterize the word as an interface of love, commitment and connections through blood, no other type of portrayal is more symbolic than the Godfather. I will not bore and weigh my comment down through superfluous lines of the general story of the Godfather as so many others have done (and in better terms than I could possibly ever write). Rather, I will address a controversy which has spread amongst all fans of this enduring classic around the globe. In what way is the Godfather a reflection of family? Well.. to begin with the Corleones are family through blood. On a less literal level how does the Godfather epitomize the moral ethics of 'family'? The main component of a strong and progressive family is commitment. People may generally say 'Everyone knows that the most important part of a family is commitment', but this is where they are wrong. Most relationships in America are based on love or in a more ephemeral sense, infatuation. Commitment seems to be the more onerous and tedious part of love, simply because it is harder to sustain. In order to sustain a commitment one must be accustomed to routine. In order to get accustomed to routine it is imperative to have and hold an interest. Interest is where most love relationships break down because it simply cannot last. Most people are far too capricious to maintain an interest in anything (even as important as keeping a commitment in order to raise a family) for too long. This is where the forbearance of the Corleone family is outstanding. Through profitable business exploitation and singularly successful organized crime the Corleone's omnipotent infiltration of businesses often invoked anger in affiliate mafia groups seeking status elevation which ultimately resulted in the assassinations of Don Vito and Santino Corleon. Even at the breach of these two losses Michael Corleone readily steps up to the plate as the new Patriarch with rigor to supplant his former indifference. In just bloated proportions to 'ordinary' families in which commitment sacrifices time and money, commitment for the Corleones demands a greater sacrifice which is never too great for them to give. This is a sacrifice of life and security. Where the normal American family finds a sanction away from crime, the geography of their bounds is dwelled on by Corleones"
10,One of the greatest films ever made,"The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America/organised crime era like no other.

The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.

Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others. Everyone else is great, from Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda as Vito right hand men to John Cazale as the frail Fredo to Al Lettieri as the menacing Sollozzo to Diane Keaton as the gentle Kay.

The look of the film is fantastic, the cinematography is dark and dimly coloured which helps to reflect the era perfectly. The music is equally fabulous. The main theme is one of the most recognisable of all time and the music does carry an authentic Italian feel. The depth in which Coppola goes to study these characters has to applauded too, giving some of the most well developed characters on the big screen. The way they are different and sometimes polar opposites , the way Sonny lacks control and is aggressive whilst Michael is very much in control and distant. This fascinating aspect helps develop events greatly. The violence makes more sense here, it's done to shape the characters views and set off new events instead of just being there for the sake of it. That idea is what also elevates the film, everything is done for a reason and fits in perfectly with the story giving most of the events much more weight and meaning than usual. The film also excellently sets up events, such as Michael warning Fredo not to side against the family and the move to Nevada, that would be explored in part II.

There's not one bad thing about the whole film, one of the few films where that can be said. The Godfather remains incredibly gripping and intriguing all the way through thanks to the epic story, acting and directing."
10,A true masterpiece,"What can i say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, this film is a masterpiece it is a cinematic landmark, it is in my opinion, better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is great but this is such a more dramatic film. I love the beginning of this film when the undertaker is asking Vito Corleone for justice, it was such a beautifully shot scene i loved how Marlon Brando portrayed Vito it is one of if not his best performance (Apocalypse Now is his second) of his career. Te Godfather is in my top 10 films of all time and it will always will be no other film can change that. The Godfather will always be remembered as the greatest film of all time and will never be forgotten, i just love this film so much it actually was one of the inspirations that made me want to become a film director and I'm only 14, it made me actually made me appreciate film and i am glad i watched this even its sequel was amazing and is in my top 20 favorite films of all time but 3 was terrible it should have never had ever been made and i will stick by that as long as i live but i love Francis Ford Coppolas direction of the film it will never be forgotten."
10,A masterpiece,"I was initially cynical before watching this movie; I thought it would be hard for it to justify such a high average rating. Having now watched all three, the first Godfather is by far the best, and deserves the title of one of the 3 or 4 greatest movies of all time. The acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is incredible, and this movie has immersed me in the world and created a level of suspense and anticipation that I have not felt before with any other piece of cinema. Without spoiling any of the plot, the twists and turns and overall composition of the movie is spectacular; although it is 3 hours long, you end up never wanting it to end. I think a lot of credit needs to go to Mario Puzo for his incredibly intelligent plot in the first instance, and overall this is a must watch."
10,Hollywood's Finest,"The Godfather is in my opinion the second greatest movie of all time. The pacing is flawless, the acting is absolutely mesmerising and the story is the most ""simply complicated"" one ever. Brando and Pacino were a match made in heaven for their characters and no movie will ever reach the pinnacle like The Godfather did. Stunning brilliant.

10,Dream classic movie,"Few movies that get my attention and makes me day dream about, and Godfather i,ii, and iii sure does that to me. I would lay in bed, office, or school and think about some memory moments during the movie, i.e., ""oof maroon only if I can have the bag of money"" as it is truly one of the many best moments in Godfather during the wedding, the driver for the Godfather wished he can rob the bag of money gifts which had all cash in it.

Honestly, all mob movies make me and gets me so excited as it always has and always will. There is this special connection I really can't figure out what it really is, but for what its worth its there. If you watch mob movies and those that are classic you can relate to what am saying. All and all Godfather will always stay in a special place in my heart and my kids future. As I will make sure my son watches it as soon he turns 18. Because it has real, true, manly life lessons we can all learn a few things from. As movies inspire us but doesn't define us.

love the movie."
6,overrated beyond belief,I didn't care for any of the Godfather films. I think they're some of the most overrated films of all time. Boring. I hate mafia movies. I think Donnie Brasco was better. I think The Conversation is a far superior film from Coppola.
3,"I'm Sorry, Not Worth the Hype","I don't know why everybody who loves this film loves it so much. Maybe the fact everybody hyped it up meant i was never going to fully enjoy this but to be honest, it seemed slow and confusing and i struggled to keep my concentration. Constantly, i found myself drifting off and daydreaming. I would have stopped watching but i had a Uni assignment on it.

It has some great scenes but everybody has seen them before anyway. The acting is good but I thought Al Pacino has been better in other things.

Also, it was hard to make out, the characters speak so quietly it just turns into background noise.

It's not the worst film I've ever seen, no way. but it certainly isn't in the top 10, not even close.

The game is better, you get all the good scenes without the fairly dull bits in between."
10,Simply the best. Against which all other films should be measured,"I must have seen this film 20 times and I will probably see it 20 times more, it is that good.

Why is this? First of all the story is exceptional, almost Shakespeareian and Machiavellian in it's scope and subject. Although the film is about the succession struggle and rise of an American-Italian Mafia Don against the background of gang warfare it is very reminiscent of the stories of European Renaissance Princes. Complete with assassinations, political intrigue, war and cold hearted iron will. Also compared to other films there happens an awful lot in this movie, so much so in fact that I tend to forget half of it which enhanced the 'see it again' factor, because I can't quite remember exactly what happened next.

The second reason why this movie is exceptional are the acting performances which are truly amazingly good across the board. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are all great, but so are the all the lesser supporting actors. This is all further helped by the very believable dialog between the characters, the pace and direction of the movie which keeps the suspense up and things going along nicely. Also the social drama with the sister, wife and brothers is really engaging. The balance is also good between moments of relative quiet leading up to moments of action and terror. Great cinematography and production values to boot . Highly entertaining viewing all round. You can't ask for more.

Highly Recommend."
9,The 2nd best Mafia movie,"I'm sure you may want to argue with me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This is a terrific movie on many levels. Pacing, Script, Lighting, Sets, Everything is top notch before you even get to the superb acting. This film demonstrates the ability to show violence in a shocking way and some people used it as a normal function of business. If you want to know what my #1 mob movie is...see Miller's Crossing. This is the best of the Godfather trilogy. Another bone you'll probably have to pick sometime. My favorite thing about the movie is probably the sets and locations. Choosing a favorite line is difficult. I appreciate the relative small use of profanity. ""He's been struck by the thunderbolt"""

10,The greatest film ever made next to the sequel.,"Much of my male wisdom and philosophy on life is derived from THE GODFATHER. It is one of the most powerful, poetic, dramatic, stories in history, elevated from pulp to high art by a brilliant ensemble cast, mythical direction and a riveting script. Brando is forever enshrined by his performance as Don Vito head of the powerful Corleone crime family. Al Pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the Don's son Michael, who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene. It is a comment on the fallibility of the American dream. How every good boy has the capacity for bad. Every character resonates with authenticity. Every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family. THE GODFATHER above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family. It is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll. When loyalty was ensured through family connections, and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government. A film that is truly epic in scope, and all encompassing in wisdom. A masterpiece."
10,The Godfather,The Godfather is one of my top ten favorite films.
10,The best,"One of the best movies of all time! The acting. The directing. The production. The writing... just gets to you. I could never get tired of watching this movie! This movie makes you feel like you're part of that world. Francis Ford Coppola will always be considered one of the best auteur's in cinema! Al Pacino and especially Marlon Brando are superb! The score of the film is legendary. And, How Marlon Brando delivers his lines is just chilling of how amazing it is. I seriously, which that movies can be this good in our day and age! Movies are not like this anymore and movies these days are about franchise and blockbuster hits. Sad, how Hollywood thinks about money, it's show business, and key word ""business."" But, THE GODFATHER, is true cinema!"
7,The Godfather: 7/10,"I hate reviewing classic movies, since most have a reputation and I feel like I'm not an actual moviegoer/critic if I don't like the classics or give them a certain rating. Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it.

In Francis Ford Coppola's Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a famous family mafia. The film goes through their various escapades as a crime family.

I really, really enjoyed watching The Godfather. The almost-three-hour runtime seemed to fly by. I was enthralled by the sincerity of the acting and the horrible true-to-life feel of the film. All of the acting was dead-on, although some of the screaming could have been a little better. With up-and-coming stars at the time such as Al Pacino, how can you go wrong?

However, with all movies, they can't be perfect. The film could, or should, have had more plot to it. I know it's supposed to be ""a day in the life of"" type movie, but if it had been with one adventure for most of the way it would have helped. Also, there were lots of supporting characters who we can't remember about for three hours. If that wasn't enough, all of the characters looked like either tall or fat white men with thick Italian accents, making them hard to understand (and of course I had to rent the VHS version so I couldn't read subtitles). More towards the end, I couldn't tell who was on whose side. The ending could have been trimmed down a little; the last half hour or so seemed to actually be boring and not very exciting. Maybe Coppola put it in there so the movie could have the designation of being ""one of those long classics"".

I was surprised about how little strong language there was for a crime movie like this. I would have guessed all the characters to be swearin' like a sailor, but I was surprised. The amount of blood didn't surprise me, but I commend Coppola for putting so much in.

Pacino looked like he does now, minus bags under his eyes. Brando gained about 200 pounds after The Godfather. And, Abe Vigoda looks exactly the same as he did thirty years ago. Yes, that's right. Abe Vigoda is in this movie. Hurray!

The Godfather is an entertaining movie that is overrated but still fun to watch as three hours pass.

My rating: 7/10

Rated R for strong violence, blood, brief nudity, and constant but mainly minor profanity."
2,an overrated terrible movie,"let's give it a good estimation

entertainment: it's been said many times that the acting is stupid , including Brando's character just mumbling and Pacino's character just ,well, staring.. truly over-hyped junkie so called acting.the script is bad , it's like a Mexican soap drama. the dialog is below the standard of those Indian cheese. the production value is fair though , shot in Sicily. it seems the producer is not interested in faking locations. overall rating 3/15

social/life message: the isn't a particular deep movie. isn't anywhere better than any eurocrime pic. the message is banal: criminals have souls.- rating 0/10

politically objectionable things : nothing big really, as I said the director/writer seems to be obsessed with organized crime, he hardly delivers any political or historical material. rating is high 3/5

overall rating: two out of ten"
9,The Godfather is An Offer No Audience Can Refuse!,"The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema.

Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather constructs a sprawling family saga that tells the story of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the spider at the center of a web of deceit, murder and larceny. When the Don is left incapacitated by an attempted assassination from a rival crime family, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence and it is left up to his sons - the hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted Irish son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino) - to run the Corleone clan. Hardened by the reprisals taken against his family, the 'white-sheep' son Michael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare, which hints at the beginning of his moral descent. Thus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by death's hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions. But, underneath all the slayings and sinister ""offers you can't refuse"" this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honor.

The Godfather has a richly operatic feel to it, thanks to the solemn and stately classicism that Francis Ford Coppola brings to his pulpy material. He doesn't waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. The artistry of Coppola combined with Gordon Willis' spot-on cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score covers many scenes in a deep veil of shadow, ensconcing the audience in an atmosphere of unconditional involvement.

Each performance is a vignette that fits exquisitely into the whole picture. The character of Vito exhibits the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a staggering mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Brando's restrained motions and rasping speech patterns are stunningly suggestive of power while his actions (courtesy of the script) wield it. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. As Vito's hesitant son, Pacino rises to the occasion admirably. He beautifully underplays Michael's evolution from returning war hero to the new head of the Corleone family. Caan, gives a splendid portrayal as the hot-headed Sonny while Robert Duvall is steadily efficient as Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton is just right as Michael's oblivious love Kay.

The Godfather will continue to hold a central place in cinema history, an epic which has colored everything made subsequently with its imagery and operatic scope. An enduring masterpiece!"
10,Quality vs. Entertainment,"People lately have been having heated debates about TDK and the Godfather. Which is better? Everyone has their opinion, and I start my review with a Latin proverb: De Gustibus non Disputandum est. This means you can't argue with taste.

My opinion is that the godfather is a movie of great quality, however, there are other movies, TDK, for instance which are more entertaining.

Its similar to how in high school, they make you read all those dreadful ""classics"" To Kill a Mockinbird, Fahrenheit 451, The Great Gatsby, Macbeth, Hamlet... etc. Even though Harry Potter might be exponentially more exciting than this list of classics, it doesn't have that much literary value. Was it an enjoyable read? Of course. But I won't be telling my grandkids all the lessons harry potter taught me."
10,CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!,"If you wanna define this movie in a word, it would simply be 'Masterpiece', ridiculously flawless and extraordinary. The Godfather isn't a movie, but a piece of art, which make you feel the characters and their emotions, everytime they appear on screen. The screenplay and direction, both are simply flawless, intriguing, charismatic and definitive. The characters are very well written and potrayed in the most delicate way. The Original Score for the movie is gorgeous and bridges between characters and their emotions. It is simply the best score I have ever heard till date in a motion picture. In a movie with deep characters along with a great story, the performances by actors are marvelous. Al Pacino, Brando everyone is awesome giving life to the story. For a movie, about 3 hrs long, The Godfather provides edge of seat experience.

7,ITS OVERHYPED!!!,I watched it 2 times and still dont see why people are so obsessed with this movie. There's nothing extraordinary about this film.
1,"The banality of evil, and of this movie","Certainly the most massively overrated movie of all time. I finally saw it today, out of sheer curiosity, after avoiding it for so long. I usually avoid movies involving the mob, true crime, horror, or overly violent movies- but I wanted to see what the fuss was all about.

I still don't understand. I am reminded of Hannah Arendt's expression ""The banality of evil"", which she coined after observing Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in 1961. To her, Eichmann seemed to be a common man, evidenced in his transparent superficiality and mediocrity- ""not stupidity but a curious, quite authentic inability to think."" Critical thinking especially. Perhaps I am predisposed to feel this way, growing up in an intellectual family with high moral standards- evil is quite boring to me. I was originally going to rate this 2/10, and then I found out the actress who did the only nude scene, in one of the few hopeful periods of the movie for one of our main characters, was only 16 at the time. Eww. Legal then but not legal now.

Still don't understand what the fuss is about."
10,Absolute masterpiece,"One of my absolute favourite films. It's hard to say something that hasn't already been said and it's even harder to explain why this movie is just so perfect. From the acting, setting, script, tone, charecters everything just feel perfect. It's one of those amazing once in a blue moon created movies that just nailed everything it set out to do.

We follow the Corlione mob family. After the leader of the gang Vito says no to deal with narcotics, he ends up starting and all out war. His son, Michael, takes over the family business, a life he really didn't want.

Let's start with the small praises and work towards the strongest aspects of this movie. The soundtrack is beutifull and used to perfection. It's sparingly and uses the same motive to nearly everything. It really helps elevate so many scenes.

The production design is also so good. It's not in the big blockbuster ways, but the small things. All the suits and clothing looking amazing and iconic. The light and camera work creating so many amazing moodful scenes and dynamics. The colour leading that feels nearly subliminal. It's a production with so much control and is so well thought out you have to give it credit.

The plot is absolutely amazing. It creates this complicated yet tight story that is executed to perfection. It understands your smart and can follow a plot with a million moving parts without over explaining everything. The plot is also compelling and told so beautifully. Every scene and line feels like they have a purpose and it creates this masterclass in how to storytell.

One of the final sequences in particular is one of my favourites ever put to the screen. It would be a spoiler but it envovles a baptism. It's just one scene, but so many scenes and sequences are edged into my mind as iconic.

And what carries all of the above? The amazing production and plot? The amazingly written chatecters. Every single charecter feels like a person where you know everything about them. Even the once with nearly no screentime. You feel invited into the mob lifestyle and you feel invited into the Corleone family. Everyone becomes these people you love and hate and the lines and scenes between everyone adds everything to the movie. I could litually highlight every single preformance here. So instead of just list names you already expect me to praise know they are here and remember everyone else that deserve praise too. The lines are all iconic and presented by Thier respect actor beutifully. It's almost amazing how so many lines feel nearly poeticly written with so much force, emotion and power behind him.

This movie is about one charecter in particular, Micheal Corleone. He is the chatecter portrait that makes this movie so compelling and tragic. It is showing a charecter sink further and further down a whole he had avoided for sutch a Long time. His character arc is both one of the most satisfying and tragic arcs ever put to the screen.

This movie is just amazing from start to finish. Every just work to pure perfection. Acting, script, production. All held to it's ansulolute peek."
10,A classic!,"This is a classic film and the actors are truly amazing. An epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Thanks to RT and other reviewers."
10,Greatest gangster movie ever !,"It's the best movie i have seen in my entire acting carrer. Marlon Brando is indeed the best choice for the role of the Godfather.It's a shame dough he dies in the end.

Great Movie.

Watch,buy the DVD Collection !

MSG yea that's me if u wanna know who i b

2Pac G-Unit Eminem 50 Cent The BEst YO long live Rap

Yo if u like this movie u should watch

''The Matrix'' ;) oh boy im bored what else do i have to write on this comment all i wanted was a short one but no have to write an essay over here because people like to read a lot actually some do............depending on what it is"
8,in short awesome.....,"Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I don't care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn't change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadn't seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic.

The film is really stunning in the way every demise happens momentarily, and as it compasses ten years such a variety of distinctive things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary stimulation. It's a well- made and enthralling film that is just the first piece of a set of three, yet it remains all alone as a superb film in its own particular right. On the off chance that you haven't seen it, what are you holding up for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't baffle."
10,The Godfather,Perfect acting Al Pacino.Professional casts. Thank You
10,Just what everyone needs: another 10/10 review of The Godfather,"The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the ""my opinion"" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I ""appreciate"" whilst not particularly ""enjoying.""

But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene...

... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I ""had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled""... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing.

We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly.

Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course).

Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside).

If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too.

Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime."
10,Godfather of all movies,"What a movie, the godfather of all movies for ever!! I love this movie, the plot, the actors, everything. Al Pacino as a young boy starting to take his fathers place. The Italian customs, the cast. From the beginning tot the end: truly fantastic! I see this movie every year and it keeps getting better. Suspense, Humor, Action, Great Characters and so on. Greatest movie ever made! Of course the movie is part 1, part 2 and part 3. But I must say part 1 is my favorite part. Swichting form Sicily to America is brilliant. With my friends we recently had an Italian night, with Italian food and wines. Watching this movie we make jokes and start imitating the characters: ""act like a man!"" Hehe, great!"
6,"Boring movie, 6/10 for direction and acting, story missing at all","How this movie has to be #1 is a mystery, then I see that Lord of Rings is #5 and I understand. Just think people rated this movie #1 cause other did it. A kind of conformism. The story is completely non-sense. What's the deal in a mafia family's revenge? Good actors don't mean good movie, good director doesn't mean good movie. If the story lacks then direction and acting are worthless. This movie is BORING! There's no emotional scene in all movie, oh well if you except the horse in the bed. There's anyway some funny moments, as the way are pictured the mafia guys in Sicily, really outdated. Lol Make a favour to yourself, this movie is almost 3 hours long, add another hour and watch to ""Once upon a time in America"", a real epic tale on gangster. This Godfather was a big disappointment :("
1,"A good movie, however not worthy of its top ranking","When a prestige movie is made, utmost attention is given to detail, grandeur, style, and above all, popularity. Godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of Mario Puzo, who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster/mobster. Capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable: to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls, and that they are certainly not invincible. This movie was what it was meant to be, a prestige movie, it took very few risks, and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters.

I found the Godfather to be a very well done movie. In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much that I have watched it on many occasions. This movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me, and it tells its story very well. However, I do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the Top 100 ranking. The highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee. The godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies.

People go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives. To be transported to another world, life, place, or perspective. The godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement. Not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves. There is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real, and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away. To those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies, the Godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time'.

Movies such as Moulin Rouge, Citizen Kane, Requiem for a Dream, the Matrix, Casablanca, Momento, and even (depending on the viewer) Gladiator, all grasp the viewer by their hair, and thrust them into another world, if for only a few seconds. The movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world. It leaves us in a feeling of awe, and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie, but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen, and in some unique cases, a journey into the great depths of our own minds. With this sort of depth and greatness, these types of movies should be all in the top 10.

This unique greatness is not easily achieved. In order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way, a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie. The climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie, and should thus create a `climatic experience', thus blowing the viewer away. The Godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking.

So it is therefore obvious that The Godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies, and so it is not deserving of its top ranking. If it were up to me, I would move the Godfather down to 5 or 6, and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated.

This movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10"
10,A TRUE MARVEL,"I have been watching movies since last 35 years but have never been drawn more to a movie that can influece you to make your own film. Thats what made me a film maker to be honest. Reading Mario Puzos Godfather and seeing how it translated onto the silver screen told me how the writer in me could become the person who can visualize.

Cinematography, Editing, Direction, Acting and all the other Crafts that make it a 24 craft game are explained in this movie as to why you need all 24 crafts to be perfect. To make a masterpiece.

Godfather has been adapted by thousands or filmmakers which made a few great and a few legends, but there is no movie like the GodFather. Storaro at his very best, Brando at his prime, Al pacino in his element brought it all for the Director and the studio make their dream come true. One of those very rare must watch classics."
10,Excellent,"I really like this movie because i like the godfather name it makes me to watch this movie.The best movie i have ever seen I have seen only Godfather I but its amazing.The twist in the movie is the death of Godfather(father of Michel Corleone) while playing with his grandson Excellent Movie Gonna watch this movie again.... :)

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
10,what a great film,"perfect, real perfect. when i watch this film, i fell it whole my body. and Al Pacino acts unimaginable. thank you Coppola. All the people that like watching movies all over the world, know THE GODFATHER. and nearly all of them say that it is the best film i have ever seen. Marlon Brando acts one of the best acts of movie history. for me Al Pacino acts the best of best all times. Mario Puzo wrote the best story and Francis Ford Coppola directed great. so it is the best really best. Everybody want to watch films near real life. The Godfather is real. you can feel it. i wish all the film like just The Godfather. Thanks all."
9,And Now for Something Completely Different!,"I saw this film (at the theater) as a kid in the 70' upon its initial release. And, of course, was impressed. Marlon Brando is my favorite actor and I like all other actors in the film. Everything in this movie is just great (anybody noticed Gordon Willis' work?).

I can understand why all the fine young Americans consider this to be the best movie in the history. It's American (it seems that nobody knows that cinema exist ""also"" outside the USA, in fact a 100 years of great art of film-making), it's ""kill-kill-kill"" (main theme in American movies), it's about family (another main theme), it's entertaining (nothing to think about, let's go to the movies, have fun, popcorn and stuff) and so on.

The fact is that The Godfather is a great American movie for Americans. I like very well made films and I like this movie, but it is still ""just"" a MOVIE.

If you are among those who consider this movie the best in the history, you should start watching the real great ones, masterpieces that can teach you something about yourself or even change your life.

Ever heard of Kurosawa, Bunuel, Tarkovski, Bergman, Fellini? Not to mention American directors (if you hate 'foreign' films, forgot to read subtitles etc.): Welles, Kubrick, Altman, Lumet... And the Japanese (Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinugasa), Chinese, British (Schlesinger, Russell, Parker, Greenaway) and so on and so on.

Please, go and educate yourself. Your mind, heart and soul will thank you for that. All you need is to be curious and open-minded.

I consider myself lucky to have a chance to see at least 100 'better' films (in every aspect) than The Godfather. And I have still a long way to go. Good luck to you all in your 'search' for the art of cinema.

My vote for The Godfather: 9/10."
10,How rare a pearl.....,"This is a film--it's too dignified to call it a movie--that shatters things we usually take for granted about the genre. Movies are never as good as the books on which they're based--but this one is. Films about Italians always wallow in stereotypes--but this one doesn't. All-star epics always disappoint--but this one doesn't.

Pacino is truly amazing to watch as he gets drawn into the family business, and Brando's best scene is, oddly enough, his final one, where he's playing with his grandson. This is a man who's ordered countless deaths, beatings, etc., but to a small child, he's just Grampa, and he's the most wonderful grownup in the whole wide world.

If you've never seen this movie, you're doing yourself an injustice. Get it, see it, experience it."
9,THE BEST,"There is no doubt in my mind concerning the fact that The Godfather is the best movie of all time. From the flawless directing to the powerful acting, this movie is a must for every home video collection. Even today this movie still has the elements of surprise and shock which the majority of older movies no longer hold. Who could ever forget the memorable horse head scene. How the AFI ranked this movie number three still baffles me to this day. Coppola put his best forward and left all others behind."
8,best film,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.

The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.

The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.

""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises."
10,The offer that you cannot refuse,"The Vito had shown his outstanding leadership in the movie. Quite learn a lot from him!Especially the quotes came out from his mouth. The bad-temper Sonny, weak Fredo and calm Michael have shown us the characters of human being. The godfather is not a easy job. He is a leader and must always take care to each other. He need to be fair and discipline.The traitors must be executed even though you are the family members.Really hard to be a godfather. By the way, I vote this movie 10 for the Marlon Brando!Thanks."
6,Far too overrated...,"In other words it is not the greatest film of all time. I cannot stand people who have claimed it to be. It is no where as a good as Shawshank, Alien and definitely is not, and never will be, as good as Taxi Driver. It does have its moments and Al Pacino was brilliant, (no I'm not going to give Marlon Brando a shout out, because he too is overrated) the music is stunning and so is the story but it isn't very catching I had to space the viewing over a number of days because I couldn't be arsed watching all at once without felling the urge to watch something else. It rises well but then falls flat on to its face then slowly makes it to it's knees towards the end. Yet I still find it hard to believe how it is the 'best' film ever.

F.Nich"
1,Almost nothing,A film about post war US life. Maybe I was tired while watching it but anyway I was disappointed. Nothing more than gangster movie at all. Marlon Brando is excellent though... I`m not going to say that it`s chicken-feed but from my point view it has artificially created reputation. La Piovra - italian tv-series is much better in every point.
10,It stands the test of time,"I was happy to see this on one of the cable channels the other day and we watched it. There was nothing dated about it. There we no special effects, no cookie cutter acts and scenes. It was a relief.

A friend of mine, whose father left home when my friend was a little boy, adopted The Godfather as his missing dad. He watched it 25 times and quoted it throughout his life as the voice of a loving father who takes care of business. In a way it is scary, but also an amazing thing, that a film can raise a man.

This movie has held the number one spot on my top ten list for most of my adult life. Western culture will remember it like we remember the works of Verdi, Rembrant and Shakespeare.

Coppola can make all the wine he wants. He's earned it."
10,"No words, just admire","Since 1972 lots of words have been said. I think that there are just 2 options: -or you let me write nineteen full books about that, -or you better watch it, even if you think it is not your kind of film. Just watch it. It's really the top. Just a little of it i can say, just like a mirror. It is the top about Marlon Brando working. Even better than his acting in Apocalypse now or...anything else... You can understand it above all in the interview released in the post production period. Some of the particulars which made his character such complete, have been just an intuition of Marlon Brando or Francis Ford Coppola. This thing has been taken like an example for all the cast and... that's the result."
10,the god father!!!,I think this the best movie after shawshank rademption this movie has marlon brando and al pacino and There is nothing left to say!!!
10,The most complete film of all time. Contains all elements of the art.,"This is hands down the greatest movie of all time. Great story. Great thematic elements. Great acting. Great cinematography and editing. Fabulous. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, Talia Shire...perhaps the greatest cast ever assembled."
10,"Brando, Pacino and Deniro at their best.","The Godfather is a not just a film but its a movement, it defines the past of the Italian American culture. A past that many American Italians are ashamed of but a past that I think the American people should know about. Any Italian could tell you that the principles of family that are portrayed in this film reflect the traditions of the old country. Family comes first before anything, this is a value that is passed down from generation to generation in the Italian culture, it was good to see that Coppola portrayed this in such a strong manner. It takes filming to a whole new level and changed the way we see films. Brando, Deniro and Pacino are genius! The acting compliments the impeccable work of Francis Ford Coppola. In my books this is a must see film, the book is not so bad either. The work of Coppola makes a long film seem like minutes."
10,its a great film,When I first saw this movie I was 15 years old and I liked it so much that since then I have watched it like 15 times. the performances and soundtrack are very good. the other two films in the trilogy are also good but don't beat the first. if you like the genre of gangsters you have to see this classic
10,The Godfather: A Timeless Masterpiece of Cinema,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1972, this adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel has become a cornerstone of cinematic history, lauded for its impeccable storytelling, masterful direction, and unforgettable performances.

The film chronicles the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia dynasty in 1940s New York. At the heart of the narrative is Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who reluctantly steps into the role of family patriarch, transitioning from a war hero to a ruthless crime boss. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the aging don whose influence looms large over the film.

Coppola's direction is nothing short of brilliant. He weaves a complex tale of power, loyalty, and betrayal with a deft hand, creating a richly textured world that feels both epic and intimate. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing characters and relationships to develop organically, drawing the audience deep into the Corleone family's universe.

Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a triumph. Cinematographer Gordon Willis, known as the ""Prince of Darkness,"" employs a striking use of shadows and light, creating a mood that is both haunting and beautiful. The film's production design and period detail further immerse viewers in its setting, making the 1940s and 1950s come alive with authenticity.

The performances in ""The Godfather"" are universally outstanding. Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, blending gravitas and vulnerability in a way that defines the character. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant son to the calculating head of the family is both subtle and powerful, marking a career-defining performance. The supporting cast, including James Caan as the hot-headed Sonny and Robert Duvall as the loyal consigliere Tom Hagen, add depth and nuance to the story.

Nino Rota's score is another standout element, with its haunting, melancholic themes perfectly underscoring the film's emotional and dramatic beats. The music has become as iconic as the film itself, instantly recognizable and evocative of the film's themes.

""The Godfather"" is more than just a crime saga; it is a profound exploration of family, power, and the American Dream. Coppola's adaptation retains the novel's depth while infusing it with cinematic artistry. The film's influence on both the gangster genre and cinema as a whole is immeasurable, setting a standard for storytelling and character development.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece that remains as compelling today as it was upon its release. Its blend of superb direction, unforgettable performances, and powerful storytelling makes it an essential viewing experience. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the twentieth, it never fails to captivate and inspire.

10/10 stars."
6,Doesn't deserves 9.2,"I don't think this movie deserves 9.2. It is a boring family drama movie, no doubt the actors were one of the best but overall the movie is super bore and normal crime/drama movie. But again I'll say the cast was superb. Just see shawshank redemption, it's a masterpiece and godfather just doesn't deserve to be so close to shawshank"
3,Not a great film,"I watched this film because it had a high user rating. I don't get why people find it a good film. For me, it was just a film about people, a family, killing other people. I couldn't take much more away from it than that, sorry. Shawshank is a much better film in every respect. The Godfather is long and drawn out and although it is one of the better gangster films, I would have to say that it is not one that I will watch again. Please let there be someone that agrees with me. From the reviews that I have read there doesn't seem to be a good reason to suggest why this film is voted number one, something that really puzzles me. There are no twists, little to think about, and the film hardly makes you feeling better at the end of it, does it? I've seen much better films than the Godfather although I'm sure, as I seem to be going against popular opinion, I will get heavily criticized for these comments."
10,greatest movie,I dont know what to say it s great you should watch it
10,Great Movie,I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined. i love how the scenes are laid out. i love old movies and I love romance films mixed with thriller. So this is definitely one of my all time favorites. I would recommend it to anyone young and old. There are some intense scenes as well. I would love to one day be in a movie sort of like this. But it would add such a flavor that people wouldn't expect it. I also like the idea of a super natural being who has many sides that we haven;t fully figured out. I am a movie lover and this is by far one of my favorites. I think when creating my own trailer I want to take small hints of sadness and hope like this film and include it in mine
10,Superb but Part 2 even better,"Marlon Brando's stunningly rich and complex portrait is just one of the many perfections this modern classic has to offer. But--Part 2 is bigger, better, richer, and better in every way. Not to diminish what a stunning achievement this film is. One perfectly realized scene flows after another, building one on top of the other. A moment of family and togetherness here, a crescendo of violence there, betrayal, duty, honor. It follows most of the rules established in early 30's gangster films like Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar but is not limited in what it can show and attempts to tone down the melodramatics to a more realistically paced level. Nearly flawless. Some of the finest casting and ensemble acting you will ever see in a film by a brilliant director at the top of his craft. It makes no apologies for forcing you to care deeply for characters who are violent, selfish, greedy criminals. It makes us believe that at times there really is honor among thieves. Somehow these people's class system seem fairly acceptable to us--though ultimately cruel, and doomed to end violently. An essential film. On of the top 50 films of all time to be sure."
10,Can a better movie be ever made... :-),"What a masterpiece... ! My love and respect for the actors brings me here after 43 years of the film release. I think i am a terribly late entry into the fan club of this classic. Still I would say that even in 2015, this movie had a grip over me from start to end and left me with a hangover of its signature soundtrack.

That's what make it a timeless classic i guess.. !

The performances by all the actors are great. After you see the movie you have this feeling that ""can a better movie be ever made ?"" It is 100% craft. Best performance is that of Marlon Brando. You just cant ask for anything more.

A must watch before you die. :-)"
10,Movie Classics,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in my opinion one of the best American film ever made and The greatest gangster film ever made. The Godfather is worldwide avowed as one of the greatest films in world cinema.

The film is about the importance of Mafia family life, the relationship between a father and his sons, power, loyalty, envy, corruption and succession all underscored by composer Nino Rota's iconic music.

The Film makes Deep impression onlooker, you're Watching a movie and you are indebted to the mafia life.

Great Movie, Great Cast, Great Director, Great Coposer...!!!"
10,My Favorite Film,"The Godfather was one of the first ""classic"" films I ever watched, and even after viewing other highly regarded films (On the Waterfront, Raging Bull, Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Third Man) it remains my favorite. Although it may not be the greatest film of all time (that honor goes to Citizen Kane), there will always be a special place in my heart for The Godfather. The seamlessness of the story and the richness of the distinct characters make it such an enjoyable film to watch that I am in awe every time I view it. I have watched it in whole or in parts dozens of times, and it is simply one film that I will never tire of."
6,Most overrated movie ever,"I do not understand the hype and legacy this movie enjoys. This is an average film at best, and if i had to choose a better mob movie then i would go with Goodfellas every time.

The film follows two story lines. There's Marlon Brando as ""Don Corleone"" and his dealings with the organized crime business. And then there is Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" and his decent into the business, and how it corrupts and transforms him into a monster. You would think that by this description the movie must be tense, and interesting right? Well your wrong. The movie is boring, drawn out, and lacks any tension, or excitement. Not only that but i don't know if i was so bored that i just missed half the dialogue, or if it was never there to begin with. I was perpetually confused by the stuff happening in this movie because I wasn't getting any info as to what the characters were doing, or what was being set up.

If you really like mobster movies then by all means watch this film and talk about how awesome it is, but beyond that just look for a better movie, because there are a lot of them."
1,"If there was such thing as a good mob movie, this is it.","I hate mob movies and even though this is a classic, the genre means it is less than desirable. Mob movies have one thing in common: they are SLOW! Their main theme is character development and the characters they develop are not worth knowing."
10,Sets the standard for family dramas!,This is a movie where everything seemed to come together. Great cast. Film score on point. The sets are very well done. The story is compelling. A truly iconic film!
10,"No Words Can Describe How Good This Movie Is (Except for ""Flat-Out Amazing"")","When I first went into this movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Sure, it often was on the top of lists of the Greatest Films Ever Made, but that was likely to create nearly-impossible hype. (Which had previously caused disappointment upon my first viewing of ""Citizen Kane"") I had previously found the movie in an article called ""Movies You Hate the First Time but Love the Second."" And it was also three hours long, so it would definitely have its slow scenes. (I was only able to make through the first 90 minutes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"") Cautiously, I turned the movie on. And within minutes, all my doubts disappeared.

For those of you who haven't seen it, ""The Godfather"" is the story of Michael Corleone, the son of Vito Corleone, a powerful Mafia boss. He initially tries to distance himself from the family business as much as possible, but he slowly gets drawn in, until his father passes control of the family down to him. So what is it about this movie that makes it such a classic? (""Everything"" would be too obvious and brief, so I'll try to go into more detail.)

The best part of this movie is, of course, the acting. Marlon Brando is fantastic as Don Vito, so obviously he really deserved his win of the Best Actor Oscar. (Although he infamously refused the award as a protest against Native Americans' portrayals in film) He really sells the fact that he is a powerful man, but also isn't as bad as one would think, and just cares about the family. Al Pacino as Michael is excellent in all his subtlety, as he goes through his transformation from a really nice guy into the ruthless head of the family. (Although from what I've heard, he goes even further in Part II, which I have yet to see) Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's girlfriend really manages to stand out in her supporting role despite being surrounded by amazing screen legends in the main roles. James Caan as Sonny is fantastic, Robert Duvall as Tom is great, Richard S. Castellano as Clemenza is just as good, I could go on forever, but I need to finish this up.

Another great part of the movie is the script, (Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo) which wisely knows to focus on and develop the characters, which are very well aided by the fine performances of the cast. The film lets us spend a lot of time with these characters until we feel we know them as well as our own family. (Okay, not QUITE that far, but you get the idea) The way the script handles these characters is brilliant: Despite the fact that they are in the Mafia, they are not necessarily evil. The movie spends a lot of time with them, and they seem like really nice people. (Well, except for the other families) And whenever the characters tell a story, because of how interesting the script makes the characters and their stories, all you have in your head is that story, and it even feels like its own movie.

The film has a really memorable score by Nino Rota; it doesn't have to be big or bombastic, it doesn't need to have a bunch of choir members singing frantically, it is more relaxed and melancholy. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is really beautiful, with plenty of shades of orange that perfectly complement the violence and gore of the different murders throughout the film. (Which aren't terribly brutal, but definitely for ages 14 and up) And the film is pretty well edited as well: Despite its long length, it rarely feels like it is three hours long, and when it occasionally slows down, those moments are really far between, and fairly brief. The only real complaint I have about the movie is that some things happen that I felt could have been explained a little more, but that's just me nitpicking.

So overall, ""The Godfather"" is flat out amazing, I can't compliment this movie enough. Nearly everything about it is perfect, I give it a 10/10.

(But seriously, this only won 3 Oscars? Are you kidding me?)"
9,Made me become a film maker,"The Best Movies of all time. Story, Screenplay and Direction well crafted."
10,the best movie ever,"This is my number one movie. It is the best mafia movie. It is the best movie of AL Pacino. I heard that the director put a real horse head, and the actor did not knew that, so his reaction was real. You can feel the power throw the head of the family ""the godfather himself"".

10,Film making at its finest.,"This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers."
10,Awesome!,"That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the ""Godfather"" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're cultural touchstones.

When writing about The Godfather it's impossible to ignore its subsequent sequel, which could have coasted off of its predecessor, but instead enriches everything that came before. The Godfather Part II delves into the background of Vito's rise to power, establishing the foundations of the family's bribery, theft, corruption and murder. Meanwhile, Michael Corleone is a shell of his former self.

The film spans decades between young Vito (Robert DeNiro) climbing the socio-economic ladder of New York City and Michael seeking a way to legitimize the family in Nevada. As each move is made to push the Corleone name into the neon-lit streets of Las Vegas, Michael is stymied at every turn by Miami boss Hyman Roth. Later on, we learn of an intimate betrayal that seals Michael's spiral into evil and cements Part II as an equal successor to Coppola's original."
1,"1/10, the most overestimated ever made, and one of the worst","The only people who could give to this film a note over 1, are people who have never watched too many films(like my father,he says it's a masterpiece, but he don't like cinema, he just repeats what most people say), as a cinephile, this film has a lot of failures, and obviously not the best film in its genre, and it can't have this rank just because ""it shows how italian family and organized crime is"", that's a silly and empty argument, you people got to have better arguments TO RANK A FILM! more knowledge, watch more movies, study cinema history and cinema production!!! you can't give this film a 10 just because ""it's a classic"" or because ""everyone has heard about this film"", JUST DON'T, the people who liked this or call it a masterpiece, with all the respect, are people who don't like cinema too much or don't know much about it, sorry, but that is a fact.It's a good film, but compared to he thousands of films ever made, it's one of the worst."
10,Without a doubt: the best story ever - the best film ever,"Not often you will be able to find a film that is as good as the novel it's based upon. For sure the reason in this case is that Mario Puzo also wrote the screenplay. Fully recommended to read the book and to watch the film, in either order. Any more comment needless."
10,Best movie ever made in Hollywood,"First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely .

It is the best movie ever made in Hollywood . Probably the best movie on the previous century . It indicates how important can be a family bond . Vito Corleone's quotes - I gonna make him an offer he can't refuse made him more special to me ."
10,Barzini's a pimp,"..Barzini's a pimp. That is my favorite line in this movie...There are many more lines. Lines that everyone should watch. Because this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best mob/crime movies. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, or anything else with Joe Pesci. You will like this movie just as much. The cinematic quality is fantastic. The dialogue and acting are very convincing and makes it feel like you are watching history, not just a movie. And speaking of history, talk about Marlon Brando. Good lord. The guy puts his existence on pause to breathe life into Don Vito Corleone as the Godfather. His roll is phenomenal.

And that's 10 lines, go watch the movie"
8,What else to say?,"Well... believe it or not, this weekend was the first time I actually sat down and watched the Godfather all the way through. Sure, it's great, but I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites of all time. It does have a timeless quality, however, and brilliant nuances, even in the most in-your-face scenes. I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, though I was probably the last one who hadn't seen it."
10,Blurring morality,"This breathtaking masterpiece tells the story of a crime family through it's rich script and dilemmas. The film has you the minute it starts with the profoundly sympathetic character at the start with his monologue about his daughters circumstances. From start to finish it blurs the lines between good and bad, black and white and begs the question of loyalty, family and power. The crime family with so much power and control cannot control their own family and it's affairs, ironic isn't it? Marlon Brando's performance is the epitome of flawless acting and Al Pacino's acting is seamless and sharp. The film does drag in some parts in my opinion but every film has its flaws and cannot be perfect because perfection is subjective. This film took the books version and perfectly puts it onto film, some say and even in my opinion is better than the book itself."
1,Boring,"A cure for Insomnia, a boring movie. Not worthy of being labelled ""great""."
10,OK. A nice one!,"What a masterpiece, hope this all movie series will never be forgotten and every person who respects and deserves honor should have all collection at home. Greatest actors of all times played their parts Perfect! A movie means a lot of emotion. The perspective of life is very decisive in a 'Capo' life like Godfather's because danger strikes at every time when you aspect the most little of all. I'd love to see the movie over and over again, the originality hidden underneath it is barely visible. I hope that every person who wants a lesson for life could watch this masterpiece and see the hardest moments in life are made for toughness, to go in battle with life and win the battle, or at least try to . I wish i could've been in those years when the life was a lot more tougher than it is nowadays. Look at all the people that don't give respect but are pretending to have it but they do not do a thing for having it. Anyway, a masterpiece will heavily remain in our hearts among these special actors."
10,Just Wow,"An American classic, and one of the greatest film's ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The film chronicles a ten year span (1945 to 1955) in the life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family of New York City.

It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. The greatest gangster film ever made. Coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail

""must see"" masterpiece."
10,Best ever,The best movie ever! Watched it over 20 times and it is getting better and better every time! Read a book also.
10,Excellent Movie,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm going to be one of those annoying people and say that the book is better than the movie, but the movie was still great. I've seen this movie multiple times and each time it gets better and better. I appreciate the fact that the movie stuck to the family business more than the book did, because that was one of the weak parts of the book when they talked about that one girls vagina for a couple chapters. Both the movie and the book were great though and I would recommend them to absolutely anybody who's looking for a good mafia movie that has an actual story and isn't just a bunch of random shooting."
10,This will live forever,When you feel. That's it nothing more. When you feel.
10,Far more deserving than FoTR,"In many ways, this is less of a Hollywood film and more a Greek tragedy. The fall of our roguish hero, Michael Corleone, from hotshot son of a crumbling mafia dynasty, wishing to break free from his roots, going to College and then joing the Army.

As he returns, and the safety of his world is broken away, it comes down a simple choice. Dishonour his family (who are massacred along the way) and surrender, or fight back and take over for good.

Coppola's films might not have the same drive of their narrative most films have, but what they make up for is some of the best and most simple cinematography, great characters and great acting, and for an all star-lineup... well."
7,You can watch it .. but don't expect too much if you're from the younger generation,"If you like the genre, go watch it. Better than the irishman."
1,This film is nothing,"This film is very stereotypical and as I am half Italian I feel I have the right to stick up for the crowds of real italians who find this film totally offensive and even boring. This kind of film can lead to racist attitudes in our society as it's portrayal of normal folk is completely over the top (OTT). Marlon Brando received many praises for his performance but there are too many inaccuracies too mention in his accent, never mind his mannerisms.

I watched this film with my friend, his Italian wife and her parents who don't speak English, and get this!!! they fell asleep!!! The greatest movie of all time and they fell asleep!!. I managed to stay awake but it was hard but my friend loved it for some weird reason, but he's an oddball so he doesn't count.

Certainly does not deserve to be numero one, instead may I suggest the princess bride, a classic tale of love and adventure."
10,The best of the best. Perfection at a glance.,"I believe that ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece, an excellent movie which I have seen about 6 times. I have not gotten bored by watching it, thus I wait for a next opportunity to watch it again. The problem is that now I feels like a 90 minutes movie instead of a 171 minute film. But it's still great. I saw the three movies in one day, and let me tell you that the movie changed my life. My mind thought differently and I began to feel stronger, better self confidence. I'm not saying that I started to kill, but I can relate to this film. Probably I'm not the only Godfather fan with this feeling. I can confess that I've not read the book, but before I die I will read it. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's worth it. I wish I were born before the movie came out so I could see it at a movie theater. I am waiting for the DVD version, and I hope it comes out soon. So I guess I will have to buy a DVD player!!! But for now I enjoy it in VHS digitally remastered. The acting is incredible, like if the actors were real, like if the Corleone Family really existed or does exist."
9,About the movie,"This movie is the best movie ever for me ! He deserve the first place ! Story : ""Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" -This short story said everything about this movie, i liked all the personality, specially the hero of the movie. The Director he had know how to play with all the personalities and their roles. So great thank to him because he make a great movie. For the stars, ""Unkonwn"" he's my best actor all time ! 14 October 1994 is a special day, so always remember it ! :D I liked everything about the movie, even the Soundtracks. I think in our day we missed the movies such as The Shawshank Redemption, and the good father .. :("
10,unbelievable,"This movie is unbelievable. Now we are almost in 2005 years.

But i think the best movie in the world maybe in space is GODFATHER-I. Because we cant see in the other films such this type of acting.

In godfather you can join film, smell the places, live their feels,

and you can judge the same behaves like godfather. For movies The most importing is Music. And i think music of godfather is the best soundtrack. So it makes a wonderful connection for the film. The musics are having get excited the audiences. These are enough for being best movie in the world. Viva Godfather!!!!!!!

My all opinion is this. Sorry for not obeying this rule!!

Please note there is a 1,000 word limit on comments. The recommended length is 200 to 500 words. The minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. Comments which are too short or have been padded with junk text will be discarded. You may only post a single comment per title."
9,He made us a movie we couldn't refuse!,"This movie is questionably the best ever made. It's in my top five (at #4). #4 my seem a little high, but Scorsese slid into #1, #2, and #3.

Anyway, this movie was fantastic. Francis Ford Coppala has made the most memorable movie in movie history. That's a croc that Pacino didn't get best supporting actor, or Coppala getting best director. Oh well.

There's not a whole lot else to say, great plot, great acting, great character development, great movie! 10/10"
8,Very good film,It's perfect for my current mood. Reccoment it everyone
9,"Its Not just a film , its some thing you must feel","When you see this film you just would like to still feeling the amazing acting , decorations and whole environment , its really recommended to watch this film"
10,One of the greatest films ever made.,"Well where to begin this film for me is the pinnacle of film. Its beautiful in every way. The music, acting, scenery, is virtually perfect. Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan."
10,"The Godfather (1972), is a Drama movie about a crime family, but unlike other crime movies, this one shows both the good and the bad of the gangsters.","The Godfather (1972) was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who in 1970 directed the successful movie Patton. Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances.

The first scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, and gives the viewer an early insight as to what to expect through the movie. It starts off in a dark room where the face of an old friend of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the old friend was begging Don Vito to help him deliver justice to the two men who had beaten his daughter. Don Vito Corleone was offended that his old friend had gone to the police for help before coming to him. However, when his friend explains he was scared to because he desired to live an honest life in America, but when a judge gives the two men suspended sentences, he knows the only way to punish these men was to go to Don Vito Corleone. It is apparent from the beginning that Don Vito Corleone is a dangerous man, but he is also shown as a compassionate man, when he agrees to help his old friend, but tells him he may one day ask for a favor in return for his help. The favor he asks from his old friend is one that will shock the audience!

That same day, the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter was going on, and after the meeting with his friend, he went out for a family picture. Another soft side of the godfather is revealed as he puts off the family picture until his son Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Michael shows up dressed in a military uniform and is the only member of the family not involved in the family crime business. An exciting sequence of events changes that, however.

This movie from start to finish is full of excitement and surprises, and it starts when Don Vito Corleone once again shows he has morals and refuses to involve his family in the drug trade. Not all the New York families process these morals, and the bloody feud ensues, which leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat anticipating what is going to happen next. This movie is not for the faint hearted, but it shows both sides of a crime family, from the love they share for their children, wife's, and other family members, to the murderous rages, which can be triggered at any moment. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino put in stunning performances' which is supported from the excellent supporting actors.'

With 32 awards, which include three Academy Awards, and 19 nominations for awards, it would not be an exaggeration to say The God Father is one of the best movies of all time. For anyone who has not yet watched this movie, it will provide 175 minutes of ultimate excitement, and leave him or her eager to watch The Godfather II."
6,This Movie Always A Must See:,Definitely Don't Miss A Opportunity To Rent This Film:
4,Really good if you're trying to sleep.,"This is honestly the most one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. No way in hell does it get so many good ratings based on anything more than sheer nostalgia.

I don't know how good it was 50 years ago, but it does not stand the test of time."
10,The best film I have ever seen.,Seen this film over 100 times. Everything about it is great. Saw it when it was first released and it's never faded or got weaker.
9,Go ahead and read the reviews for 1 stars,"I think many of the good reviews speak for themselves about why this movie is so beloved, but if you have some spare time, go ahead and read the reviews for the 1 Star ratings. Mostly you'll hear a bunch of rambling about how everyone who likes this movie has really low IQ, as they struggle to put coherent sentences together. Irony at its finest ladies and gentlemen."
10,Fantastic,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the crime genre. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it combines brilliant storytelling, unforgettable performances, and a hauntingly beautiful score. The film masterfully explores themes of power, loyalty, and family, offering a compelling look into the intricate dynamics of a powerful crime dynasty. Its nuanced characters, rich atmosphere, and impeccable attention to detail create an immersive experience that captivates from start to finish. A timeless classic, The Godfather remains an essential piece of film history. A timeless classic, The Godfather remains an essential piece of film history."
10,Al Pacino rising,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
8,It's still as fresh and still as enthralling even now.,"Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.

Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.

The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify: a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead  there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.

Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.

But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.

Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression. It is the getting under the skin of a lifestyle that we watch, the emotional and natural progression of a family, only difference being that this family are a New York based Mafia organisation but with an equally fascinating tale to tell."
6,good,Very good movie and very very fun and very very very old is gudfadern and basiclly a very good family movie to watch on a friday night with some popcorn and with big family!!!!!!!
4,Godfather: LET DOWN,"I am a 14 year old film buff and have just set up my account on IMDb if i had set this up earlier i would have commented on this film before now. I watched the Godfather when i got it as a Christmas present 3 years ago, when i watched it i immediately thought wow what a let down!! everyone who i spoke to had said it was one of the best films they had ever seen. But i disagree, there is no denying that the acting and direction in the Godfather is sublime but it is the fact that it is so monotonous, many people will say that it is because i am 14 but i have seen many films including other Coppela films such as The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, which is my favourite film so i definitely am not saying that Coppela cannot direct but what i am saying is that he could have done so much better with the script, the talent and the locations. So overall I am saying this: The Godfather is not a Bad film just very poor and it is definitely not all it is cracked up to be. Thankyou for reading my review."
9,The excellent and dynamic movie ever made,"A number of factors are just designed to end up being ideal, sleek as well as nicely, godly. This Godfather, through Francis Kia Coppola as well as Mario Puzo is actually. Just how all facets involving filmmaking as well as storytelling enhances the other within this unforgettable motion picture leads to that you ask yourself ( really) if such a task might be repeated, actually.

I possess the maximum value for your software prior to everything related to videos, therefore Let me look at Godfather's script initial.

Used from Mario Puzo's book in the very same identify This Godfather is dependant on the man's relationship along with his family members as well as his / her responsibilties to that, that could result in your pet in order to forego her own dreams as well as aspirations. That this build is actually put on show through one of the most highly effective mafia individuals with 1940s Nyc causes it to be all the more fascinating.

The easy piece getting that the head in the Corleone criminal offenses family members is actually ageing as well as other criminal offenses companies would like your pet out of the way looks quite simple. Key in Wear Vito Corleone's littlest kid Erina also called 'the not liable university boy' - seeing that his / her parent buddy as well as apparent heir Sonny Corleone loves to telephone your pet - in addition to a young lady. They sums upward his / her living as well as that he / she desires from using it with foreseeable future available as one line - ""This is actually our kids Kay, not necessarily everyone. inch Rather plainly the kid wishes practically nothing about his / her criminal offenses family members or even it is electric power. Yet this family members expands with criminal offenses as well as undoubtedly gets the target as well. Right after Vito refuses to manage the narcotics kingpin named Virgil Sollozo, he / she cause the string involving situations of which varies his / her family members as well as enterprise design once and for all. Obviously any good male that has encountered that living may offer ceases to see what exactly is forthcoming as well as states his / her amaze later on.

A new tragic as well as intellect numbing account involving what sort of highly effective criminal offenses family members comes to terminology together with that that nourishes with as well as the way the very same organizations practically eliminate the household seemed to be, is actually and may keep on being unforgettable."
10,The best movie in history,"In my opinion, it is the best film in the history of cinema."
9,Simply Excellent----9/10,"It is no wonder The Godafather is often regarded as the best film ever. It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent. In my opinion Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever, but this pulls in an ultra close second. 9/10"
10,The reason why we should go to cinema and watch films,"""The Godfather"" is flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. This is the best role Al Pacino ever played, and he didn't win best actor. The only negative thing i could say i have against the film. Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940's, in this well- respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates."
8,A dark world sprinkled with moments of beauty.,"It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece."
10,Best movie ever when you....,"I love this movie. You know, when there is sometime, nothing is going your way, life is miserable, sad and you cant sleep... just like what i used to.

By a chance, my friend introduced me this movie. Oh god, my best friend ever he is! The best movie ever this is! As I watch, no soon later i fall asleep! For days and months i didn't sleep well... Do you know how much this movie meant to me? Even sleeping pills didn't work for me.

After that, I watch this movie whenever i got frustrated and feeling sad. I always seeking for friends who got sleeping problem and solve their problem by introduce this, The Best Movie Ever When You Cant Sleep! It will work for you too!"
7,What can I say?,The Godfather don't need to somebody's advice to watch. this is a nice movie with fantastic cast. actors are truly amazing. but the movie doesn't have an attractive beginning. or sometimes it could be boring for somebody.
4,Imbeciles,"A friend of mine and I were arguing as to the greatest film of all time and he sent me to this site to see what the idiots (all 250k of em) here had decided was the best pic. I of course (like anyone with sense and taste or knowledge of film) was extolling the unlimited virtues and impact of the REAL best picture of all time, Citizen Kane. He meanwhile was arguing for the Godfather and I just figured it was his immaturity or possibly his ignorance and then when told me to go to imfd id10t or whatever this site is I was ASTONISHED to find that there were a quarter of million other people who agreed. Habadashery!!! There could not have even been a ""godfather"" without Citizen Kane, ALL of modern film owes a debt of gratitude to that film and anyone who knows anything about film making knows this. Please refer to AFI or just ask any freshman student of film. Blasphemy! and everyone knows that Peewees big adventure is the foundation for the future of film./ HAHA."
10,Sets the bar in terms of quality - for any film ever made.,"The Godfather is not a film for everyone, you need patience, understanding, and appreciation for pure cinema.

And pure cinema is exactly what you get. This masterpiece of acting, directing, storytelling, is so deep and meaningful, you may need several viewings to truly get the beautiful cinematic picture that this film paints, I did.

If you have doubts about the films greatness, give it a chance, watch the whole thing at once, immerse yourself in the experience.

The way all the characters interact and flow is so realistic, Al Pacino did an outstanding job in particular and is widely regarded as the greatest actor of all time, and for good reason.

This film will undoubtedly stand the test of time, and I would be very surprised if something came along to out-do this 1972 classic.

I'm not sure if Francis Ford Coppola knew what a piece of magical film making he was gifting to the world."
9,Masterpiece,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather."
10,Masterpiece,Amazing character development. Sound was carefully woven into every scene. One word: masterpiece.
10,The best Gangster film EVER,I know everybody says the same thing but this truly is a masterpiece. There are so many truths in the film to real gansterism. like the raspy voice of don Vito is like that of Frank Costello's voice. The wedding at the start of the film is like the Bill Bonanno wedding and even the plot to kill the heads of the five main families at the end of thefilm is taken from Joe Bonanno so i think Mario Puzo knew a lot more about the mob than maybe we all first thought. But still an outstanding piece of film and the book is superb as well.
10,The innocent son of the don of a mafia gets hooked in the family business when the father gets crittically wounded.,"The Godfather is the best movie ever, also the best adaptation from a book, Francis Ford Coppola did a great job on knowing what to put in, and what to put out. I would like to point out that characters in the book have the last names of some of the people part of the movie, Anthony Coppola is one character obviously the relation is with Francis Ford Coppola, I forgot the first name but there was a Mancini as one character, the relation is the guy who did the them song's name is Henry Mancini. Also the producer did a great job of picking all Italian people, I heard somewhere that they almost picked Robert Redford for the job as Michael Corleone, somewhere on television, once I heard this I new it was one of the worst picks ever, I don't know how the producer could've picked that but the rest of the cast is tremendous. This is also great because nobody thought of the mafia underworld idea until Mario Puzo came out with the book, nobody knew how to make the book into the movie, and some people didn't think of making the book into the movie. A lot of people say the second one is better than the first, I would say no on that, because there's nothing better than the oringinal, the second one was excellent, but not as good as the first because it was as entertaining as the first, the things that almost bored me was the family situations, family crisis, not a lot of action, and shooting. In the first one the kills were more out of no where, and surprising me, like when the man went to take a leak, and on the way back the guy killed the guy, a brilliant set up. This movie is tremendous and wonder why would anybody give it a one, because I saw on the voting charts there was a 1.6, for the ones, maybe they don't recognize the excellence, and art of this movie, but I would like to say the movie is brilliant, I gave it a 10, and I hope you do to."
10,Movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.,"If there was one valuable and simple lesson that I learned from watching ""The Godfather"". I learned that movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.

This film was based on the unforgettable novel by the late Mario Puzo and it was wonderfully adapted into the story that was written by Puzo himself and Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film.

The film is like the book itself, it's extraordinary and respects the subject that it focuses on. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are terrific in their roles and there are several scenes that left me both surprised and in awe. Some of the violent moments aren't only graphic, but very grizzly as well. The baptism massacre, one scene where Sonny (James Caan) is setup and is shot up like a piece of Swiss cheese, and another scene where Vito (Brando) is shot in public and Fredo (the late John Cazale) can't even shoot the two hoodlums best illustrate how ugly living in the Mob can get.

Besides the other film that was directed by Coppola (""Apocolyspe Now"") that I deeply cherish, this film has a great supporting cast and I've mentioned a few of those key actors.

Even Coppola's daughter, Sofia, who would later star in the third ""Godfather"" film and have also directed her first film (""The Virgin Suicides""), is unbilled as the baby that is baptised in the church before the unpleasant massacre starts."
10,Without a doubt ...,"This is the best movie of my lifetime. And of course, Marlon Brando being the best of the best."
10,the best in my opinion,"the godfather does what it does at it's finest, memorable moments,characters and situations. all the actors made the best they could and more, interesting plot and mix it with some drama-crime you have a master piece, glorious and epic in mafia movies and one of the best if not the best movie ever made, Francis ford made the best crime drama movie till date and alpacino made the godfather even better with his acting and role, the moment that stick's out is ¨""ill make him an offer he can't refuse"" it is just a small line but epic if you understand it and know what could happen because he is the godfather and he is the mafia leader and he does a fine job at doing so. 10/10 godfather approves"
6,"Long and tedious, Might need a rewatch",I was hoping when I wasted this but i don'tRemember it getting that good. Maybe I will rewatch and if so I will review it again
1,bloody disappointing,"As a 19 yr old watching this film recently for my first time I simply cant see this film continuing to be considered the best film of all time.

Yes the acting is good and the script is very smooth but there are large chunks of this film that can only be described as horribly boring

Nearly everyone I know in my generation agrees this is highly overrated so I think its only a matter of time before another film lifts it off top spot (hopefully Shawshank redemption - although return of the king is more likely)

4/10"
10,Review,"One of the best if not even the best movie about mafia (Along with part I and part II).

A Oscar awarded movie,it might be old (1972) but I still recommend it to everybody.

The actors Marlon Brando and Al Pacino will be for ever remembered for their part in this movie as Don Vito Corleone (Godfather) and Michael Corleone (his son that eventually became Godfather)

Respect for the Writer , Director of the movie , Actors and everybody else that was on the set , they did a amazing job that has marked everybody that saw the Godfather series. Well done !

This movie has to be seen at least once in a lifetime !

Do not miss this movie !"
9,A Must See,"I recently watched the film The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and based on the book by Mario Puzo. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The film takes place in New York in a post-World War II setting. The films is a stirring drama filled with poignant moments throughout.

This film follows the lives of the Corleone family who is one of the five organized crime families that control the city and state of New York. This film takes you through the good and the bad sides of an organized crime family. The film has moments where you forget that this family is a mob family who commits murders like others commit minor traffic violations. Some of the more memorable scenes in the movie include the very opening scene in the movie when The Godfather (Vito Corleone) is sitting in a dark home office setting where he is receiving any guest to his daughter's wedding who has a request for him. Apparently there is an old Sicilian tradition that says that a father cannot refuse any reasonable request on the day that his daughter is to be married. Why haven't I been invited to more Italian weddings? I'm getting really tired of dealing with my wife telling me to clean up after I make a mess. Where is a Godfather when you need him? Another scene that caught my attention is a meeting that the Corleone family has with a man by the name of Sollozzo. This man has an offer for the family to begin moving the family into the drug business. The scene gets me because you would think that a mob boss would be up for whatever if it means making money, but not Don Corleone. He almost seems like a respectable business man who would not do anything that has to do with drugs. This scene is pivotal as it sets in motion the events of the rest of the movie. Upon the refusal of Sollozzo's offer he sets up an assassination attempt on The Godfather's life which is carried out but fails as the Don lives through the attempt. After the assassination attempt there has to be a reaction from the family and to everyone's surprise this gets Michael Corleone involved in the family business that he swore he would never be involved with. Michael's involvement leads him to carry out the assassination of Sollozzo and the chief of police. This act of vengeance leads Michael to a yearlong hide out in Italy while the rest of the family and their associates go to the mats for a bitter mob war. There are many other moments in the film to be seen and the film moves in a very unpredictable way that has to be seen rather than told in a film review.

One of the best aspects of the movie is the background music that plays at certain times in the movie. It is nothing that is going to blow you away, and it isn't anything that you are going to recognize unless you are familiar with some sort of dark orchestra that I have never heard of before. The movie plays music at the right times and it does an amazing job of building the suspense of the scenes where it has been included. One example is toward the end of the movie when Michael's nephew is being baptized and the movie is going through a series of parallel cuts and the music does an amazing job of building the suspense during this scene. This is a classic example of someone doing their homework and realizing that sometimes music can be done to the point of overkill. No worries of that here just a great job by the sound crew.

Another fine job in the movie is the acting. The cast of this movie was brilliantly put together and each character is played absolutely brilliantly. From The Godfather down to the Mafioso's who work for him each character is played with precision and by men and women who seem to fit the roles that they were cast for as if they were leading their normal lives. The casting crew gets a round of applause from me for the job that they did with this film.

The Godfather is a film that will stand the test of time when it comes to motion pictures. With a brilliant plot and a moving storyline this movie is one of the best that I have ever seen. The characters portray a group that seem for all intents and purposes to be a real family who love and care about one another while going about their daily lives of committing murders and breaking the law. This film will be one of the greats of all time and it will leave viewers with a sense of wanting to be a part of a crime syndicate like the Corleone family. I encourage anyone who enjoys movies that tell a story in a moving and powerful way to go and see The Godfather. I promise that you will not be disappointed and you will be begging for more by the time that the movie is over. My overall film rating for this movie is a resounding 5 out of 5 trigger fingers because I think that they work better for this movie than stars or thumbs. Go see the movie and enjoy!"
10,The Godfather - absolute classic!,"This movie is basically the gangster film that everyone else tries to copy, but they just can't touch it. It's about the Corleones, this big-time mafia family trying to hold onto power in a world that's kinda out to get them. You've got Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, who is just this total boss. Seriously, the guy barely raises his voice, and everyone listens!

Then there's Michael, played by young Al Pacino, who starts off just trying to be the ""normal"" one in the family but gets pulled into the whole mafia life. His journey is wild - by the end, he's basically the last person you'd want to mess with.

The whole vibe of the movie is dark and intense. Every scene feels like it has a deeper meaning. And the music? Iconic! Even if you haven't seen it, you probably know the main theme. It's not just about action; it's got heart, drama, family stuff, and a whole lot of ""what-would-you-do"" moments. If you haven't seen it, just do yourself a favor and watch it."
10,Powerful and incredible...,"I cannot believe how long it took me to finally see this movie, especially since I love ""mobster"" movies. But, no matter how many times they showed it on cable networks, I refused to watch it when it would be edited and cut to pieces. Finally, I rented The Godfather and it was even better than all that I had heard from everyone.

Although I think Al Pacino has the potential to be a great actor, I haven't cared much for seeing him in movies because he always seems the exact same. However, in The Godfather he was different (yet still the same). I saw much more versatility in him...from young and full of ideals to finally finding his place in the family business. He wasn't his usual over the top ""HOOHA"" thug like in so many movies. Quite refreshing. Marlon Brando has always been one of my favorites and his performance was fantastic...fitting right into his role like a hand to a glove.

The Godfather has become one of my all time favorite movies and the more I watch it, the more I discover what I hadn't noticed in prior viewings. To me, this is a timeless piece that only gets better with each time you watch the movie. It definitely has lost none of its appeal in the years gone by.

Without a doubt, The Godfather earns a 10 out 10 stars; and of course, is a DEFINITE must see. But please, don't watch this in an edited version...it simply is not the same."
9,Great Movie,Beautiful movie by all standards. Old but great and all need to watch.
10,The best movie of criminal organizations,"The effect it has on my ""Godfather"" is amazing, powerful sensation of tasting authentic cinema from the first to the last moment ...

Many talk about the wedding sequence is long and somewhat boring, and seems to me a presentation of characters extraordinary:

From Don Vito to Johnny are defined and characterized spectacularly, nothing squeaks, everything has a meaning, not a single actor out of tune, not a single frame is misguided ... in Ultimately, we are witnessing a starter that leaves you suspended in its history, its setting and in all conflicts presented in an absolutely impeccable.

The best movie of criminal organizations"
10,The Mafia Masterpiece you cannot refuse!,"The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made. A complex and detailed gangster epic from 1946 to the late fifties on the Corleone family 'business'.

It stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the most powerful lord of the Cosa Nostra, approaching the twilight of his life, the Don and his family come under attack from a Turkish gangster called Sollozzo who is angry at the Don's refusal to give him legal protection for his new drugs business, and so a war begins between the five families of New York city over a period of five years. Slowly the Mafia Don's reluctant son Michael (who is a decorated soldier) takes over and later self-discovers that he was always destined to be a man like his father.

This is really what the heart of the story is all about, a man who wanted to be honest and good in life but because of terrible circumstances takes over an Empire and becomes a figure he always denied.

The cast and supporting players are all excellent but the standout is Al Pacino.

Ten Out Of Ten."
6,Very Good film,This film is very Good everbody see this film the Good father
1,sucks,"I dont see the big deal about this movie. I think it sucks. Everyone always talks about how good it is and that it's a classic

and it makes me just want to tape their mouths shut. This movie does not deserve such a high rating."
8,The Sicilian Way doesn't work in the Anglo-Saxon world,"If you lived in Sicily over the last 3,000 years you'd be pretty used to death and devastation by now. Sicily is bang smack in the middle of three prominent pre-Christian empires: the Greek post-Alexander Hellenistic empire, the Roman Empire and the Carthagian-Lavantine Empire. All three of them fought tooth and nail for 3 centuries to control Sicily. And I haven't mentioned yet the tyrants who used to rule Sicilian cities such as Syracuse, for whom the Greek engineer Archimedes worked. Then came the bully-boy, Normans, the Hapsburg Empire, Napoleon, Mussolini, the Nazis...oh where does it end?

In other words, dying, or threatening others with death, is just something else to do on a Sunday afternoon in Sicily. The Sicilians also learnt how to barter with their masters of the day, and how to subjugate their own.

Transfer all of this to a quiet neighbourhood of New York City, and it's like trusting King Kong into the city to clean the windows of the Empire State Building.

The Godfather, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, shows how capable the Sicilian Mafia are at subduing the authorities to run their own profiteering rackets. But what's interesting is how after the Godfather was shown, how the authorities decided they had had enough of being manipulated by Sicilians. It wasn't long before they put every effort into suppressing these usurpers. The US authorities regained the role the Greeks, Romans and Carthagians had once held.

Sicilian management is impressive, but not as impressive as good old Dutch-Anglo-Saxon mastery of all things profitable.

A point of interest, the decapitation of the horse-head scene in this movie has its foundation in Roman Chariot racing on The Field Of Mars. One of the winning horses would be sacrificed, it's blood mixed with the bodies of the unborn children and its head nailed to the door of the Forum."
10,The Godfather reaches new levels in film-making and is a must see for any film enthusiast,"The Godfather is a masterpiece in terms of cinematic achievements which boasts near flawless acting most notably from Brando at his scene stealing best. The film is brought to life with a strong script and a haunting score from Nino Rota. If you care for films, make sure you get out and see this. It is brutal without being unnecessarily graphic and moving without being unnecessarily sentimental. We build up a fantastic relationship with the characters and we care an awful lot when something important happens to them. It has been said that this film ""gets better as time goes on"" but I am not so sure of this as the general taste of the audience is not for this kind of film. It is a refreshing break from the mind-numbing trauma that is Transformers and other heartless Hollywood Blockbusters. One of the greatest films of the 70s? No. One of greatest films of all time!"
10,Worthy of its Oscar,"This was a classic that won best picture, and it was a long movie. This length was actually a necessary evil, however, as a lot went on during the course of the film and it's multiple reversals as well as requiring the time to not only introduce a myriad of characters, but fill them out to be real people.

It took about 45 minutes for this film to pick up some steam and start going due to getting everyone introduced, but being a drama based on a book, the direction changed a few times during the course of the film. This slow start is at once alleviated on a second viewing, however, since knowing the characters the second time around, you ""get"" everything a lot more clearly and the momentum is obvious from the get-go.

Vito Corleone is the Godfather, not only of the Corleone clan, but of many of the people he has come into contact with over the years, particularly in the Italian community. He creates many give and take relationship with a lot of people, and follows through on them. The first part of the film focuses on Vito and his reign as Don, then the focus shifts to between his sons, Michael and Sonny when the Don runs into a bit of trouble. Once Michael is placed center stage as the main character, and even on a first viewing, this was the point where the film really got into its groove and took off.

It got a little slow while Michael ran off to Sicily, and that all seemed like a big side story we could deal without, but it allowed Sonny's reign to come and go, which was not necessarily a pleasant thing.

The characters, as I said, were numerous and well-rounded, and it's just astounding how well they were drawn throughout the film. Granted, the length of the film allowed this luxury and a shorter film likely would have dropped all those little moments which make these fictional characters seem real, but it worked so well.

It ended up being a solid film and certainly worthy of its Oscar. However, this movie should only be approached if you're in the mood to be thought-provoked."
9,Best Mafia Movie and a contender for best of all time,"It goes without saying that this is a classic for the ages. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Mafia Godfather Don Corleone is one of the if not the best performance I have seen from an actor in a movie. When you add the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and so many other amazing supporting actors & Movie Magic truly happens. I felt like I was in New York at the height of the Sicilian/Italian Mafias reign the first time I saw The Godfather and am still captivated and entertained every time I watch this Movie. Mario Puzo is a wonderful writer and Francis Ford Coppola really knows what he is doing behind the camera this is the perfect storm a great movie making."
10,Top 1,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael , Santino and Tom Hagen , his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates. he Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy."
9,Beautiful!,"The Godfather is, in a nutshell, a terrific movie.

The cast is brilliant, from Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) to Diane Keaton (Kay Adams); each one of them suits their role perfectly.

Marlon Brando is without a doubt, one of the best actors to ever set foot on this earth. His astonishing portrayal of Vito makes me sad that he's not going to appear in the sequels.

Al Pacino also plays a beautiful role, one of Vito's sons who later takes on the family business. Notice how he transforms himself from this calm war-hero to a hard-ass Don. Not a lot of people can do that.

I love how the movie - most of it at least - takes place in New York while most of the characters are Italian. But that only spices the movie up. The story is unique and smartly written, and it suits me since I like the time that it took place in.

So if you're a fan of the post-WWII age, then I strongly urge you to get this movie. Hell, even if you're not, it would be a shame if you don't watch it."
8,Wwwwww,"One of the greatest films of all time. ""ENGLISH MOTHERTRUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT!"" Is my favorite line of the movie. I love God fiction because, James Chan, Al paxton , Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, and Tim Brando's acting performances in this movie is amazing. This is the greatest Music video of all time. It had me singing ""DE... SPA...CITO"" The whole time. Although 3 hours 42 minutes is long, I still it better that The original. This is my favorite Jerry Seinfield produced film, and I almost want to recreat it. Very underrated, I think it should be Iconic, but unfortunately, It's an indie film i think."
6,Why so long ?,"Same story could be filmed much shorter.. Unnrcessarly long. In 3 hours very few things happen actually. Despite very long duration, there are still many disconnections among timelines."
1,Terrible... Just terrible!,"Terrible... Just terrible. Nauseatingly dull and exceedingly over-hyped. Honestly I could never even think to sit through any of Diane Keaton's acting in my life it is so horrid. Possibly the worst acting that I have ever even witnessed! (Let me tell you I mean that about every single person that is in this film).

I wouldn't even consider writing any more review for such a scathing, vile film of nothingness. Evil movie, don't open this. Do not watch this. Do not speak its words. If I could take back any of the time that I spent watching this movie then I would, because I feel as if a piece of my hollow soul has been torn from my within, and that it is not something that I could ever have back."
10,One of the greatest films ever made.,"""The Godfather"" stands as a towering masterpiece, depicting the tumultuous journey of the Corleone family with unparalleled depth and complexity. Anchored by a stellar cast and masterful storytelling, it emerges as a pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone transcends mere acting, delivering a performance that is nothing short of legendary. His nuanced expressions and delivery elevate the film to unparalleled heights. Al Pacino's depiction of Michael Corleone is equally compelling, characterized by a chilling intensity that captivates audiences throughout. The supporting cast, including Robert Duvall, contributes to the film's rich tapestry of characters, each adding depth and dimension to the narrative. At the heart of ""The Godfather"" lies its meticulously crafted screenplay, a testament to the collaborative genius of Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Every scene is imbued with layers of meaning, culminating in moments of breathtaking brilliance such as the iconic restaurant scene. The interplay of dialogue and narrative serves to immerse viewers in the intricate web of power, loyalty, and betrayal that defines the Corleone legacy. Coppola's direction is masterful, weaving together a visual tapestry that is both striking and evocative. From the haunting darkness that shrouds the family's impending doom to the subtle nuances of their clandestine operations, every frame is infused with meaning and significance. Beyond its technical prowess, ""The Godfather"" resonates on a deeply emotional level, tracing the tragic arc of a family torn apart by ambition and betrayal. Each scene is a testament to the film's thematic depth, exploring the complexities of human nature with profound insight and sensitivity. The haunting baptism sequence stands as a poignant example of the film's emotional resonance, blending moments of solemn reflection with bursts of visceral intensity. As the narrative unfolds, compelling subplots intertwine to create a rich tapestry of intrigue and suspense, culminating in a conclusion that is both satisfying and profound. Nino Rota's evocative score serves as the perfect complement to the film's visual and narrative elements, enriching the viewing experience with its haunting melodies and atmospheric compositions. Together, the score, cinematography, and performances coalesce to form a cinematic symphony of unparalleled beauty and depth. In the annals of film history, ""The Godfather"" stands as a timeless classic, its legacy enduring as a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring allure of the human experience. With its flawless execution and profound emotional resonance, it earns its place among the greatest films ever made, a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences to this day."
10,Perfect !,"Francis Ford Coppola's version of the Mario Puzo best seller is simply perfect. It is without a doubt the best American Film of all time. If you have never seen The Godfather, and you appreciate great movies, then go out and purchase it. This movie should not even be available for rent because it should be in everyone's movie library.

This is a movie with the most ultimate character development. Each scene makes the next one better. The restaurant scene was one of the most tense scenes in cinema history. This isn't just a gangster film; it's a film about cause and effect, what would, could and should be. It's action scenes are a bit dated now, but the directing was masterful here. In my opinion, it's better than the sequel."
10,"The Magnitude Of ""The Godfather"" Achieves In Assisting One's Love Of Film To Grow Beyond All Measure","The majority of critics will cite the definitive ""greatest film of all-time"" as Citizen Kane, but other films are regularly mentioned in conjunction, one of those being The Godfather. Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called ""gangster flicks"", most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.

Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses ""gangsterism"" as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to ""join the family"" because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.

Arguably, the theme of ""violence breeding violence"" is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the ""matter-of-fact"" nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.

Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.

The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the ""false"" commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture. Composed by Nino Rota, the score enhances the emotive style that the film follows throughout the duration.

I have been watching The Godfather for many years now and it remains one of my unquestionably favourite films. Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective. All this is much more than a fleeting glimpse of cinematic heaven, considering the viewer becomes just like one of the characters, a controlled puppet for a game, which -in the case of the film- does not manipulate, but engages."
10,"A truly moving, powerfull, unforgetable film. I priase it with all my heart.","The film begins slowly and dramatically as a man begs the Godfather to pay ""justice"" to the men who have beaten his daughter. A Godfather cannot refuse a request on the day of his daghter's wedding.

This film is a film of such purity and nourishment, an absolute classic which I cannot even begin to describe. The music is breathtakingly aweing, as is the acting. Every line and every action has it's purpous that eventialy all comes together, at the end, especialy the last scene, just makes you want to stand up scream for joy and sorrow and pity all at once.

If you see this film you will never forget it. I have bought it and still can't see it enough. 100%. A+. Five Stars."
10,Spoilers!!!,"This is the best movie i ever seen.

This movie contains great acting and a great plot You must watch it.

If you watch it already watch it again.

I always have the highest regard for the script before anything associated with films , therefore I'd like to talk about Godfather's screenplay first .

The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story.

Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia.

But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best- seller to the big screen.

He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.

There's also something special about how the film interacts with the viewer, and it's hard to exactly explain what it is; it's an unusual tone. I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes: the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music.

I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.

Do not miss this movie."
6,Good but not much impactful,"I watched this movie two times. First time I watched without subtitles, so didn't understand much but recently I have started to read the real Godfather novel (which is pretty much engaging) and also watched the movie last night (with subtitles this time). There is not much twist and turn in the movie, so this movie is straight and simple and also slow paced. But the cinematography and scenes you see in this movie, is top notch. You can also see the the Italian culture in it's true nature. You can also understand how the mafia families actually work. But this is not a movie which can leave a longer impact in your mind. You will forget the movie in few days."
1,hogwash,"what a load of hogwash.absolute tripe typical American rubbish.overrated.bad acting you name it was there.give me will hay any day.why people watch this trash ,i don't know.Marlon Brando,whats he talking about,he justs mumbles.give me a British actor anyday.let me sum up and say this is the worst film,i have ever seen.i hope to god i never see it again.i have been watching movies for thirty years and this is just the worst movie i have seen.it typifies what is wrong with the movie industry,when they can waste money on overblown claptrap such as this.if this is the best Hollywood can offer,god help us.lets just hope it was just a blipand Hollywood can again start making decent movies."
9,One of the greatest movie of all time.,"Hello movie freaks, this is my first ever movie review on IMDb. As I am novice in writing, excuse me for my unintelligent writing. As a first review post I wanted to choose an important and popular movie, so I choose THE GODFATHER.This is only a film where audience can attach emotionally to a DON's life.

Film starts with a sequence where people came to greet and meet Don Vito Carleone and request him to fulfill their desires. In between the scenes we got to know that all the visitors came to attend the wedding of Don's daughter.It would have been very important occasion in any father's life but even at this occasion also Don shows his generosity and kindness who came to his asylum.

This film shows how man is hunger for power and how a man turned violent to protect his family.

THE GODFATHER is best of all his genres not only for its story but also for performances,editing,cinematography and above all for its direction. I don't think that other then the Francis Ford Coppola could have done this."
10,"A Masterpiece, One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made","The Godfather had many in awe during its prime, and it still does today. One of the greatest organized crime films ever created, let alone one of the greatest movies ever created, it shows that anything goes as a mobster in the Itlian mafia. Al Pacino became world famous for his role as Micheal Corleon, son of Don Vito Corleon (Marlon Brando), as he prepares to take the family business from his father. As an Italian myself, I can greatly appreciate what this film is trying to do... show what life is really like as a mobster, and what they practically do. Forget the mobster movie flops, or the Sopranos, this movie shows it all. And to follow it up with an even greater sequel is incredible. It's a masterpiece, a must-see by far."
10,Watch it,If you haven't watched the movie go watch it... seriously it has been out for 40 years dafuq have taken you so long. It's good. Pretty good. 10/10. Good ligthning. Great characters. Great original soundtrack. Great story. Great domestic violence. No this hasn't been a review yet. here it comes. The movie start out very promising and what makes it so great is that it continues having that great promise in mind and deliver it with such great impact. Like it's kinda like 5th impact in Neon Genesis Evangelion there never was a 4th but it jumps over the 4th and gets to the 5th right away like a great movie should. 10/10 avocado.
10,simply the best,"There's no denying...the godfather is the best movie ever. To get the maximum 'godfather effect', simply watch I, II and III on a potentially boring sunday afternoon/evening and you will be stunned, amazed and above all very confused, because this whole movie is a total mindtrip. Believe me, your life will never be the same again and if not so, at least you won't sleep that night because this masterpiece will hit you...

VERY HARD."
10,A Thrilling and Suspenseful Crime Drama,"The Godfather is a 1972 crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola that tells the story of the Corleone crime family, a powerful and influential mafia clan in New York City. The film follows the patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), as he navigates the complex and dangerous world of organized crime, and it explores themes of family, loyalty, and the human condition.

One of the standout features of The Godfather is its portrayal of the complex and multi-layered relationships within the Corleone family. The film is a nuanced exploration of the dynamics of family and the ways in which people connect and disconnect with one another, and it is a thought-provoking and emotional portrayal of the human experience.

The acting in The Godfather is superb, with standout performances from Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Robert De Niro as his son, Michael. Brando's portrayal of Vito is iconic and unforgettable, and De Niro's performance is both powerful and nuanced. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film. The Godfather is a classic and iconic film that is not to be missed. It is a powerful exploration of family and the human condition, and it is also a thrilling and suspenseful crime drama."
9,Masterpiece,Coppola's best work. Marvelous actors and great atmosphere.
10,One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made!,"This is simply one of the best movies ever! Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors ever lived and the movie has a great bonus!-Al Pacino!

Robert Duvall and James Caan give their best and those actors make this movie to a masterpiece. The plot is very interesting and Francis Coppola did a great job. There are many masterpieces like Citizen Kane, A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Forget American Beauty. The best films are already done, there won`t be a better movie.

(aristideswellis@access.ch)"
10,the best movie ever made,"In my opinion ""The Godfather"" is the best movie ever made. It is far and away the best conceptualized film from a novel that has been made, even when compared to ""Gone with the Wind""."
7,An Over-rated insignificance that shouldn't be dubbed as 'one of the best',"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. Judging from this opening statement I know that these film lovers will aggressively spout out and say that I am 100 percent from about the Godfather... BELIEVE ME when I say that it shouldn't be in the same breath as one of the greatest.

Don't get me wrong however, there are a few good qualities which in some way does kind of show some good hallmarks for a good film. The tempo right from the start of the film isn't too bad as it does set a nice tone to the film and kind of signifies what sought of film this will be. In some parts the acting of Marlon Brando as the 'Don' and Al Pacino as Michael do put up good performances which again add's to that verisimilitude to not only the story but to the other characters that are within this film. Although these small film aspects can add to your experience of watching the Godfather, non of this excruciates from the fact that these good factors do have harsh limitations which evidently create more problems throughout the duration of the film.

Even though I did say from the start that the tempo and the duration of the scenes and music is perfect in introducing the characters and some of the story aspects, this is all it does unfortunately. As it gets near enough to the middle point of the film, the whole story and tempo falls flat on it's face and in most parts of when they are talking to some other gang leaders does emphasise this point that sometimes in the film, some of the story elements don't really add up to which personal for me creates a lot of boredom. Another sought of example of this is perfectly clear when the character of Michael is in Italy to lay low from the killings that he committed... I find that the Italia sequence is a complete waste of time and primarily add's to this excuse of being nearly a 3 hour film which really it shouldn't be. This sequence just kills the flow and intensity of what will eventually happen; it postpones the inevitable in some fashion. Although again I did say that the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is exceptionally fine, the majority of their performances not only add's to this lack of entertainment, but in a sense just makes me want to never watch this film ever again. Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development.

If you want to see a good gangster film then personally I recommend watching 'The Departed' as it does have the same sought of Genre and does everything right in terms of it's interesting story telling between these two men which at times does have lot's of quirky but violent scenes in which is done perfectly right rather than have old men constantly talk non stop about mundane meaningless ideals.

I give the Godfather a 7/10

Alex Rabbitte"
3,Schmaltzy family epic,"This is a movie for people who want to watch fat guys eat pasta.

""The Godfather"" confuses sentiment with emotion and nostalgia with authenticity. Like ""Goodfellas"", it tries to capture something deep and meaningful about loyalty, family, and honor, but in the end manages only to convey that food plays an important role in Italian culture.

Brando's portrayal of Corleone becomes farcical as his brooding look tips over into a vacant stare.

In all fairness this is not an altogether bad movie, but it pales in comparison to the novel by Mario Puzo and deserves to be taken down a notch.

Watch this for the costumes."
10,One of the greatest films ever made,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 41 years old and has aged well.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
10,Notes to the Soundtrack,"I think the best attribute to this movie is the atmosphere it holds. A large amount of credit to that is due to the wonderful soundtrack. It's simple tunes represent the romantic, mysterious, dangerous life of the mafia. It adds effect at the right times to make the memorable scenes even more memorable. But the real reason I'm writing this isn't to rate the movie because I'm horrible at writing reviews. The purpose of this comment is for anyone who loved the movie that plays a musical instrument and is interested in learning a few ditties. It's not much but here are the notes to what I call The Godfather Theme.

10,Drug life masterpiece,"Unlocks the raw reality of the life and lifestyle of a notorious drug king pin. Acting, choreography and directing impeccable."
10,don of all movies,"I am Italian and i love movies. This movie creates a standard in which all movies should be based by. Awesome character depth, and their chemistry is perfect. Al Pacino gives an all time great performance and they should name the Oscar after him. thats right call it Al Pacino, cause Oscar is a stupid name. i love this movie and i think everyone should sit down and enjoy in at least once in their life. this is a great movie...white power. This movie is mafangool, which is Italian for bacon. No charcoal brickets should be able to see this movie. Moulians are to dumb to understand anything Italian's do. I give this movie a ten because i love it. I love sitting down and eating popcorn and watching this movie. I even like eating twizlers as well, cause they are juicy and tasty. They remind me of lips and i like to suck on them. I love movies so much and thank god for them."
10,the best,"This is one of the best movies about mafia and the best movie about American mafia. It explain all the infrastructure of how things work and it is focus on the characters, what people in that time where and what they feel.

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino they play excellent in this. This is the role that launch Al Pacino career.

It is remarkable how Francis Ford Copola show the 2 faces of people: one that show to all the family's, the business man, the good guy and the real face of mafia the brutal one, that how they really ware.

On top of that it is technically meticulous, marvelously photographed, wonderfully lit, beautifully scored and contains several of the greatest performances and cinematic moments of its era"
9,A Legacy of Power and Tragedy in The Godfather,"The Godfather brilliantly captures the Corleone family's struggle between loyalty and survival. When Don Vito's stance against the narcotics trade leads to violent conflict with rival families, his son Michael, once an outsider, is pulled into the mafia world. Michael's transformation from reluctant son to ruthless leader is a haunting portrayal of the corrupting influence of power. In the end, he consolidates his control with brutal precision, but at the cost of his own humanity and family connections. Coppola's masterpiece remains a powerful exploration of ambition, loyalty, and the price of family legacy."
9,Great,"An absolute must see. Even if you aren't the crime movie type, the Godfather is a showcase of what amazing writing, great acting and a brilliant score can do when put together. The movie has captured a great feel for the time and left lasting impressions. The story and characters were more than enough to immerse you into this criminal world and keeps you glued to the screen and on the edge of you seat, waiting to see what comes next. It is a brilliant starting point in this trilogy/ The filming in terms of costumes and settings should not be overlooked as these things played a major part in it's beauty."
7,Good for its time,I didn't grow up then but in the modern era having now watched this film it's no 10. The acting is overdone and the multiple characters dropping like flies makes it hard to keep up.
10,My Favorite Movie,"I have actually already posted a review of The Godfather but my ID was erased for some reason (emfern13). So on with the review. The Godfather is the best Mafia film ever made and also the best film ever made period. The acting is fantastic. Marlon Brando is brillianty as Vito Corleone aka The Godfather. Al Pacino is great as Michael but why is he a Supporting Role? James Caan is excellent, a standout performance as the hot tempered Santino.

The acting is also helped by a fantastic script and masterful direction. 10 out of 10."
10,Classic,"One of the best movie ever made! Very good story, good actors and what a movie!"
8,Fantastic!!,"""The Godfather"" has become a classic in the 28 years since its release. It's definitely a great movie, that hasn't lost any of it's brilliance. The problems of Don Vito's life are still strong today, especially the issue of drugs.

Marlon Brando gives an Oscar-winning performance as the patriarch of a Mafia family, Don Vito Corleone. There are also incredible performances by Al Pacino and James Caan, who play Corleone's two sons, Michael and Sonny. Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.

Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), ""The Godfather"" has become a staple in my house. I think it's a movie that everyone should see, and I think many people will agree. Therefore, I give this flawless work a 10."
9,Coppola's Iconic Film,"Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own.

The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place.

Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot.

Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel.

The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments.

How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores.

Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labeled as their most strongest in their career.

This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel."
10,Best of '72 & Superb Brando!,"Francis Coppola's best film that deserved more than it's 3 Oscars (especially with CABARET winning 8 that year). James Caan is feisty, belligerent and passionate as Sonny, Al Pacino is introspective and brooding as young Michael, John Cazale is awkward and insecure as Fredo, Robert Duvall in quietly intelligent,and Brando kicks butt in one of his finest characters. A wonderful supporting cast, especially Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire and Richard Castellano.

Nobody expected much from this adaptation of Mario Puzo's pulp novel, but it was worth all the trouble Francis went through (hiring Brando and Pacino, not filming in St. Louis..etc.etc). Brilliant cinematography by the ""Prince of Darkness"" Gordon Willis, great music by Nino Rota, and a great family American tale of loyalty, business, and capitalism. A 10 out of 10!"
10,A classic Godfather,"Plot Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally pursued when he refuses to Sully the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour

The Godfather packs more into one gangster film than some genres output over decades. It is a big film with big themes, has memorable characters and lines. Mario Puzo novel once again proves that he's the master of storytelling — and Francis Ford Coppola of thrillingly violent filmmaking. With its all star cast this should go straight to the head of the list of essential viewing. With a classic sequel also to view. You will rarely get it so good.

Makes Bernard Mungeam 5 star films"
6,Is it really that good? Is it overrated?,"Is it really that good?

Is it overrated?

As a film that presents it as a gangster film, I would say that it is not overrated and that the plot is much more elaborate and tense than, for example, ""Goodfellas"". But if the film is viewed from the aspect of drama or crime films, it lacks a slightly more detailed plot that will still bring something into your memory that you will not forget for many years.

As for the director's imagination and acting...

Director Francis Ford Coppola chose a top-notch production and added ""flavor"" to the film with the help of photography and music. This can be seen already at the beginning of the film during the wedding, where you can see that the photography is phenomenal and that every frame of the film is superb for the year 1972. The music accompanies every slightly tense part of the film and calms down with Italian notes during calm frames. Those two aspects certainly give the film an additional charm, and in that regard it can definitely be called a classic.

The acting of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and others is outstanding and fully harmonizes with the theme of the film (which is the life of a Corleone mafia family).

All in all, the film is a classic that can definitely be seen because it is different from others for that time, but I still think it is a little overrated because I don't see a single plot that I could tell others to watch."
1,"Tell me, it's just a joke.","Godfather having score 9,1 and being 2nd best movie in IMDB? Yeah, good acting and plot twist, but it's just 6,0 movie. I don't think it's even a good movie."
9,The best mafia movie of all time,"This movie is awesome in every detail . The actors make the best movie ever. The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando."
10,The re-release of the masterpiece,"I consider this movie as one of the best movies of all time and used to watch it on tv and I was really excited to re-watch the 50 years old movie in cinema ! And to be honest this is the best re-release I have ever seen.

50 years old movie with better quality than modern some modern movie Recommendation: go and watch it in the cinema..it's a masterpiece hands down."
10,Great Master Peace,"This is the most Original movies ever made! Nothing can beat it. Good actors. Good set up. Everything is GREAT! If you want to spend your time. Watch it! If you want to spend your money. buy it! You cant get better then this. All mafia movies don't get closer to this one. So don't think that other mafia movies are better. Al Pacino. he takes to whole movie over. It cant be better with him. This movie gets a lot of awards, and of it is old. For me it can have more awards then it already haves. This movie don't need any special effect. For its old fashion look it haves more character. Get it in the movie store fast if you can."
10,really amazing,the godfather is easily one of if not the best film in cinema history everyone gives great performances easily Marlon Brando and AL Pacino Frances ford Coppola directs the film well and everything is great the story is great and so is the film the story is convincing and many iconic performances and lines are featured James Caan and Robert Duvall give great performances the godfather truly deserves to be on the top of the greatest movie lists the plot interesting and manages to keep you watching throughout the film summary a stunning masterpiece that has changed movies forever and is easily going to be remembered forever the godfather is easily the best of the Trilodgy and was better than the best film of 1972 it could be the best film ever made the godfather is also good form watching before the godfather part 2
10,The Godfather is an OK flick.,"I see that this show is #2 on the list of successful movies at IMDb so it would be impossible for me to more flatter it. I saw this movie when I was in Junior High School. My parents were all about Law School at the University and my feeling was this was a hero movie about an outlaw.

There is a frightening scene in this movie about a horse's head being found in the bed of the Godfather's enemy's bed. Crossing the Godfather is forbidden, per Se, and he defends his Italian Mafia friends with a machine gun. And, I think it looked like a foreign film because it takes place in a rich castle on luxurious estate.

The Godfather character in this film was a likable, ""regular person's"" advocate. I had Italian people in my family (as well as Gangsters in my school). By the way, as a result of my literary studies, I have found God is synonymous with dog so Godfather is a derogatory slang term."
1,Respect the craft but it's overrated and I hate it,"Technically there's a lot in this movie that looks appealing, it's competently produced in many, many ways. But I hate every character in it with a burning passion and just want every single one arrested and sentenced to hard labor post-haste; their concerns in the movie are of absolutely zero concern to me as a viewer and every moment spent on their stories feels like a waste of my time. It doesn't help it's hard to hear a lot of the dialogue and it just rambles on and on and on and I literally CANNOT keep my brain tuned into what they say in this film. I have never finished this film because it is impossible for me to stay tuned into it and/or stay awake, and I love lots of long, slow films! It's also not like I'm opposed to gangster films; Casino, Miller's Crossing, and Road To Perdition are ranked very, very, very high in my list of all-time favorite movies. The fact that this remains at or near the top of the IMDb ranking is proof positive that groupthink is alive and well amongst the movie reviewers. I would literally rank 1000 other movies I've seen above this, including many so-called ""bad"" movies because they're genuinely entertaining and The Godfather is pointless time-wasting misery."
10,MASTERPIECE !,"Great scenario, perfect fiction, very good acting... A complete masterpiece..."
10,A masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself with The Godfather, probably the greatest movie in cinema history. Marlon Brando shows us his magnificent skills and his way of dominating the scene. The Don's relationship with his family is unique and incredibly well depicted. Looking at Brando's career, which is frighteningly impressive, to say the least, the role of Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt his best one. To say that Al Pacino was incredible in this movie and the rest of the trilogy would be an understatement. James Caan, in the role of Sonny, comes right after Brando and Pacino's stunning performances. Truly a masterpiece, The first part of this epic trilogy will forever be at the very top of my list."

10,Godfather never gets old.,"This movie is a classic. When you think of all time best movies Godfather definitely comes to mind. The director, writers, actors & everyone else who had a part in making this movie are genius's. I think Godfather will be a classic 100 years from now. I just called 4 people & asked my husband the same question. ..""What are the top 3 best mob or gangster movies of all time? "" They ALL said Godfather & Scarface. 2 said Good fellows too. So it's not just my opinion. A lot of people know that this movie was one of the best movies ever! I may not be a movie critic or an actor, my daughter is an actor though & I know that ever since she has been acting, I actually pay attention to if someone really is a good actor or not & Godfather is full of awesome actors. After sitting in on many acting classes with my daughter I can tell a great actor! Thank you for making such a classic movie that will never get old. No matter how many times you watch it, it never gets old."
6,I lived the life hence my score!,I was actually married to someone in the same position when we went to see the Godfather and I'm afraid my review is marred by my experience. So much of the movie was ridiculous while some parts were accurate. I didn't enjoy watching this due to being involved in what was being glamorised on the big screen.. I found the mafia ISNT the highly regarded organisation it claims to be. I was told over and over they never hurt the innocent and there is a lot of honour in the mafia which I discovered is untrue. The backstabbing and lying even among family members is shocking and there is no honour.. absolutely none!
9,A Tour de Force,"The Godfather is not a perfect film. It is similar to the original Star Wars in that while it's flawed, its originality and cultural impact cannot be overlooked.

This film creates a dark and realistic atmosphere that lays the frame for a story filled with love, betrayal, and plenty of twists along the way. While the slower pace and dialogue-driven plot isn't for everyone, those who have the patience and attention to detail will not be disappointed."
10,GOD of all MAFIA movies,"This is my first review. After watching Godfather,i started to see all gangster movies but no movies can match its quality.This is one of my all time favorite. Al Pacino's performance is mind blowing. When you're watching you feel like you're one of the members in the family. Marlon Brando's quiet and confident mafia boss character is impressive. The soundtrack of the movie is delightful. All characters are correctly fitting to the script and is developed beautifully. Francis Ford Coppola really made a good film out of Mario Puzo's novel. This movie stands at the top in all decades.

I highly recommend this movie to all movie fans. I rate it 10 out of 10"
10,"Great film, very dramatic, great performances!","This movie has the right to be #1 in the top 250 from IMDb. Meta's have given it a 100/100 rating and the users have given it a solid 9,2. This film has been made with exceptional eye for detail and great artistic performances. You have to listen very well and keep concentrated every second of this film, because everything seen and heard appears to be a vital bit of information. It is the best movie ever made, with some of the best actors to have ever lived. Marlon Brando is a triple-A class actor and he shows it in this masterpiece. This is one of Al Pacino's first movies and he definitely left his mark, his performance has opened many doors for him, but most of all, it made the best movie ever!"
10,Greatest movie ever made.,"This is not just movie, it is an emotion. The dialouges are very comfortable. the acting level is incomparable."
10,Legendary,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" will remain an icon in movie history forever. It gives the audience what few films ever have; flawless and poetic storytelling. The script by Mario Puzo and Coppola (based on Puzo's masterful novel) is beat-by-beat perfect. It is also a study in the form of directing at its best. The legendary performances hold nothing back. It is the kind of movie that film students should be required to watch, because it is one of the few examples of flawless film-making in world history.

""The Godfather"" tells us the story of the aging Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Don of an organized crime family in New York. The film is about the decisions he makes for family, love, and business. Whether or not that business is legal. Just as equally, it tells the story of the Godfather's son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who doesn't wish to become part of his father's dirty business, but finds it hard to choose between right and wrong when it comes to family, pain, and suffering. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy. A tragedy about two family members who love one another, their wives, and their children, but are corrupted by the life around them. This film is also about that ""life"" around them, and the people organized crime affects. No matter what country. No matter when. It takes its toll.

Marlon Brando, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives us one of the best on-screen performances of our time. Do not make the mistake, however, of thinking he is the main character. He shares the spotlight, very much so, with Al Pacino's Michael. Pacino gives us a career-making performance that will make your eyes widen. It's almost hard to believe he about lost his job, but with Coppola's persistence, the producers agreed to keep him on. Robert Duvall plays the family's lawyer and adviser, and adopted son to Vito Corleone. He gives one of his earlier, best performances in this movie. James Caan hits all the right notes as ""Sonny,"" Michael's brother, who handles his power with rough hands. A man, who, if he feels is right, will let you know about it. Whether by talking or through violence. Who can forget Diane Keaton? She plays Michael's wife. Who starts out in love, but may end up confused and startled. A terrific performance. There is also Talia Shire as Sonny and Michael's sister, Connie. She may make several mistakes, but is open, and worried about her life to come.

Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola derived a fabulous script from a fabulous book. The dialogue rings true. It is deep and emotionally complex. It gave light to a gangster picture none had ever seen before. It was drafted like no other.

Coppola is a rare storyteller. As director, he lead us into a world few knew about back then (or now), and did it accurately. His vision is tremendous, and few can even imagine what it must be like to have his talents.

Overall, the picture, without a doubt, is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, and are doubtful of all of its awards and reviews, thinking that it might be overrated; don't. If anything, its underrated. Amazing."
6,A triumph,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.

It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in."
3,i don't get it,honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! i would've enjoyed it more if it was shorter. i really don't get how its one of the most talked about movies of all time. i rated it 5 after watching but i'm giving it a 3 now. and i'm pretty sure i'm never gonna complete the second and third films.
9,nice,This film is very nice . The godfather is reality life and reality mind I think. It's a good artist and good write . A group of Turkish police called in to a desolate area stumble upon a squalid and blood-soaked den of satanic ritual... Baskin is a visceral trip into the darkest pits of a very palpable evil.A group of Turkish police called in to a desolate area stumble upon a squalid and blood-soaked den of satanic ritual...

10,One of the best,"Well, there is pretty little to say about the bad side of the film, but about the good ones a lot can be said. The story was amazing, ahead from most of its time. The pacing was also incredible, one that wouldn't put you through boredom. I think as a film student, the film should be used as a study case for those who would like to write stories that could be translated into films. The actors were good as well especially the main character; one would have to watch to understand. How the dialog is held and how it translates to the character of the individuals in the film. The cinematography was fantastic; well I look up to be one so in short there use of color, shots, light is what makes the story even more interesting. I love the depth of their blacks and how they use the warm tones to convey some emotions and moods in the film. In short the film should be used widely in film schools for multiple purposes in the film industry."
9,I liked it,"Pretty good movie, its enjoyable, it works.

I love crime movies, if you like crime movies, you'll like this movie too."
10,I used to think its a boring movie...until I watch it again.,"It's a thick character-based plot line. Just because there's not an explosion every 3 minutes doesn't make a movie boring. It makes it a drama. It's a genre that doesn't generally feature giant explosions and shoot-outs, because the conversations are where the real action is happening. If you don't like that kind of movie, you're not going to like The Godfather. I seen this movie before but I use to think its was boring but now I become a little mature and give a chance again and now I know that I was wrong about this but I just sit and watch the whole movie and it was great. I even watched part 2 and part 3. The Story is great and Acting is great too. You need to sit down and watch this movie carefully but its not for everyone. So Far its one of the best movies I seen. Plus it got great actors like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall etc."
7,Mob movie,"If you like mob movies, I guess this movie is for you but if you not be cautious. It is bloody and sad. It has a lot of themes and colors to describe the story, which is very interesting. If you really like this movie, I would recommend The Road to Pedition with Tom Hanks. It is not as bloody as this movie but it has a good plot. Godfather has a good plot but for me, it is just too much to handle. The movie would probably get away without so much blood but I guess you have to be realistic. I probably wouldn't watch this movie if I didn't take humanities, which is one of the requirements for my associates degree. Although my brother would eventually make me watch since he is a big mob fan."
1,Boring,"I watched this movie two days ago, after seeing the rating which is quit remarkable but in the reality this movie sucks.

There are a lot of other options to watch so do not waste your time here."
9,I like it,Nice Movie! I love this film so much. The Godfather is the best series i have ever seen.
10,"The Third best movie of all time, and the best gangster movie of all time","The BEST Mob movie of all time. With all the Drama Character changes from beginningto end and the performances done by the cast makes the movies just Breathtaking. This movie was released on March 24th 1972. Even that early in the year you knew that is was going to be the best movie of the year and that Marlon Brando had the best performance all year. It was such a good movie that before they finished filming they planned The Godfather Part II. Another good thing about this movie is that even though there is countless mistakes it is still number 3 on America's Film Instunte's Top 100 movies of all time. Fred Roos,Andrea Eastman, and Louis DiGiaimo did a fantastic job on casting Marlon Brando,Morgana King,James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Al Pachino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and as well as countless others in casting for this movie."
10,Good,"I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."
10,THE MOST PERFECT MOVIE EVER,"The Godfather is not only one of the best and most memorable movies, but also one of the most beautiful movies in history. The film, which is not only full of power struggles and betrayals, but also shows a family that is always behind each other. A father who, while being the biggest criminal in the city, loves his children so much that he is ready to kill the whole city by losing one of them, but for the sake of the other children, he forgives his son and finally dies playing with his grandson. And of course, in the end, his little boy takes revenge on the whole family in the best possible way and becomes the first power again. You know, the godfather is a combination of blood and love. And if we want to describe it in one sentence, we can only say: THE MOST PERFECT MOVIE EVER"
10,amazing,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
10,Spine chilling,"Francis ford Coppola's 'Godfather'....this along with its 1974 sequel is movies at its very best.....this is a near perfect movie...I know this has been said a number of times by a lot of people but for once I feel most of them are right. There are a lot of memorable scenes which stay with you long after you have seen it...and I think that is the reason why this is probably the best movie on organized crime, because it haunts you long after you have seen it. Marlon Brando as don Vito corleone is excellent, for which he well deservingly received an Oscar. Al pacino's Michael corleone for me is the most memorable character in the whole of film history, both cold blooded ruthless villain and a tragic hero at the same time, pacino mostly emotes through those eyes of his and his subtle, measured yet explosive performance is responsible for why people keep going back to godfather and try and interpret and justify each of his character's nuances...separate mention for the memorable sequences which Coppola designs...the sepia toned photography and nino rota's hauntingly beautiful score. After mentioning so much, I still remain doubt what makes this movie so great and arguably the greatest motion picture of all time...I guess that is the way with iconic movies...you never know what's the best thing in it yet you keep going back to it again and again...like an offer you can't refuse!"
7,Great movie but extremely overrated,"The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and that's fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesn't give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you don't doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. It's such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow."
1,What is the appeal of grand failure?,"I really don't understand people sometimes. Here we have the #1 rated movie on the list. An extremely famous film. A well made film in it's own right. But the story. It's AWFUL.

This is a story about a man how starts off as a fine upstanding citizen, a soldier, no less, and his gradual change into what I can only describe as a Total S**t.

I really did NOT like this movie. I did like it up to a point...once I realized that Michael was not going to overcome his demons.

I really don't feel I should waste any more time on this film, so I won't."
10,The Greatest Movie I have ever seen,"The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever.

10,Excellent Movie,"Ever since i watched this movie i have loved it, every detail of the movie keeps me intrigued. Its sad in todays society that many people cant sit through such an amazing movie because they get bored so easily. Everyone needs to be constantly entertained, if you are a person like that you shouldn't watch this movie. If you love movies and have a fine appreciation for it you will find this to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is brilliant, the music keeps you dazzled and the drama keeps you into the movie the whole way through. After i saw this movie i had to see every Al Pacino film and i think this may have been his best performance of his career, and Francis Ford Copla set a standard with movie making, one which i hope to follow in my quest to become a director and a screen writer."
8,Epic,Hands down one of my favorite films/story. The transformations of characters throughout the film is shown so well visually.
9,Write a headline for your review here,"In addition to watching the film I also read his novel, what I find interesting in this story is how a twelve-year-old child survived the mob run, until he could become a businessman and a mob leader"
10,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""","The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form.

It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.

When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence.

The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather.

Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him.

Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years.

But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen. It's for this reason that it has become timeless, representing a masterclass in filmmaking and reminding us all of the innovation that makes us love cinema."
10,A film that will stand up to time,"When you think of the top 25 films of all time, they have one thing in common. You could have seen them when they first came out or your children's children can be viewing them, and they will still give the same long lasting impression. They may encourage you/your children to get into film or entertainment, they make you think. They keep you talking well after you've seen the film not once, not twice, but for a long time. There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films.

I was too young to see it once it came out, but I read alot of movie magazines at the time about it as well as grabbing a copy of the Mario Puzio book. My first full length view of ""The Godfather"" was on...yep, you guessed it, the ""Z"" channel in Los Angeles in the 1980's. It grabbed me and never let go.

The Godfather has everything in it that a movie going public would like to see, and the rare thing is -- it's all in one movie.

It deals with family, the relationship of sons and their placement IN a family, it has violence -- that's for sure, mystery, romance, corruption, suspense. It has a story, surprises. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery and sets are wonderful.

This was 1972 and NOTHING like this was put together/filmed at the time. The early 70's gave alot of film makers chances, some good, some spectacular -- and most of all a legend for future film makers and entertainers to look at, hold in esteem and copy (which is the best form of flattery.)

Don't get me wrong, there are many 'gangster-type' films out there that kick-butt (thanks to James Cagney, Edward G. and a host of others) , but this one...flowed. It really isn't all about the violence, but legacies, how violence begats violence and a look inside a ""family"" maternal and extended and what they would do to survive. The rivalries between ""families"". This is why ""The Godfather"" ranks in the top 7 of the best movies of all time among the majority.

Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert DuVall and an ecclectic, well cast group of actors and actresses and Production crew brought this to life. Regardless of how YOU may feel personally about the ""portrayal"" of the ethnicity of the characters, this film MAKES you wonder, makes you feel, makes you angry, makes you cry, makes you respond.

The Godfather is one of the best films ever made."
10,Truly one of the greatest films of all time!,"Most film critics say that 'The Godfather' is one of the greatest films of all time, and I agree with them.

First of all, i'd like to say this is Marlon Brando's best performance yet! Al Pacino had a stupendous performance too, alongside legends like Robert Duvall and James Caan.

The writing was good all-in-all which made it an Oscar, the violent scenes were action packed but blood baths (so don't watch it with children). Francis Ford Coppola did everything to make this a great movie so kudos to him.

All-in-all this is a must see movie before you die, I hope there will be more movies as good as this."
3,Why wasn't it Anthony Quinn?,"I'm not really the target audience for The Godfather franchise, but I did go into the movies with an open mind. After all, I love heavily dramatic, soapy stories, I recognize the quality of the cast, and my mother's side of the family comes from Sicily. With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?

I'm not a fan of violence, but ironically, the version of The Godfather that I saw had been edited for appropriate television audiences. Much of the blood and violence was cut out, the swear words were muffled, and the sex scenes were deleted. The movie was only an hour long-just kidding! I don't know how or why this movie became so legendary, since to me, it felt like a B-picture starring a bloated, tired, low-energy Marlon Brando. This felt like a typical '70s movie, or an '80s television movie, with cheap production values and a has-been lead. I'll never, never understand why Marlon Brando was cast as the title role, and why, after his performance was seen during rehearsals, he wasn't replaced by someone else. Why wasn't Anthony Quinn, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Kirk Douglas, Vincent Gardenia, Burt Lancaster, Anthony Franciosa, Joseph Calleia, John Marley, or Ben Gazzara cast? Any of them would have been more menacing, more Italian, and had a more commanding presence. Most of these men made their own ""Godfather knockoff"" in the ensuing years. Marlon Brando - who, despite the sound of his last name, is not Italian - must have patterned his famous, never-endingly mimicked accent after a friend, but among my Sicilian family line, and meeting people during my trips to Italy, no one has sounded even remotely like the cotton-mouthed, whispering, jaw-jutting ""Italian"" accent.

I doubt I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Godfather or its sequels, but those of us who aren't fans are certainly quiet. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm sure you'll want to at least try it out, since there are so many famous moments to the first movie. There's the offer, the cannoli, the bag of fruit, the car bomb, the fishing trip, and of course, the horse's head. Marlon Brando scratches his jowls, James Caan is a royal jerk, and Al Pacino explains the difference between personal and business. But most importantly, there's tons of self-importance and an almost tongue-in-cheek seriousness that begs the question, why were there two sequels?

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
10,The Ultimate Perfection.,"""The Godfather"" is the perfect film. The 1970s was the greatest decade in the history of motion pictures for turning out masterpieces. Above all else, what captures the viewers in this movie--arguably the decade's premier masterpiece--is the stark dichotomy of family bonds versus terrible betrayal. ""The Godfather"" causes viewers to be enthralled by the harshest possible realization of moral relativism that could possibly be imagined. But admittedly, it is our connection to and fascination with the Corleone family--every bit as dysfunctional, violent, and disturbing as one would picture an organized crime family to be--that makes this film only more beloved and respected as the years pass on. For example, when fans of the film discuss what they love about the movie, the expected level of disturbing violence in it is rarely mentioned as being remarkable. What fans remember most is the great writing and the spectacular performances. Fans are thrilled to see a dark side of American life from a distance and that very few people ever see all while they root for their beloved Corleones. ""The Godfather"" has stood the test of time, and it always will."
10,a short comment,"It will not take very long: The Godfather is just...THE MOVIE. It's not my favorite movie, it's not the funniest movie I've ever seen or that of which I remember the dialogues as if I had studied them, but there's no single movie since 1972 (and maybe before) that hasn't taken something of it. It's poetry in motion, it's tender, wild, violent...again, it's THE MOVIE."
10,An enduring classic,"Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top 100), `The Godfather' brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family. America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this film takes us inside `the family' like never before.

The script is nearly flawless. The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets up. The story is mesmerizing. The characters are so carefully and intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with them. Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.

However, the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and the actors who played them. The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another. They have such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence. We come to understand that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.

Though this was more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out, namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Brando was already an established superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few years. His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding. Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See `On The Waterfront', `A Streetcar Named Desire', or `Mutiny On The Bounty'), yet it is the one for which he is most famous. Brando redefined our notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary. He presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other families.

Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to his credit at that time. Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a great deal of range. Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching romantic interlude along the way. Pacino shined in every scene and established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.

Other standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the hot headed Sonny Corleone. Caan's performance was raw, brutal and visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming character with a strong sense of family loyalty.

This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for Brando and Best Picture. It is one of the very few videos that I actually own. It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see. It is an utterly perfect 10."
10,THE GODFATHER,"The Best ""Mob Movie"" Of All Time. It Will Make You An Offer That You Can't Refuse."
10,Perfection,"Of you didn't like this movie, just go and play hockey because you don't know anything about the cinema"
8,Epic,"It is no wonder that the milestone tamil movies like Pudhupettai & Chekka Chivantha Vaanam were heavily inspired from it. The movie starts with an astounding performance of a guy who later is magnified with few events/dialogues and gets introduced to us as a Gangster/Don/GodFather, although the movie feels more dramatic with a whole lot of family/dramatic scenes, it never keeps us unengaged and later when the unexpected hierarchy of kid gets to pick up the left overs by the big guy with a parallel eventful formation of a new don built upon the legacy of it as the climax forms the crux for its series as a whole."
10,The quintessential mobster film,"The Godfather is a movie about gangsters. But more importantly, it's a film about gangsters that are also real people, with real relatives and family. The Godfather has all the makings of brilliant movie.

The casting is classic with Marlon Brando's unforgettable interpretation of Vito Corleone and the level-headed and dark character of Michael, played by Al Pacino also in the film's two sequels. Aside from great characters the story, pacing and structure of the film has been designed in a way, that even after 2 hours of watching the same movie you still don't feel exhausted like you would with the 2+ hour epics of Peter Jackson.

The movie is also incorrectly said to be dark and gory. Certainly the darkness is warranted, but the gore is set in the film rather sparingly and I would reckon the gore in the two later films much more disturbing, even if it's not as extensive. The violence is here to remind of us of the gritty reality of the film's world and it works in a same way as the great family-celebrations bring out the happier and lighter side of the life of a gangster.

On all levels The Godfather is a brilliant picture. It's brilliantly acted, cast, directed and written. It is a movie with an old-timesy feel that feels fresh each time you watch it."
9,Gangster Crime Drama Film,"This is the 2nd best movie of all time as per IMDB.

An italian-American gangster family fallen on a difficult situation after ignoring crime business with other notorious family. Don Vito Corleone who was the main GODFATHER had to change his rule to one of his son.

After that a lot of changes happened to the family.

What changes happened after? Who became the Godfather?

You have to see this film to know about these answers.

My personal Rating is 9.00 out of 10.00

7,A classic that drags its heals,"There is no doubt what so ever that the godfather is a classic film. Hell, some even say its the best film ever made. I on the other hand, think its a great film with some flaws.

Being at the tender age of 23, i watched the godfather in its entirety for the first time today. Having seen the complete film, but only in segments, watching it from beginning to end, i found myself enjoying this classic film, but often getting board at the same time.

The problem with the film, (if you could call it a problem) is that, its mostly talk. Sure, there's the ocasional gun play, or graphic scene (the horse head is classic) but, compared to scarface, goodfellas, and even the sopranos, it lags by comparison. People want to have a good story and godfather delivers up an offer you cant refuse (im sorry i had to say it), but, its just dull in spots compared to other gangster classics.

Overall i found godfather to be a prime example of storytelling and acting, and it deserves every award and honor its receved, but in my book, it fails to over throw the don of gansta films, Scarface (1983)"
1,Overrated..,"I have never been able to watch this movie to the end, tried to watch it couple of times and fell asleep everytime. I think this film is just too long and boring. I can't understand how can someone think it's the best movie ever."
10,An offer you can't refuse,"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino need I say more!

Totally an amazing film by Mr Francis Ford Coppola. I watched it once and was left sat there amazed at how good a film it was as i cryed out for more. No other gangster film is as good although Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction are very close.

It leaves other gangster films sleeping with the fishes."
10,"""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.""","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people (even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable!

Overall rating: 10 out of 10."
10,A Timeless Snapshot of Another World,"The Godfather is rightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, and this review won't seek to be a mere repetition of its finest qualities. Technically, thematically and theatrically, the film is an undeniable masterpiece. It took what is an enjoyable, but pulpy, populist crime novel into a deft piece of art. One can only attempt to highlight some interesting observations here.

Watching this again recently with friends who have never seen it before is an interesting experiment. After seeing the film numerous times one forgets that the story and the characters, while never particularly convoluted, are nevertheless numerous, steeped in a subtly defined hierarchy that for the uninitiated is overwhelming, to say the least. Especially overseas (Britain in this case), the younger generation have to fill in gaps that would have been closer to common knowledge upon release in the US. Notwithstanding its wide berth of characters and relationships, the film's central arc, that of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) descent to Don, is never clouded; Part II, while arguably as good if not better than Part I, suffers initially from juggling multiple arcs that while well-crafted and excellent, are not nearly as accessible.

While all remember the set pieces, particularly the wedding and baptism that masterfully bookend the film, on multiple viewings it's the quieter, thematic scenes that really shine. A personal favourite scene is the last scene shared between Michael and Vito (Marlon Brando) discussing Vito's desires for Michael, which merges duty, family and aspiration in a truly touching scene. One can make a serious argument that The Godfather Saga is really an embodiment of the American dream (note the Statue of Liberty in the 'cannoli' scene background), and Vito's entire outlook captures this. The scene is certainly the thematic backbone of the movie.

What has been occasionally discussed in detail elsewhere, but deserves a mention, is the portrayal of Kay. It's a nuanced performance by Diane Keaton, and the costume design is a fantastic touch. In her scenes where she is most distant, Kay's colours are bright reds and oranges, in sharp contrast to the surrounding characters (the wedding; when she looks for Michael at the compound). As she falls in with the family, her colours become muted. In terms of gender portrayal (something the film almost-understandably struggles with; it never comes close to passing the Bechdel test), Kay certainly fares better as a character than Apollonia, who is little more than an object of desire. Her willingness to be there for Michael is almost questionable however. Yet, ultimately this is a quintessential story about men, in a world where women had not yet encroached as individuals separate from men (it's no accident that the women get a greater role in Part III). One can suggest that the fact that all the women are defined by their male connections is less the fault of the material than it is the reality of the profession and period.

The Godfather, possibly by virtue of being a period piece, has barely aged in 40 years. Sure, the issues it discusses and the world it portrays are transformed, but like a painting it captures beautifully a freeze frame, a snapshot period of aspiration and ambition. It will continue to be adored for years to come."
8,"It's good, but not great","A very good film. Good story and good acting and directing.

But it's not the best Gangster film ever made.

That award goes to the Director's cut of Once Upon a Time in America. It's a film that has much more depth to it than does The Godfather.

The Godfather is an entertaining evening, but it doesn't move you. You don't really care about any of the characters---they are all just psychopaths with no depth to them. We hardly even known Vito Corleone's wife, for example.

Terrific story, but nothing with much depth. They are gangsters and nothing more. It's a move about 'business"" but not about what life would have really been like for them. People die, ho hum. Do we really miss any of them as people? For your sake, I hope not."
10,The Godfater is the best movie of all time,"i start loving it when i play the game in ps2.then i start reading the novel and watch the movie.this is the first time i go crazy about a movie.i give 2 thumbs up 4 this movie and also 2 Mario Puzor who had created such a goo story about mafia in America....the best is the actor who really protre the character.the story line is imprasive.i like everything in the movie.godfather is such a big imfluance in those day.sometime i myself also imagine i'm like godfather rich everybody respect n care.the action in this movie really amaze me in every way.at the toll booth scene,i never expect that is a ambush.i think this movie is my all time favorite.."
6,Where to start,"Possibly one of the most overhyped movies I've ever watched, don't get me wrong that doesn't mean it's bad, I just think the reputation it holds is too big, I'm sure for when it came out it would be considered a masterpiece but now in 2021 I wouldn't say so

I thought the performances were really good from most of the actors especially Brando. The story was fairly straight forward and there was little action, and the dialogue through the movie was quite bland

The movie had some stand out scenes which I won't spoil but honestly, if I had never watched this movie I wouldn't feel like I was missing out, 6/10."
1,Quite an interesting piece of film.,"I love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would, as ""normal"" people, never get the chance to know. It's a world full of traditions, family values, rich and explicit verbal and behavior language, but also a world of corruption, power, deceit and murder. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to create this Italian-American feeling throughout the whole movie, and it never feels superficial. It's a very good movie, but not extra-ordinary. I lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son Michael being dragged into the world of the mafia. It was a bit too easy. He gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop, and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody. I think I miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic. Anyway, trying to keep The Godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre. I think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position, so we can appreciate the film without all this hype. And we shouldn't be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years."
10,Saint Michael of Corleone,"As I see it, the story is usually read as the descent into evil of an innocent. But I seethe story of an innocent awakening to something that he must conclude. When Michael Corleone is in hiding in Sicily, he falls truly in love. He is very happy, when the life he is in hiding from reaches out to destroy his beloved. He sees that he can bring it to an end, and that he must do it. Even though he will have to assume a role immersed in this terrible world, and appear to do terrible things. He is a man who has seen his fate. In it's period context, this is an allegory of Europe realising that Fascism must be stopped.

This is the tragedy of The Godfather part 3; it was a wasted opportunity for a truly enlightening trilogy. I wish someone had pointed this out to Coppola."
10,Master Piece,"Watching The Godfather is an emotional experience unlike any other. It stirs something deep within me-a mix of awe, melancholy, and introspection. The film doesn't just tell a story; it pulls me into the world of the Corleones, making me feel the weight of their choices and the darkness that power inevitably brings. The portrayal of loyalty, betrayal, and ambition resonates on a profound level, leaving me questioning the balance between duty and desire.

Marlon Brando's presence as Vito Corleone evokes a sense of respect and fear, while Al Pacino's journey as Michael leaves me both fascinated and saddened by how power transforms him. Each scene, every whispered word and look, carries an emotional gravity that lingers long after the movie ends. It's not just a film-it's a reflection on the sacrifices made in pursuit of power and the unyielding ties of family, and it always leaves me feeling haunted and contemplative."
10,The Oscar-winning 1972 masterpiece about the Corleone family,"THE GODFATHER,"" which has been re-released on its 25th anniversary, is a jewel that still glows across time -- and in the dark. Gordon Willis's cinematography, considered revolutionary at the time, plunged its characters into pools of semi-darkness. Studio executives -- always the last ones to get it -- howled in the screening rooms. But in this saga of an Italian-American family's bid for power, we were watching the American Dream operating in the darkest shadows.

Luckily, America saw the light. The movie, released in March 1972 and directed by an unknown eccentric called Francis Ford Coppola, was a smash hit -- the first film to top $100 million in its initial release. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation). It lit a fire under the careers of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. It entered the pantheon of American cinema; and it has informed virtually every crime movie in the last quarter century, from ""Scarface"" to ""Donnie Brasco.""

In the story, which Mario Puzo and Coppola adapted from Puzo's novel, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) presides over a tight-knit clan which includes his hotheaded eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), his adopted son and family adviser, Tom Hagen (Duvall), and youngest son, Michael (Pacino), the apple of his father's eye who has -- thus far -- been kept out of the family business.

That business happens to be prostitution, protection rackets and gambling. In a constant struggle for power among New York's rival gangster families, Don Corleone rules with Machiavellian grace.

When adversaries refuse his wishes, he ""makes them an offer they can't refuse."" The procedure is simple: His goons point a gun against the head of anyone who needs persuasion. But Don Corleone is also a benevolent figure who -- in this morally relative underworld -- rights the wrongs of his friends and relatives.

Into this world comes Michael, the returning war hero (the year is 1946), who finally agrees to take his father's mantle and run the family. His ascension is the stuff of American cinematic myth. Standing before his father, who lies in a hospital bed after barely surviving an attempt on his life, Michael kisses Don Corleone's hand and whispers, ""I'm with you now.""

Coppola, then in his thirties, reluctantly heeded the advice of his friend George Lucas to make this picture. To him, this was a commercially unpalatable project that had nothing to do with his personal ambition: to change the way Hollywood made movies.

How wrong he was. There are volumes that could be written -- and have been -- about the movie's uniformly powerful performances; its precedent-setting editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; Nino Rota's haunting score; and Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design. But Coppola must get most of the credit.

With Puzo, he forged an epic tragedy about America, capitalism, family, greed, treachery and love. He showed us -- with almost Shakespearean gravitas -- the errors of hasty vengeance and the wisdom of assured leadership. He gave us a great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. There are too many to choose from, but I leave you with two here: When Michael -- hearing about the assault on his father -- scrambles into a telephone booth to call the family, his girlfriend (Diane Keaton) waits outside in the cold. It's clear that she's literally being kept out of the picture. Much later, when a door is closed between her and her husband -- as he conducts family business -- this estrangement is not only reconfirmed, it sets us up for ""The Godfather, Part II,"" a movie that achieved the impossible: to equal its predecessor."
10,The Godfather indeed!,"As much as I would like to do justice for this movie - there is little I can say that will help people understand the grandeur of this film. The Godfather sends you through a riveting journey into the life of one of the five great families. And with a cast as breathtakingly awe-inspiring as this, you are bound to be on the edge of your seat from the very first wedding scene.

The plot of the movie is in itself fantastic, but it should not go unmentioned how it is not only a good movie - but a very realistic depiction of the harsh life of the criminal organizations, and their internal structure based mostly on nepotism.

The soundtrack (which is too often ignored as an important aspect of storytelling in these reviews) by Nino Rota perfectly underlines the true sadness of this intricate storyline."
10,Awesome Or Perfect?,"Al Pacino,James Caan,Marlon Brando,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton...just perfect.Not only that it has the greatest actors ever,its story is perfect too.

Before the movie was even made one of the greatest actors auditioned for the casts.Did you know that Elvis wanted to play Michael Corleone? Even the music is perfect for the movie.Larry Kusic and Nino Rota composed the music for the movie.You need to have The love theme.Really Great.

Through the years Godfather got famous and even more.Everybody knows the movie,the actors,even the game which got released in 2006 (don't got it but maybe someday).

I recommend this movie to everybody who is into Crime,Drama,...and everybody who loves the acting of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."
1,Boooooring,"Title says it all.... This movie was long, and cut out the best parts of the book. It had a good cast, but that can't make up for poor transition from the novel. Bottom line: read the book, it's better."
10,"The Don of all Gangster Movies,","What can I write about this movie that you don't already know,released in 72 and still to this day the greatest Mafia movie made, strong cast and strong Scripts and when you have that combination you have a hit on your hands that can never be bettered, at the end the quote of the movie,Connie to Michael""did you kill him ,"" did you kill him Michael? he shouts back "" never ask me about my business"" then the pause and then the Answer "" NO "" she walks out and the door slowly closes and the audience cannot wait for more until we got GodFather 2, THAT IS FOR ANOTHER DAY,Al Pacino comes into his own in this movie and as for Marlon Brando excellent performance,I only wished they kept him alive a little for GodFATHER 2,"
10,The Greatest Crime Drama Ever Made,"This is by far the best Crime Drama ever made. It is much better than Goodfellas, which is good but it is a bit overrated. Marlon Brando is excellent in this movie. Although, sometimes I think of him as more of a supporting role than a leading role. He was still excellent. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all excellent in their supporting roles. I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in.

The acting is definitely a plus in the Godfather and so is its Directing. It also has one of the best scripts ever written. No flat Dialogue or any corny lines. This is and will remain the best Crime Drama ever made. Thats a promise."
10,Excellent!,"What can you say about a movie that has so many great and popular dialogue? A film that has a famous character. A film that is so powerful, moving, brilliant, innovative, and stunning?

Just one word: MASTERPIECE!

The Godfather is easily one of the greatest movies ever made! This movie is definitely in my top ten. Next to films like ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Goldfinger,"" and ""The Godfather, Part II."" This film like so many other classics has great direction, story line, character development, outstanding acting, and a great score.

****out of****stars"
10,The Two of Us,"I recently watched the 1968 French film ""The Two of Us"" directed by Claude Berri, which tells of the development of a relationship between an anti-Semetic old man in the country who becomes the guardian of a young Jewish boy during World War II. (Actually, the title of the French movie translates better to ""The Old Man and the Boy"".) To me, it appears that the scenes in ""The Godfather"" where Vito is an old man in a garden playing with a young boy with a spray can were very much informed by this French film. The film would certainly have been available to Coppola and Brando during the filming of ""The Godfather"". Although it may be stretching things a bit, the actor who portrays the old man in the French film has a very distinct chin, and it may be that Brando came up with the idea of putting tissues in his jowls from observing that actor. I wonder if others have spotted these similarities."
6,Meh,"It's alright, but I was expecting much better. Maybe I'll look back at this review in a few years time and kick myself for not getting 'the greatness' of this film. It just isn't as gripping as a film like goodfellas. I had to force myself to keep watching, but as it went on, it was less of a drag. A lot of good quotes that I actually have started to use to be fair to it"
10,The Godfather governs absolute,"There isn't much that hasn't already been said concerning the excellence of The Godfather. Nonetheless, I present the umpteenth dissertation on why not giving The Godfather four out of four stars is about as unjust as sentencing an innocent man to death.

Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 effort is truly an epic for the ages. The acting, directing, cinematography, score, and script are all of the highest possible calibermaking the near three-hour running time more of a blessing than an inconvenience. The Godfather is not only the Don of all Mafia melodrama, but it is also the standard grade of superiority for critics and filmmakers alike.

Based on Mario Puzo's bestseller of the same name, the story begins in 1945 at the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire), the daughter of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Even on his daughter's day of celebration, Don Vito still manages to take care of ""business."" After a few men grace his presence and ask for a few favors  revenge, a leading role, etc.  the Don unites with his family for the ceremony. His youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who has recently returned home from war a hero, brings his new love Kay (Diane Keaton), and the Don's two older sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), along with his ""adopted"" son and confidant Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), also come to celebrate their sister's special occasion.

With each of the five major mob families straining to gain ground on one another, the budding industry of narcotics presents a forum for a few to achieve a competitive advantage. However, it is Don Vito who declines Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), the drug supplier, of his offer to commence an involvement in narcotics trafficking. His son and heir apparent, Sonny, obviously disagrees with his father's choice  seeing that drugs are the wave of the future  but the Godfather does not concede. Don Vito understands that the drug industry is a cutthroat business where friends are few and far between. It is this rejection that spirals the Corleone family down a brutal one-way street that will both cost the five families many lives, and allow a new Don to emerge.

Al Pacino plays the supporting role of Michael with fire in his eyes. His transformation, from a civilian to a Godfather in both senses of the term, is the film's main and most dynamic storyline. In almost every sense, Pacino steals the thunder out from under Brando; nonetheless, Brando's role is perhaps the most iconic role in all of cinema. His character, styled after real life mobster Frank Costello, is one of the films many highlights.

Despite an unmistakable missed punch, a few continuity issues, and an abundance of character roles to keep straight, The Godfather remains one of the most influential films in cinematic history. Not only will Brando's husky whisper continue to be copied for generations to come, but also the only fruit that shares its name with its color will always signify an impending death or violent incident.

Aside from all of the orange metaphors, The Godfather's resounding themes on the duality of man  love and hate, good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, and family and violence  allow it to emit an atmosphere like no other film. The Godfather is the utter embodiment of the ultimate ""guy film"", yet whether you are a male or female or a frequent or infrequent moviegoer is not dependent on how much appeal you will hold towards this first-rate pulp crime drama. Regardless of your status, you will be taken aback by its magnificence.

On The Internet Movie Database's website, The Godfather is listed as the number one favorite movie of all time, and on The American Film Institute's chart of the ""100 Years100 Movies,"" it is listed as the number three greatest film. First or third, there is no question why The Godfather holds a spot on a myriad of Top 10 lists, mine included. It is a seminal classic that will only continue to steamroll sovereignty, praise, and admiration."
8,3 hours well spent,"I recently watched this film on Christmas Eve to pass some time before the big day and i can say i wasn't disappointing this film received 9.2 on this website which in my opinion is a bit overrated however it is still a hell of a movie the main plot behind this masterpiece is that ""The Godfather"" (Brando) is getting old and wants to pass on the family business to his son (Pacino)however Pacino is not to keen on it at first grows to understand what he must do. This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan & Talia Shire.

I highly recommend this movie so far i has seen this and The Godfather part 2 and they are both good films but i am yet to watch the 3rd one.

****/*****"
10,"Flawless, exciting... unique.","The year is 1970. F.F. Coppola has just directed ""The Rain People"" (1969), a good, but not great, movie, starring R. Duval and James Caan. Coppola is then offered to direct the Mario Puzzo best-seller, ""The Godfather"". Coppola accepts, but has his own suggestions for the leading roles: Marlon Brando shall incarnate Vito Corleone -the ""godfather"", while an unknown actor, someone called Al Pacino, is suggested for the most important role in the film; he'll play Michael Corleone, the second son of Vito, the soon-to-be godfather. Paramount isn't very keen of either suggestions. They'd prefer George C. Scott for the leading part and Dustin Hoffmann or Jack Nicholson for the role of Michael. Pacino is discarded for the unforgivable crime of being ""a midget"". Brando, the unconventional ""bad boy"", is out of question. Coppola finally got his way. Thankfully.

Also starring are former collaborators -see the ""Rain People""- R. Duval and James Caan, while there are also a few Coppola-family members contributing: Talia Shire, Coppola's sister, stars and Carmine Coppola, Francis' father, writes the music, along with long-time Fellini collaborator, Nino Rota. Sophia Coppola, the director's daughter, also known as a director herself, makes also a snapshot in the movie -she's the girl who's being baptized at the end of the film.

These were only unnecessary information. The point lies elsewhere: ""The Godfather"" is probably the best American movie of all times. It's not the flawless cinematography, nor the mesmerizing acting by all the actors. And it's not the simply breath-taking music score, or the amazing plot. It's the summary of all the above. It may sound childish, but I will say it: Everyone did their job splendidly.

To start with, the plot is fascinating. Brando is the mafia godfather, a Shakespearian figure, who dances on the edge of life and death and has to pay. It's notable, that the audience feels sorry and sympathy for him, although he is a sheer killer. ""We're not butchers, despite what this undertaker thinks"", implies Vito in the beginning of the film. Simply brilliant: A killer is thought to be one by an undertaker. Does it get any better? Apparently, yes. Vito is shot nearly dead by a rival family and Michael appears on the screen. Revenge, business, interest and death are the ingredients of the rest of the film.

Secondly, the acting is just sublime. Brando makes the best performance in his career -it's a draw with ""Apocalypse Now"". Caan is excellent, so's Duval. But the key-performance is the one from Pacino. He tries to evolve from a shy-idealist-soldier-boy to a coldblooded-evil-adult. And he succeeds. It's simply one of the very great performances ever.

Thirdly, the music can't get any better. Written in the motives of Fellini's movies, Rota did his best. Can't get bettered.

Finally, and most importantly, the cinematography stands above any criticism. There are so many memorable scenes: Brando's shooting, the wedding sequence, the Turk's murder by Pacino -this one's the key-scene of the film, the Sicily sequence, the scene in the garden between Vito and Michael, the ""double"" baptism, followed by the murders etc.

It lasts more then two-and-a-half hours. But it doesn't show. It's so unique, so fascinating, that you're gonna ask for more. Are you searching for a flawless film? Stop searching; you're in the right place. Highly, no, hugely recommended.

Thank you."
10,A Movie,At least it is touted that way. But can we appeal to someone who says it's a poem?
1,over rated,"The godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much. The roles of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated. The direction is good not excellent, the script is by no means ground breaking. But many people still refer to it as the best film ever made. Next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and wit(eg fight club) and more lavish directing."
10,gangster,"opularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible."
10,I have a new favorite movie,"For some inexplicable reason, I've always put off seeing this movie. I remember trying to watch it a couple of times when I was in my early teens, but being unable to get into it. I'm 21 now and have finally gotten around to seeing this cinematic masterpiece, and it has now assumed the top spot in my personal list of favorite films.

Everything about this movie is just so well done. The story is a modern epic. What's amazing is that I found myself literally on the edge of my seat for the entire three hours that this movie runs. Not once does it lag or draw out unnecessarily. Personally, I always feel that the longer a movie is the, the better, as it leaves more room for character and plot devolpment, but even in the best of the 170+ minute movies I've seen, there's always a few scenes that you feel could've been cut short or cut altogether. That never happens in The Godfather.

The characters, particularly Vito Corleone (Brando) and Michael Corleone (Pacino), are so dynamic and have such rich backgrounds; this is the key to a good story, IMO. The dialogue is classic, as you'll no doubt recognize many of the lines and expressions that have been incorporated into our modern vernacular.

There's so much more I wish to say about this movie, but I believe I'm running short on space. I'm a young man who doesn't always agree with critics and older audiences as to which films are truly classic. I've never been swayed to like a movie because others say it's great. So the fact that a 34-year old movie still has this kind of appeal to a younger audience is quite telling. I strongly encourage anyone of any age to see this movie. This is the pinnacle of American cinema."
10,The best,Watch this movie if you have eyes. Really good with acting and in depth meaning and good characters that you will love but will despise.
10,"Quite simply, the finest story ever put on film.","Watch any other film and tell me it is better... The only legitimate argument is the sequel. The story, the photography, the casting, an artistic statement of the first degree."
10,"Redefined, Acting, Cinematography, Production, Direction, Story telling and History (in a sense)","As well as previous works by Bergman, Wilder, Huston, Hitchcock, Speilberg, Lucas, Kubrick, Capra, Gibson and other greats that touch our souls as only a film of this nature could while sitting in a theatre. If you don't keep this film in your heart and recognize it as the true mold for all others that took the same path, referencing it's style, you would be mistaken. It is on a different level, as the NBA's Michael Jordan is to most other players that came before him or have followed....Look up the word Classic in the dictionary and you should see a synopsis of this body of work along with Citizen Kane and others....Coppala, Pacino, Brando and Puzzo have created the starting point for others.... and their predecesors, can stand up and take notice and include them as one of the classics of all time......bc"
10,Taking the Cannoli,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definite film."
10,"I'm a simple man, i see good movie, i press like !","Often advertised to me as the perfect movie, the best movie I'll ever see, and/or the be-all-end-all to movie-dom. It is a damn good movie. There's a reason Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan are household names. This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga. If it is too long (it is), a little slow in places (it is) and somewhat hard to follow in certain places (yep) we can forgive it, because they just don't make movies like this anymore. It isn't perfect, but it is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, and let yourself be carried along with the current of this slow-moving, but powerful, bit of culture."
7,Controversial af,Might just be me but it's overated. At the time i'm sure my grandad loved it but it just didn't do it for me. Go watch Goodfellas
10,A real masterpiece,"The acting and story telling is so powerful thanks to the teaming of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his novel). Marlon Brando is the Oscar-winning titled patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, who struggles to keep his family together. Oscar-nominated Al Pacino is the son Michael, who eventually takes his father's place. Let's not forget the supporting performances of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire. This is a really perfect movie about the mafia that does everything in their power to stay on top. Not to be missed, but if you can't say anything nice about ""The Godfather,"" then don't say anything at all. My evaluation: **** out of ****."
8,"A great film, though not as great as some will say.","The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history.

Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time.

The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs.

So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made.

8.5/10"
10,One of the greatest film made by far,"It's impossible not to like this movie. It's 'oldie, but goldie'. Such a good movie. And Marlon Brandon is one of the greatest actors ever. FF Coppola made a marvellous job in turning into a great movie the Mario Puzo's book. If you are a movie watcher, you have to see this. It'll mark you for life."
10,I was wrong,At first I didn't like the godfather but after forcing myself to sit through a rewatch gotta say not Half bad
9,Masterpiece,"I have seen this movie over 20 times now and i can say for sure this picture should never be touched and is what they should teach in college and universities for Art major and any one should at least see it one time ,it teaches you life experiences from 40 years ago that still applies to modern lifestyles."
7,During Roth's birthday party,"During Roth's birthday party, the pattern on his shirt changes. Due to weather difficulties, the two minute scene took over a week to shoot and the original shirt was lost at some point."
10,The best mafia movie,"The great cast and the spectacular acting made this movie one of the best in the history. It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. ""The Godfather"" is my favorite film of all time. It is absolutely legendary. This film, redefined the gangster genre. ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece. Everything about this movie is perfect. The performances are absolutely pristine. Marlon Brando gives the best performance of all time, in my opinion, as Don Vito Corleone. I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined."
10,Brilliant,"Such a classical film. A masterpiece great storyline wonderful acting it's as if you forget where you are and what's currently going on in life as you get last in this epic tale of the corleone family one of the best crime films I've ever watched , the entire cast did amazing and Marlon Brando was phenomenal James caan was convincing and Al Pacino was the icing on the cake . If you love a great film good visuals and an all star cast this is a film for you . Plot twist violence and betrayal one of the best movies of its era and to go beyond that one of the best movies ever made. The godfather a film you will find yourself watching more than once. Offically I'd rate 9.5 out of 10."
10,One of the best movie ever without a doubt.,"It's truly an experience to watch for the first time this movie. It's 3 hours long but still, I think I would still be captivated by the story even if it were 2 hours longer.

There's no break in the movie, and the necessary violence for a gangster movie is there, a lot!

Also, you can see the true talent of some actor. I think, without a doubt that it's the best Marlon Brando' movie ever. He's terrifying in that Godfather role and yet, you can see that he's a man that care entirely for his family and also that he's a man of conviction And we can those traits of character because Marlon Brando act it perfectly. Also, we can Al Pacino, but I still believe that he is better in the second Godfather.

To conclude, A truly masterpiece and I suggest everyone to see it once in their lifetime."
8,great english movie,"Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects."
9,2019-11-30,"Watched 2019-11-29.

An altogether enjoyable watch. The acting is quite exquisite, the story is captivating and there is no wonder as to why this movie is deemed one of the best classics of all time."
10,A masterpiece that will stand the test of time...,"It is no wonder why The Godfather is consistently ranked #1 by registered members of the Internet Movie Database. It is quite simply a great film in every respect. I won't rehash all the points that affirm why this picture is an undisputed classic that will be as relevant 50 years from now as it was in 1972.

The sequels, Godfather Part II and Part III, complete the story. Part II got the praise it deserved becoming the first and only sequel ever to win a Best Picture Academy Award. Unfortunately, Part III suffered from too much anticipatory hope that germinated from the 16 years between the two films. In other words, the film was held to a standard that would be impossible to achieve. It was masterfully told and with the same attention to detail given the earlier films, but a fair assessment was not to be given. Al Pacino's performance was outstanding, especially in the final scene with his reaction to death of Mary. It is a stunning and thoroughly heartbreaking expression of grief from a father who has lost a child. I wrote about Part III because many have dismissed it as a lesser film not up to par with the others, but this is criminally unfair.

One last comment about The Godfather films -- some have suggested that the films are too long. Well, that's just a stupid thing to say. It's like the King in Amadeus telling Mozart that his composition has ""too many notes"". Mozart asks, ""which notes would you cut""? The Godfather films are too complex to be shortened to accommodate those with a short attention span.

The DVD versions of the Godfather Trilogy are supposed to be released in Fall of 2001. I can't wait for all the extras. It'll be an offer we can't refuse."
10,Best Movie!,"Watched it yesterday and I was shocked how good that was!

The acting was 10/10 The plot was 9.5/10 The characters were 10/10 The cinematography was 10/10 The pacing was 10/10 The end was 9.7\10

The acting was so good that I almost believed that Marlon Brando was actually a mafia boss!

The plot is a little basic but they made it so good that that's an offer that I couldn't refuse to.

The characters were perfect for that movie (specially Don Vito and Michael) The cinematography was surprisingly amazing!

The pacing was absolutely incredible (loved that fact that everyone is wearing the same suit) The end was fantastic and perfect for such a great movie.

I think that it's the perfect movie to see at night alone.

Cant wait to see part 2 and 3!!"
10,The Best,"This should always be on top, The movie is classy stuff, Don Corleone is the best, And you will surely remember his quotes after the movie is over, Later on al pacino catches up in great pace I have seen all 3 part and i believe this is the best Of all. God Father "" I will make him a deal he cannot reject"" To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
10,"Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli","Without a doubt, it is the most cinematic triumph of its' kind...the narrative goes beyond the lens, it delivers an all star performance from the gritty dark family crimes of the early 40's ....... The performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro and others were superb. Let's not forget some of the best lines from any film that every Italian / Italo-American and Gangster lovers still to this day pronounce them with the garb and audacity to catch a laugh.... LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE CANNOLI... The Godfather, the ultimate Mafia Movie...."
10,Very favorable,"One of the greatest films made. I can watch it over and over and not tire. Great acting, story and screenplay - directing is top-notch! One of the few movies that sequel versions were as good if not better than the original. Especially since most of the key actors continued on through all three movies. That's commitment!"
9,Second Chance,"For years I've been hearing great things about this ""epic"" film, The Godfather. It's been aired on television numerous times, but I really didn't feel like sitting through a 5 hour run time (with added commercials). So I finally decided I should watch this film and get it over with, so through my local library I checked out The Godfather.

The film was very disappointing through the first watch, though the length of the film didn't bother me, I couldn't understand half of what Marlon Brando was saying. I was ready to rate The Godfather 5 stars when I came across a review from someone with similar feelings that said they watched the film again with subtitles. So I thought why not try to watch this disappointing film again with subtitles. What a difference!

The second watching with subtitles completely change my experience of The Godfather. I was able to understand the story a lot better and I'm glad I gave the film a second chance. It's 9 stars for me!"
10,Everything About This Is Perfect,"This movie is by far the best. I have not watched the sequel yet, but either way, I think we can't rank Part II as the best just because it's a sequel. But all acting is uniquely perfect. There were unbelievable twists and crazy violence for 1972, but I love it. There clearly is not a better movie out there."
9,Lives up to the hype,"It's not my personal #1 movie of all time, but after finally watching it I can understand why it's usually regarded as the greatest by so many. It can seem a little dated at times, but for a film that is over thirty years old it still stands up. Slow and deliberate, the movie shows that if you have an attention span of longer than 30 seconds you don't have to have action in every scene. Which is why when something does happen it is so shocking and unpredictable.

I was surprised at how little Brando was actually in the movie. I thought Pacino was much more impressive, but there's no denying Brando's presence on the screen.

My favorite quote: ""Leave the gun.....Take the cannolis."""
2,A Terrible overrated movie,"The fact this movie is consistently called the best movie of all time absolutely baffles me. This isn't even remotely one of my favorite movies, in fact its one of the worst I've seen. Its 3 hours long, which is far too long, it's beyond boring and the story, or what little story there is makes no sense. I did not understand why anything happened throughout the whole movie, each death just happened for seemingly no reason out of the blue. Some of the actors mumble so much they are impossible to understand or speak in Italian without subtitles, which doesn't help in following along with what's happening. This movie does not deserve the extreme high praise it has received, not by a long shot. Its single redeeming factor to me is the excellent cinematography for its time, I'll give it that."
8,Well made and well acted but ultimately slow paced and pretty boring.,"After seeing this movie numerous times I have to say that overall I find it highly overrated. It is definately well crafted and the acting is superb. However the pacing is dreadfully slow at times and while I think overall the acting is strong it does get a little overblown at times. Definately one of the best movies in its genre, unfortunately imho its not a genre with many good films."
10,awful,its a bad movie i don't know why you liked it i don't know whats am writing but its a good idea he how are you ? lets go out sometime why ? i like you good for you and you thank you yeah thank me and me no just me oh you are long lets see what can i say about this i really don't want to say anything why i don't know just wanna write a review cause am god at it no am not Ho's am kidding yeah am sorry and you should be i don't know why i say that a lot but its a good story and its a bad movie really bad i heat this movie and i heat you all i love myself and my mom dad yeah was a good times i agree with me and me just me yeah he is a bad person and a good movie no its bad really bad i heat it so much i love Friends and myself yeah Jahfali he is a good person
9,Worst piece of movie-making I've ever seen,"Basically I thought that this movie was a piece of crap. In no way does Marlon Brando portray a decent mafioso. I'd rather watch Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. Speaking of how horrible this movie was, Al Pacino is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. Everyone talks about how great he was in Scarface. I mean I have to give him credit, he did go on to become a superstar with great films such as: Any Given Sunday, The Merchant of Venice, (and let's not forget) The Recruit. Talk about an amazing movie, add Colin Farrell and Al Pacino together and you'll get something Jesus couldn't even come up with. I mean seriously, how many times did they shoot Don Corleone and he was still alive? I just don't buy that. As an aspiring actor, If I would have read the script for The Godfather (part one, two, or three) I would have laughed and wiped my browneye with it. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola for making a horrible movie. I recommend this movie to no one. If you are one of the millions who support this movie, I hope you burn for eternity. Check out Public Enemies if you want to see what a real Gangster movie is like."
10,Here is the Story of the Excelence!,"This is the story of outstanding portrait of organized crime. It has never happened to watch a film so exciting. What is exceptional about this movie is that I have watched it at least 10 times and I may watch it 100 times again and I am sure that I will be enjoying watching it like a first time. I believe strongly that, this movie has a special place for everyone. Godfather makes clear the distinctions between conflict of interests and the power of mafia.

I muscularly claim that, this movie is the best movie that ever made. Francis Ford Coppola made the novel of Mario Puzo become a masterpiece of art. The Corleone family is so perfectly portrayed that while watching the film you may think that you are a member of the family.

What about the characters of Godfather This is the fact that, we cannot see the heroes of this film in the street. I mean this is not the film that completely fit the life. The all characters of the movie are extraordinary. And therefore it is very hard to create these heroes behind the camera. That is why Marlon Brando (Don Vito Corleone), Al Pacino(Michael Corleone) or James Caan (Santino 'Sonny' Corleone) made their life job. In reality, goodhearted Don Vito Corleone has already become the symbol of the dark side of the underground. What is interesting is that, Don Vito for whom everyone feels admiration is the mixing of the bad and the good.

The details in this movie make itself very gripping which is the excellence of The Godfather. For example the way of speaking of Don Vito Corleone is really unforgettable. The performance of Marlon Brando really deserves a great appreciation.

What is also very interesting about this movie is that, this is the turning point of the drama & thriller in the movie history. Today, you can see several imitations of this movie.

All in all, from the director to the actors, this film certainly deserves to be best film that ever made. . I am talking for the ones who have watched this film only once. Go to watch this film at least 2 times again because the details might not be seen at first time."
10,One of the best movie,"One of the greatest movie i've ever seen if not the best. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando at their best. I can say that the first time i saw this movie, i taught it was the best experience of my life. The Godfather Part Two was equally as good as the first and The Godfather Part Three was good also but not quite at the first two. I heard many critics saying that The Part Three ruined the Trilogy but i don't agree, i liked it very much. I would give it 9.5 and 10 for the first two. The direction,picture, story, cast, acting all are perfect and that's why this film deserves the maximum grade. For all those who have not yet seen it, i strongly recommend to see it as soon as possible!"
10,Now ladies and gentleman it doesn't get any better than this.,"Long before serial killers, heroes, comedies, and dramas you had this masterpiece The, Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola knew just how to organize this so well by showing how a family made a living and going to elite power in the process. Marlon Brando is the greatest as Don Vito head of the family, then open the door for son Michael Corleone played perfect by Al Pacino. The, Godfather helped make Pacino a household name. The, Godfather also uses one of the best film editing techniques possible the work of Russian film editor Pudovkin as his editing technique of linkage of shots adds to the drama of The, Godfather. The scene of the baptism is linked just at the very same moment with the murder scene of enemies sure it is not the best pace but the scene is just perfect, and the drama of the events is increased through editing by linkage of shots by comparing death to a baptism both highly valued rituals in the mob. The, Godfather is the best from everything with the filming, acting, and the story. As you know The, Godfather will be the greatest classic forever."
6,"The Godfather: Iconic Yet Prolonged, Scores 6/10","The Godfather, often hailed as one of the greatest films in cinema history, earns a 6/10 from me. While the movie is undoubtedly well-crafted and features stellar performances, its lengthy runtime diminishes its appeal somewhat, particularly for viewers who prefer a more concise narrative.

The film's strengths are numerous: it offers profound insights into family and power dynamics, and the performances are exceptional, particularly Marlon Brando's iconic role as Vito Corleone. The storytelling is rich and complex, filled with memorable lines and scenes that have become a part of popular culture.

However, the extensive duration of the film can be a detractor. The slow pacing and intricate plot, while contributing to the depth and texture of the film, also make it a demanding watch. This length can be challenging for viewers who may struggle to maintain attention through slower scenes and a sprawling narrative that takes its time to unfold.

In conclusion, The Godfather is a classic that offers much in terms of character development and narrative depth. However, its extended length and slow pacing make it less accessible for some, reflected in the 6/10 rating. It's a film that demands patience and attention, rewarding those who appreciate detailed storytelling but potentially alienating those who prefer a quicker pace."
1,Boring,"Boring sooooo boring. It was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo extremely boring. I wanted to gouge my eyes out because it sucked so bad. I hope whoever made this movie slips and knocks some sense into himself that this movie could be used to torture people. The dude that plays the bad dude is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in my life. I hope that whoever was involved in this movie, meet up in one room and breathe so heavily while watching this movie that they lose all the auction in the room and it gets their head and they realize this movie is the worst movie to ever created and whoever created this movie and all the actors that worked on it again never again ."
10,Why I like The Godfather,"People always ask me this question why do you like ""The Godfather"". I always tell them, you have to see it to know it.

Vito Corleone the Godfathaer is fair, just. He smuggles gold but he won't deal in drugs and prostitution rackets because that's ""infamita"". He won't hesitate to kill a few Tattagilas because the world doesn't need them. He is angry with the establishment but that won't make him kill innocent people.

The Godfather stays true to Mario Puzo's book. The dialogues are the same as well.

What makes The Godfather special is that it's not a gangster film but a film about people who happen to be gangsters. At the end of the film you'd feel to take Coppola's hand and call him the Godfather."
10,The epitome of cinema,"The Godfather is placed near the top of any reliable best films list. It is an American classic based on Mario Puzo's novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It recounts the ascent of Michael Corleone to the head of his crime family, originally headed by his father, ""the Godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito is played by Marlon Brando in a key performance, which actually does not amount to all that much screen time (at least, relative to the whole film). The majority of the film focuses on Michael and his acquaintances trying to sustain an empire that satisfies their vision of an American dream.

The film exhibits masterful quality in virtually every category. The acting is one of those key aspects. Although I'm not a fan of Al Pacino, his performance as Michael is unarguably a great achievement. Marlon Brando is even more iconic and unforgettable as Don Vito. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are good supporting actors. In addition, I think Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain are wrongly unappreciated as bad guys.

The camera-work and direction is solid (although nothing groundbreaking). The music is fantastic. Although the main theme is most remembered, I believe the suspenseful music used to lead up to inevitable encounters is more important. It makes the tension come straight through the screen and into the audience.

The movie is a little on the long side, but most of the time the scenes are completely engrossing. It would be difficult for anyone to argue that The Godfather is not a great film. While its not my favorite movie of all time, it deserves its place in critic lists. It is as near perfect a movie as you can expect a human to make."
10,"Great Movie,Great Plot","Behind every great fortune there is a crime.

BALZAC

Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court Number 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonor her.

The judge, a formidably heavy-featured man, rolled up the sleeves of his black robe as if to physically chastise the two young men standing before the bench. His face was cold with majestic contempt. But there was something false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand.

""You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,"" the judge said harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animals.Animals. The two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed clean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their heads in submission.

The judge went on. ""You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor girl or I'd put you behind bars for twenty years."" The judge paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered slyly toward the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then lowered to a stack of probation reports before him. He frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke again.

""But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, and because the law in its majesty does not seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years' confinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.""

Only forty years of professional mourning kept the overwhelming frustration and hatred from showing on Amerigo Bonasera's face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the hospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these two animals went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they were all happy now, they were smiling now.

The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera's throat, overflowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was standing so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, confident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the fresh linen against his mouth.

The parents of the animals were coming by now, two men and two women his age but more American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, triumphant defiance.

Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward toward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, ""You will weep as I have wept--- I will make you weep as your children make me weep""--- the linen at his eyes now. The defense attorneys bringing up the rear swept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if to protect their parents. A huge bailiff moved quickly to block the row in which Bonasera stood. But it was not necessary.

All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in law and order. And he had prospered thereby. Now, though his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a gun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of his skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife and explained to her, ""They have made fools of us."" He paused and then made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. ""For justice we must go on our knees to Don Corleone."""
10,Simply The Greatest Film Ever Made!,"I love this movie! I will gladly be the first to admit, that I have always been fascinated by the Mafia, and that particular lifestyle... It's an incredible ride! It will deliver every genre of film you could possibly want: Action, Drama, Comedy, Suspense, and Romance... The performances in this movie by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale are simply the best acting you will ever see... I've always said if I can't believe the actors in their roles, then I will not recommend the movie to someone, In The Godfather, Everyone performs their roles... Perfectly! I know this is a long movie, but trust me, I have seen it so many times, and it is the only movie that I've ever seen to keep my attention the entire running time.

I am a huge movie person, and I will also admit I'm still pretty young, but what I do know is The Godfather tops my list as my all time favorite movie! I've cried several times at the expanse of the Corleone Family! I wish I could truly sum up how emotionally gripping this movie is, but I just can't, I could try all day, but I would keep saying oh I'm missing this, or I'm missing that... I am also reminded of what Marlon Brando said, and I apply this to my life everyday... ""A Man Who Doesn't Spend Time With His Family Can Never Truly Be A Real Man!"""
10,The only Film without a mistake.,"Undoubtedly the best picture of all times and perhaps the only movie without a plot hole in the history of film making. Not a single scene or a line is unnecessary in the whole film. The direction, casting, plot, music, cinematography, acting, lines, everything seems just perfect. Al Paccino and Brando simply were born for their roles. But please don't bother to watch this epic film if you do like movies with extreme violence, sense less killing, unnecessary car chases and the hero fighting ten people at a time with bare hands. This film is totally in a different league, you simply cannot compare it to any other crime or gangster movie ever made. The way Al Paccino transformed himself from a subtle, educated and sophisticated Italian American into a typical Italian mafia boss, is without a doubt one of the best performances of all times."
10,A Masterpiece!!! Truly a masterpiece!!,"The Godfather is by far one of the greatest films of all time. Since I haven't been on IMDb for over 3 months I got to see quite a lot of great films over the summer. The Godfather has to be the best movie I saw over the summer. Marlon Brando, to my eyes delivered the best character in a movie ever. Wow, such a great film. I started growing into Mafia movies more and now I'm obsessed with it. This is my 5th favorite movie of all time. The screenplay, acting, cinematography, dialouge, and directing were superb!! You have to see this amazing film!! Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and everyone else did marvelous. Thank god they made this movie.

10/10"
10,The Godfather perfectly encapsulates the essence of cinema,"I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.

But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.

I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films.

And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It's atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola's style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it's very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one's realization, he or she will realize it is not those things.

I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren't obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we're watching it from a completely different angle. And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else's certainty that is the best movie ever. It's okay if you still don't like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don't see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it."
10,Masterpiece,"The film masterpiece of the century . Set in the old New York , is a mix of where the center of it all is the Sicilian Mafia . Or rather , of Sicilian origin . The figure most stereotypical Italian of that time , becomes the protagonist in The Godfather . Movies with a few smudges , shot in close contact with Mario Puzo , author of the book , and after all inspired by a story that seems real . But the extraordinary nature of the film lies in the cast , the consecration of Marlon Brando , and the "" launch "" of artists like Al Pacino , Robert De Niro and again , Robert Duvall . In short , the good old Francis saw us right . The film legend. The same Italian dubbing is impeccable in almost all his version even if in the heart , keep the dubbing of Amendola to the voice of Michael Corleone . You could add so much , but given the affection I feel for the film but would only idolatry same . Excellent and for me it's a pain to see it - here on IMDb - only "" second"" for users . But 100 of Metascore suggests much ... Kiss the hands !

PS: English could be not very well."
6,If you like gang type of films..,"Then you probably will love it :) I'm not a fan, not my type of movie."
2,Boring drivel,"Simply put, this is a very poor movie. The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time). Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds. The closest explanation I've gotten from anyone I've talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because ""it's the Godfather.""

A movie that puts you to sleep and is not exciting or interesting does not belong as the greatest movie of all time to me."
10,I think that Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made,"I think that Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made. Along side Enemy at the gates, The good The bad and The ugly, Popillon,The Message  is one of the outstanding movies, but I can say that godfather 1 is the best. It is my opinion that there are more than 10 sequences in this fabulous movie that we can rate them as the best sequences in history of cinema.

I think that story is fantastic; Marlon Brando is incredible, and all the actors and actresses are great. The ending is dramatic and music is also one of the best one. I often see the top sequences for 1 to 60 minutes. I really congratulate to Francis Ford Coppola for this excellent movie. YOU TAPE YOUR NAME IN HISTORY DEAR FRANCIS."
10,Definitely one of the finest movies ever made,"Francis Ford Coppola has done some brilliant work, but he has never been better than in The Godfather and the sequel. This is a complex story set in New York City in the era just after World War II. It involves the Corleone Family, an Italian-American family that has thrived in the U.S. as the father of the clan (Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando) turned to organized crime to gain his slice of the American Pie. I won't get into the plot too much for fear of invoking the ""spoiler"" rule, but the essential plot revolves around a dispute between the Corleone Family and one of the other crime families over Corleone's unwillingness to engage in the illegal drug trade.

Although the movie is strictly Hollywood fantasy in its treatment of the American Mafia (it is NOT this glamorous), the Godfather does play on some real life plot twists in the history of the mafia. For example, Carlo Gambino, the head of the most powerful of New York's Five Families for decades, did in fact have a strong moral and practical opposition to the drug trade which led to his famous edict of ""deal and die"" for those under his command.

The plot is a modern version of a Shakespaerean or Greek tragedy as the family patriarch(s) rationalize their actions in the name of protecting the family. It's a classic plot line that has been around for centuries, but it has never been better than in the Godfather. The direction is fantastic and the acting is unreal. Brando as the father is flawless, and Al Pacino and James Caan are brilliant as the sons. Also, the supporting cast is also first rate. Look for great supporting roles from Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Sterling Hayden and a host of other talented actors.

Anyone who doesn't love this movie is either lying or just trying to cause trouble. 10 out 10 for sure."
9,A mob of fun,"The Godfather is one of the best films ever to be made; it has everything that makes a movie worth watching. One of the great aspects of this film is the fact that it is watchable over and over again. The story line is good, no excuse me great, all of the actors from the awesome Marlon Brando, to the underrated Talia Shire turn in superb performances. The story centers on Don Vito Carleone (Brando) and his family. James cann turns in a standout performance as Sonny. Diane Keaton's role is small but she plays the character of Kay perfect. The Godfather has one of the most gripping storylines that has come across in any film. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking. While there is no such thing as a perfect film, because someone will always find something they don't like in a movie, The Godfather is a film with few flaws. There is action, some comedy, a little romance, and tons of drama. The Godfather is about one family and how they will and do kill for each other. It's a movie that at the center is about what we all do to survive in this world. At most it's a film that will make its viewer escape their everyday reality and step into a wild that hopefully most of us haven't become accustomed to. 3.9 out of 4 stars. (A)"
8,"Good, but this is not what mob life is like","I know because I knew a mob guy. This is Hollywood's glorification of the worst possible life to choose. Phenomenal acting, but the life of a mob guy is violent and depraved (and often broke). The most realistic mob movie I have ever seen is Donnie Brasco. This is what mob life is really like. Mob life is about a million miles from being romantic. Carlito's Way is another realistic (more or less) look at street crime life. you watch this movie for the phenomenal acting, not for realism in any way. Hollywood loves to capitalize off stories of gangsters, glorify it up a bit, and package it as if it were real. What's real is busting your hump, not making enough in a month so you have to sell dope, and wondering if there is a gun at your head every second of the day. to be honest, I'd rather sell staplers."
10,"For me, The Godfather isn't the greatest film ever, but still one of the best","I can't say much that hasn't already been said a hundred times; this is a flawless masterpiece of cinema. It is considered the greatest movie ever made (and although it is not my favourite) it is rightly considered so because I can't pick out any faults in this movie. Everything from the acting (with a cast like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and so on) you cannot go wrong! Nino Rota's score is fantastic and superbly integrated into the film. Marlon Brando gives a powerhouse performance of a lifetime as the now infamous Don Vito Corleone and the music is now referred to as the quintessential mafia music.

Not much needs to be explained about the plot as I'm sure almost everyone knows about it. It centers around the Corleone family and their rise through the world of crime. The family consists of Don Vito (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale).

I could rave on for ages about why this film is so good but I don't think I need to. The actors capture their roles perfectly and give them depth and emotion. Francis Ford Coppola's directing couldn't have been better, he captures the mood of the 40's and the underground crime world perfectly. He creates an epic, soap-operish feel of a families rise to power through corruption and murder. Nothing at all looks cheap or hokey, the special effects are nasty and the cinematography is beautiful.

Basically, this movie is recommended to any person who considers them-self a movie buff (although any self-proclaimed movie connoisseur has to have seen this) or someone who just wants a cinematic gem!

5/5"
6,Best movie ever? Not even close,"People say this movie is one or even the best movie of all time I can't really understand why. I did not go in for very high expectations so I thought that after I had watched this movie my mind would be blown but it wasn't and thats really sad. This movie was really original but it doesn't and it helps this movie a lot still this movie is very overrated. I have not read the book. This movie compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy is I'm sorry to say it but a joke. It's not really worth watching it feels like what was the purpose of this movie? To see the underworld? The last 15 minutes are the best thing in this movie but you really got to ask yourself is it worth watching a movie that is 175 minutes long for 15 minutes? The actors was outstanding but so are the ones in as an example The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception or Lord of The Rings Trilogy. When I was going to see Looper I came in with the same expectations but but my mind was blewn! Looper had a purpose but The Godfather didn't. Sorry to all of you who think that your going to see the best movie ever but this is not the one, go see Lord of The Rings Trilogy there you have a masterpiece!"
3,Overated,"If you want to see the quintessential american crime film? Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison. Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather. It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the ""earners"" on the street. He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride. He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale.

Scorcese created goodfellas with passion and respect. The line between good and evil was blurred, as it is in real life. The good stories of the mafia dont come from the ""Don"". They come from the ""earners"". The guys in the trenches. They are what keeps the wheel turning."
10,An Excellent Work of Movie-making by Copolla,"Some spoilers ahead.

If you rent the ""Godfather"" DVD and listen to Copolla's comments about the production of the movie, it seems, from his view, that this film was plagued from the start with needling from Paramount studios. He was supposed to film ""The Godfather"" on the cheap with limited resources and constant input from the studio as to what he could do. He was regarded as such a bad director that he was almost fired from the task. His photo director (somebody with more knowledge of movie-making can correct me) thought Copolla didn't know what he was doing with what he thought were odd camera angles. It is the greatest irony of all that this movie became a timeless classic and propelled not only the fortunes of Paramount Studios in 1972, but launched the careers of Copolla as a director, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton as actors, and revived the once-glorious but then-moribund career of Marlon Brando (as you all know, he would later enter a second period of professional and personal decadence).

Copolla was blessed with some of the best actors possible for this movie. Al Pacino was great as the mostly-taciturn but wily and cunning Michael Corleone, the true protagonist of the ""Godfather"" saga. I personally thought he, rather than Brando, should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Michael Caan gives his all as the bombastic and violent Sonny, Michael's older brother. Diane Keaton's performance has been called relatively weak, but I think this is not a fair assessment. She is very good as the naive and rather innocent girlfriend of Michael. Despite cries of nepotism in the casting decision, Talia Shire, Copolla's sister, does well as the battered and frantic sister of the Corleone clan. Robert Duvall is absolutely excellent as the ""brains"" of the Corleone family, Tom Hagen. Of course, Brando's performance is what will be most remembered of this movie, even though he is not on the screen as much as Pacino or Caan. He chose to be creative as the mumbling, aged, and rather stoic leader of the mob family. He is seldom over-the-top, which one may see as a relief to the stock character of the angry, vengeful gangster (Caan fulfills that role to the nines).

Of course, overlooked are the performances of the secondary characters (whose names fail me, precisely because they never achieved fame and fortune on the scale of Pacino, Brando, Duvall, Keaton, or Caan). The guy who played ""The Turk"" Solozzo is a wonderful actor, and convincingly plays the character of the slimy drug-dealing antagonist. Sterling Hayden, who portrayed the loony ""Jack D. Ripper"" in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" also is quite good in his brief role as the evil police captain. I honestly can't be a fair judge of the characters of Fredo Corleone or the infamous henchman, Luca Brazi, as their time on the screen was rather brief. Still, for what it's worth, they did the best they could with what little screen time they had (John Cazale's Fedo would play a much more significant role in the ""Godfather"" sequel).

The movie does have its fair amount of stylistic or memorable violence, but the screen in not chock full of nonstop guts and gore. Copolla's creativity as a director, and his use of stylistic devices, such as the frequent use of running children, dark, gloomy backgrounds, and music juxtaposed with violent images, makes this a highly entertaining movie. The characters are actually deep and make an impression on the viewer. This story is not Marlon's, but rather Pacino's, as we see his character grapple with his decision to join his family's criminal empire after his father is gunned down. We see him, based on his not-so-reluctant decision to murder the man responsible for shooting his father, Solozzo, slowly and credibly evolve from war hero who is not a member of the rackets, to being the ruthless head of the criminal empire. Copolla and Pacino keep us engaged in the story the whole time, with very few abrupt halts in the in the flow of the story.

In short, this is the little film that, in spite of the huge problems it faced, payed off big in terms of box office receipts and critical acclaim. No movie buff should miss this masterpiece; average joes will love it too. Highly recommended."
10,It's The Little Things...,"The Godfather casts a long shadow over every single film represented on IMDb, to a point that creates impossible expectations, and frequent accusations of ""overrated"". Let that very subjective criteria be measured against IMDb's very transparent ranking logic: average popularity. Much like the Oscars, the IMDb top 100 might not be ruled by your number 1 film, but by the film the greatest number of people ranked very highly. If you free The Godfather from this weighty title, it still deserves a 10 by any standard.

Let's rewind, and consider the insanity it took, back in 1971, to even contemplate giving a relatively novice director free reign to adapt a vast crime saga, in a costly period setting, and starring an ""ethnic"" nobody and a faded has-been. The Godfather is first and foremost a triumph of screen writing, Coppola's original forte, but the fine structure, character moments and dialogue could have been tarnished by a by-the- numbers treatment, and this where the film leaps from good to great.

What makes The Godfather one of the finest films ever made is how right all the individual pieces are, and how well they work in unison: the performances, all of them rich and credible, from Pacino's star-making turn to Brando's classic creation; the world of the story, rich and murky, in perfect service of the story; the look, courtesy of groundbreaking work from ace cinematographer Gordon Willis... But dig deeper and it's the small touches Coppola meticulously peppered his film with that make it unforgettable, be it a touching death in an orange grove, or hit men debating the perfect gnocchi recipe.

Ultimately, its rewards are double what you'd expect, because, by most accounts (though I still prefer this one), Part II is even better.

Unmissable!"
10,Wow,"All right! Let me start by admitting that I should have watched this a long ago instead of waiting until now. Just never got around to it. The Godfather is probably one of those few films that everyone that has ever watched a film has at least heard about. The story of the aged leader of a mob family that transfers his powers to his son intermixed with the lives of the family members and their actions.

Used as an example for a plethora of films that were to follow it, used as a starting point for games. It's been used for everything, but nothing and no one ever came close to touching this film. It's a work of art - a truly and completely compelling story worked into a great looking film with strong playing actors, making for a film that constantly breathes what is trying to depict: life with the mob.

For the rest I have nothing to add. A true masterpiece that is yet to be outclassed. A true ground breaking film that sets standards for all others.

10 out of 10 Italian accents"
10,"Pacino, Brando and Coppola rocks!","I know how annoying it is with long comments so: GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE! It´s the best movie ever made and nobody can make a better one! The actors are completely wonderful and Coppola has created a masterpiece! The sequels are great, but this one is the best part of the trilogy! Some people may find the movie slow, but can they say that the story is bulls**t? Not likely... 10/10!!!!!"
10,Excellent film...not number 1 though...,"This movie is said to be the number one movie of all time on here, IMDb's top 250 movies of all time.

I disagree. In my humble opinion that spot is reserved for Citizen Kain, Casablanca, or perhaps even Akira Kurosawa's classic, The Seven Samurai.

With that said, this movie is an excellent film. This movie shows us the intricacies of the mafia. Instead of being a film about the mafia concerned with killing and drug dealing and such, we see the family waiting for the next hit or planning a deal or whatever it may be. It is a movie about family and what happens on the inside of the mafia.

The film draws you in and makes you feel as if you are part of the family. Al Pacino is incredible and his character arc is done so well, I don't know if anyone else could have pulled it off. Marlon Brando is great as Don Vito Corleone.

This is an amazing film. I give it a 10 out of 10. A must see. But again, I don't agree that it is the number one film of all time. Everyone has their opinion though."
10,The Word Classic May Be a Cliché....,"There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. The acting is superb. The story all consuming. You wonder, will you ever be able to watch another film without using The Godfather as a bench-mark. You won't be able to help yourself.

I hadn't seen the trilogy until recently. I have now watched it twice in the space of a month. The whole film is gripping. I hated characters, loved others, and felt the very conflict the whole film was about. You wonder what you would do. You search your soul. No one should die without seeing this film."
7,Not bad,He is a good movie . But i dont see any reason why he is the first movie on imdb . He is good but not a legendary movie. Actually i think that peaky blinders is the best gangsters serie till now and i dont think that godfather is better than peaky . Marlon brandos acting is fine . But not as fine as cillian murphy . After all this is my personal opinion.
1,I did not care for The Godfather!,"Did not care for The Godfather. Didn't like it! Everyone always says ""It's so good. It's like the perfect movie."" Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, all fine, fine actors, did not like the movie. Why? I couldn't get into it. It insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in, you spend like six and a half hours, I can't even get through it. I can't even finish the movie. I've never even seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs. I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different language. That's where I lose interest and I go away. I love The Money Pit with the guy from Big. Funny guy, Tom Hanks, everything he says is a stitch!"
10,Classic Great Movie.,"Highly recommend movie. A lot of action throughout the movie with a lot of it.To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. mafia and family life is superb in every department, writing, acting, directing, a highlight of Coppola's career as well as of New American Cinema.Vizzini was right: Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime.Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece."
10,This is a movie you can't refuse.,"If anybody can point out any flaws in The Godfather, I'd like to see them do it. Watching this movie makes me want to join the mob. If somebody ever names me Godfather to their child, I'll be too tempted to give them a horse's head. Vito Andolini Corleone, his sons MIcheal, Santino,and Fredo, his friends Sal and Peter. What a collection of hooligans. This isn't a great movie.It's a perfect movie."
10,The Best movie ever,"This movie change everything, it has great actors and good screenplay is the best movie ever. If you still don't see it you must to. But the only thing I found is this movie is for men more than women. Is a little violent so I think is why many women doesn't like it like men. I would like to tell that this movie is based in a book named The Good Father and the book is so much interested and the story is longer and complex that shows in the movie, still the movie is the best movie you can see. So I recommended to watch it is you still don't do it. And the soundtrack is the best Coppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including the main theme, ""Speak Softly Love""."
10,The Greatest Movie Ever,"Wow, amazingly beautiful story that attract you to watch it all, even the smallest details are amazing, I think its become the icon for all movies till now. Al Pacino has that perfect act and I'm sure he will always be remembered by this name (Michael Corleone) also Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro (The Godfather II) will always by remembered as (Don Vito Corleone), all of them played the (Godfather) perfectly. Beautiful pictures, locations and the soundtrack that touch your feeling and you will never forget it. Thank you Francis Ford Coppola for this contribution that made the tragedy and drama movies worth to be watched, thank you Mario Puzo for this amazing story, thank you Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and all the cast for sharing your acting talent."
10,A Classical Masterpiece,"The Godfather(1972): A review One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather is one of those rare movies that get everything right, transcending limitations and setting new benchmarks. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay structured by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an American crime film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of a fictional New York crime family of Italian descent. The story primarily is centered on Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) and his transformation from a family outsider to the apparent heir to the title that is The Godfather, initially held by Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando).

The beauty of the screenplay is not in its simplicity, but in subtlety. The Godfather, is that the story is played out entirely in a closed world. The audience is sucked into admiring the characters that are essentially evil. The movie portrays the Mafia, from the inside; its structure, its functioning, its virtues and imperfections included.

Now coming to the performances of the lead actors - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino.

Vito Corleone, as the Godfather, is the moral centre of the movie. He understands that liquor, gambling and even women are crimes that the world has a place for, but drugs is a strict NO. Marlon Brando, plays one of his more memorable characters in the suppressed, authoritative Sicilian.

Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, is brilliant. As the story progresses forward, we see Michael move from a soldier in love and one who undermined his family business, to the loving son who sought to protect his family, and eventually turned into the one thing he never wanted to become.

In the end, an articulately brilliant movie that captivated the audience from the start and does not let them drift, due its brilliant screenplay and acting. No wonder then that it features as one of the best movies in cinematic history."
10,Why this movie will CHANGE your life!,"Have you ever questioned yourself as to why we are here?

The answer is simple, watch this movie to find out exactly what I mean.

Family, honor, respect, loyalty, and most important of all FAITH! A man needs these basic and crucial aspects in his life. How can a building stand without a base, how can a car run without any gas? Everything has an action and reaction in life. You can let things go by or you can approach everything with confidence and reassurance from your base. A mans' family is his base, his love is infrastructure, and his faith is his concrete overlay. A man has three great possessions in life, those being love, family,and faith. Once he acquires that he will then begin to realize those loyal to him also respect him. This movie taught me fear isn't as good as respect. When people fear you; it'll only take one person to not be afraid and stand up to you to cause you to lose it all. Meanwhile respect held at such a higher platform could never be taken away. Knowledge is power, power gains respect and respect gets you paid.

In conclusion this movie will definitely change the way you hold your values in life. Some for good, others for worse.

Without all three of those it would be impossible for anyone to survive. Greatest movie of all times in my opinion!

1,Awful,"This movie is like football, people only watch it because the think its 'cool' or 'popular', but really it is the most dreary repetitive and slow film i have had the displeasure in viewing.

How this film grew to be such a ''great'' i do not know, bu ti know that it shouldn't be, Shawshank Redemption may not deserve to be second best film ever, but at least it is worthy of being where it is and is certainly a better film than any of the Godfathers.

So please consider this when voting, the Godfather is poorly directed, badly scripted, crudely acted and most importantly is, quite frankly boring and wearisome."
10,Best film Ever Made in History of Film Making,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. its basically the story of the old generation of the mob being taking over by the new younger generation. great performances are done by all . the story telling is pretty well done all be it there are some slow downs where things seem they drag on a bit to long and gets a little dull. for the most part though its a entertaining story that will be watched for years to come .It's such amazingly well-acted, well- written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece."
10,Great movies...great times...,"Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs. A couple notable titles were ""The Lord of the Rings"" (actually a series) and ""The Godfather."" Both are excellent movies that are deserving of the top spots in ""best movies ever made."" However, I was extremely excited when I was waiting for this film.

Everything about ""The Godfather"" is not like any other film period - the story is strong, the film-making is excellent, the directing is spectacular - and at first, I thought the film was going to be three hours long! (The last ""Lord of the Rings"" movie clocks in, for the original version, at 3 hours 20 minutes!) This movie is, in fact, about 20 minutes shorter, which was a relief after finishing the ""Lord of the Rings"" series.

And yes, I can easily see why this movie got the top spot in IMDb's ""250 Best Movies Ever Made"" list. After seeing this, I started looking at bad movies like crazy just so that I could say ""Been there, done that!"" Hey, I love my movies! ""The Godfather"" is a highly recommended movie. No one should enjoy their movies without this title!"
10,One perfect movie.....Will Never leave Number 1!!!!,"After seeing this film you will be speechless....god...it's great....one of the best movies all time, EVER!!!!

10/10 all the way, for '72 the quality of the video is magnificent. Godfather part 2 isn't as good, but after seeing this film how could it have been?

So realistic in the perfect mobster atmosphere.

Sadly the series is over, but oh well...............

10/10...5/5...PERFECT...

The Shawshank Redemption was good...and so was LOTR 3...but they will never compare to this Classic!!! The best series....the best movie.....everything in this film is great...just perfect...

I LOVED IT...AND STILL DO..."
10,"A masterpiece, from the master, Francis Ford Coppolla","Easily Marlon Brando's best performance. James Caan's best performance, and Al Pacino steals the show. Al Pacino's performance is not as good as the one from Dog Day Afternoon, but still up there as his second best performance. Arguably Robert Duval's best performance ever. Off course we must mention Al Pacino's dear friend (also from Dog Day Afternoon), who plays his older brother Fredo, John Cazale; an amazing performance, that he will top in Godfather II. I also need to mention that Johnny Fontane, played by Al Martino, is most likely based on, or at least inspired by, Frank Sinatra... And we need to mention the iconic music, the only score that ever came close to Ennio Moricone's music. In fact the maestro, Ennio Morricone, performed that tune more then once. Some people call this movie the bible... That might be a bit cynical, but it simply is the most quoted movie ever. ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."""
10,The movie to conquer all movies,"Movies are made for a lot of reasons and can inflict human emotions to the audience. Some tend to be classics because a lot of people enjoyed the movie and raved about it. Others don't go far to be known. In my opinion, movies that are classics are going to stay for a long time. Movies that don't fare well will be forgotten. But, what about movies like The Godfather? Is that movie is going to be around for a long time? Absolutely. Is it for all generations to see? Absolutely. Without a doubt, The Godfather is the leader to all of the great movies. The movie is adapted from Mario Puzo's best-seller and it tells the story of a family. Vito Corleone is the head of his family. He is also the head of the family's business. His family deals with different situations that are dealt with in their own style and fashion. In other words, they are the Mafia. When Vito's son comes home from the war, he decides on his own behalf to not get involved in his family's business. Michael Corleone, Vito's son, decides to live his own life while his family deals with their own problems. But, when one of Vito's sons, Sonny, played by James Caan, is killed during a mob hit, Vito decides to take revenge against the people who killed his son. Meanwhile, Michael becomes aware of his surroundings and starts to see a downfall of his father's empire. His father is severely injured in the streets after being gunned down and Michael starts to wonder who's going to watch over the family. In other words, who's going to be the next godfather? As the movie progresses, I was suddenly starting to see a change being done to the movie and also to the movie industry. This rise and fall story is told very beautifully and is directed with a focused look at a world where family sticks together and carry out their jobs and fall down and suffer the consequences. This movie has a lot in store and has a lot of feeling about the underworld of the mafia. We even see that even though Michael does become who he is in the end, we know that for a fact that the choice was one that couldn't be refused. The Godfather is a film to be hailed. It's portrayal of the Italian mob is not stereotypical. Instead, the movie focuses on a family that is doused with honor, pride, lust and life. People do get hurt in these drastic situations and those wounds do hurt in a way that you've never felt before. For me, this film speaks louder than the words that are being said. It is more than a gangster movie. It is what the movies are meant to do, which is entertain us at its best and greatest. The performances by Marlon Brando is excellent. He really leads a very well-casted movie that include Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall, as the family lawyer, who is Irish and the supporting role of Diana Keaton as Pacino's love interest. All of the acting in The Godfather is phenomenal. This is the movie that made Al Pacino a star. He is that great of a legendary actor to star as Michael. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that in several interviews involving his film, he said that The Godfather was the hardest film to make. With a ballooning budget and a casting problem with the role of Vito Corleone, Coppola suffered most of the time and even was afraid he'll lose his job. In my opinion, he should be proud of the film he made. Even though it was troubling to make, in the end, it paid off. Not only being in the top 10 grossing films of 1972, but also allowing us to see a movie that's worth watching and worth looking at. It is also fill with style and power that in the end, we are starving to see it again. The Godfather took home 3 Oscars, including Best Picture and spawned 2 sequels. As a movie buff, all I can say is that The Godfather leads behind other classic movies like Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca. Like those 3 other movies, it's the power and story-telling that grabs us out of the movie theater and puts us into the spotlight with well-scripted characters and various stories that emerged out of the family. The sheer critical praise of The Godfather continues to seen and even though it's been 41 years since the film's release, this film isn't going to die. The epic scope and vision of this underworld is going to live on and keep this classic pumping. The Godfather is the best film of 1972 and yet, one of the greatest movies of all time. ★★★★ 4 stars."
10,Why is this movie so highly regarded?,"It's ability to transcend the test of time, and it's perfect cinematic portrayal of an infamous subculture are what make this movie so highly regarded. The movie was so captivating and did such a good job of identifying the Italian American Organized Crime Sub-Culture that it actually became the handbook by which future generations of mobsters operated. I can't think of many movies that have had that kind of cultural impact. Brilliant production from start to finish! The show was cast perfectly helping to solidify it as a classic. Even today the movie is relevant and has provided a basis and format for movies about organized crime. Intensity of the scenes was key to the accurate portrayal of the life of a crime family."
10,A classic all the way,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and the acting performances of Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny match that comment (Al Pacino is also good, but they have the edge). The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike's evolution into a Mafia chief.

The movie adds to the mystique of Brando as Godfather by not having him the center of action except for the first third of the movie, keeping you from that overdone feeling, and his major decisions are made in the wedding and shortly thereafter. But oh, the classic scenes that resulted: the friendship scene with Bonasera, the ""making an offer that he can't refuse"" line, the horse's head, the hand stabbing/strangling death of Luca Brasi. In the minority situation for an actor's being made to look older than he is, Brando is superb. The cotton stuffing in his mouth works magnificently. He is The Godfather all the way -- way, way over Michael. His wisdom and counsel are greater, and his majesty; Michael is a morose figure.

Sonny is a formidable, memorable character (is he not much taller than James Caan is?), and his blatant id contrasts with Vito and Michael. Tom Hagen is also played very well, by Robert Duvall, and other actors and actresses do a good job. The hypocrisy crystallized by the Catholic mass setting is also excellent. And hey, is not Sonny beating up his brother in law one of the very, very best fight scenes, even if one-sided? What can I cite by comparison, Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris in The Way of the Dragon -- and yes, not sarcastically -- for what good fight scenes are so distinctive, intense and original, leaving such an imprint--what other very good fight scene also sticks out so much in one's mind over others? You can't say, ""they're all the same"" for this one. Sonny, like Vito and Mike, is part of American popular culture (well, I guess international, not to be chauvinistic).

One of my friends, and perhaps yours, has said, ""I was rooting for the Corleones."" As one who likes many thrillers, action and suspense movies, and crime dramas, but does not like the overly depressing subject matter and sleazy characters and sometimes tortuous, overcomplicated plots that characterize the mid-70s onward (Pulp Fiction, Grifters, etc.), I note that this is unfortunately a forerunner of these, altho not hard to follow. But I think it was the Godfather Part II that really was the precursor, and II's quality pales in comparison to I's (I do not care what others think), and much more than other sequels. Because the genius of The Godfather I was taking such sordid subject matter and making it so entertaining, so much a part of our consciousness, and leaving us with such positive feeling when we think about it. I do not believe this is the case for many later movies to which its influence can be traced."
6,The single most overrated film in the history of Cinema.,"My problem with The Godfather is singular. I feel absolutely nothing the entire movie. I feel no emotional connection to the characters. I feel no emotional connection to the story. Of all the gangster movies this trilogy is far behind many of the modern classics. Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed are all much better movies. They have a wow factor to them. The Godfather tries incredibly hard to get you to car about these mob families, but I just don't. I've always thought this was a mediocre trilogy. A move should make you feel something and everytime I've sat down to watch the Godfather the only feeling I get is boredom. It is not a 9.2..."
10,One of the greatest of all time,Simply amazing. This is probably the only 3 hour movie I would ever watch
10,It's The Best!,"This movie is something else. It's like you are watching the best movie ever made. It's realy enjoyable and its very fun. If i need to explain this movie with one Word, it would be amazing. Anyways. I saw this movie at 17 years old. And i was amazed how good the movie was. And my mouth hust dropped open at the end of the masterpuice. You really should watch this movie. And the other two movies. To sum up, if you have the time and if you are into criminal movies this is the one. This isa masterpice and this is te perfwct movie. Neverthless i loved the caracter Don andMichael a lot! So watc this movie."
10,An unique and breakthrough film,"The title says it all, I saw it by the first time four months ago and then I couldn't help seeing the whole trilogy. The characters are bold and well personified by the Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and others of a cast that was never assembled again.

Then other movies came along in the Mob-Crime genre. I felt immersed in this world or may I say underworld and took the ride till the very end.

Incredible it is to say that to watch this now it gave me the sensation that was an actual film, the reason it is that this working piece it is an a unique coalition of talents that will revive this film again and again for any generation that watches it.

I recommended it!"
10,A true classic,"This movie shines, it's brilliant, it's...beautiful!"
10,The Godfather movie.,"The Godfather is one of the best movie of all times, with it's style, structure, and playing characters it definitely leaves a mark in a memory.

The movie brings us to the times, where New York City was so criminal, and Italian Mafias were spreading across that region.

It is the superb movie, to watch if you would like to learn a lot about Italian culture, and how the Godfather - Don Carleone took care of his business, money, people, and criminal world, and who had, a good heart, at the end of the day. The scenes take place in both Italy and Little Italy, New York City, USA!

Thanks."
10,Greatness,"Yes, it is perfect. Every praise you hear about it is true. When every aspect of making a film is top-notch, you get the absolute movie. I would like to note though, Godfather is NOT a movie to watch while eating your pizza. It needs you to be completely devoted to it."
7,just read that,"So i just voted the Godfather 7/10. But when I had to summarize it in that one line, i just couldn't do it. It's impossible. The movie has been so tainted and vandalized in the industry that it seems that it's impossible for one to point a finger on just exactly how they feel.

Simply put: the Godfather is a good, solid, 3 star (out of four) movie. Yes, the experienced may have been ruined for me (i first saw it with a cold and didn't like it, so i had to see it later, as i knew something was wrong). I also may be too young (all the commenters say you have to be over 18. i say you could see the movie at ten and over). But i feel the movie is a well written, well acted, well balanced movie.

What's the problem? Again, I'm speechless. It lacks a kick, that special kick that so many movies need to have. Unlike its outstanding sequel, it fails to generate the feeling that the viewer is wrapped in it like a blanket, with the exception of a few scenes. it best serves as an introduction to a legendary trilogy, rather than just a movie.

Brando shines as a role that seems written for him, Pacino is great, Caan is head to head with his performance here and with his performance in the gripping Misery (3 1/2 stars out of four). The script has some of the most realistic writing ever written. It simply lacks the kick.

If a person walked up to me and asked if they should see it, i would probably slap them in the face, ask what's wrong with them, and steal their lunch money. But I would also tell them that before they see it, they should be ready to form their own opinion. Now we come to the ""how it was ruined"" part.

Hollywood generated and ego for this movie. if you don't like it, or even have a positive opinion like me, you're automatically not considered a movie buff. I applaud (and send my heart out to) all the movie buffs on imdb that get up off the ground, brush it off, lick their wounds, and say, ""look punk, i didn't like it."" It's important to form your own opinion, and i'm sure that there are plenty of people that go around praising this movie when they themselves don't think it was that hot. I do, though, don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. If you haven't seen it, i suggest you should, though, only for the sake of seeing a so called classic.

That's it, for those of you looking for the last sentence sum up. Overatted, but still very good. 3 stars out of 4, 7 out of 10"
4,I don't understand...,"What I don't understand is why so many think this is such a great film. The actors did great, but the whole story to me was boring. I like to see the bad guys get whats coming to them. I think a lot of the guys who watch this kind of idolize them and that's just sad to me. At least it seems that way. Maybe I just like my crime movies to have a more definitive hero. Someone I can root for to come out on top. There are mob/crime family movies I really like so I know its not just the genre I don't care for. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 10 is because the actors were good, otherwise I'd have given it a 1. This is just my opinion of course. I often disagree with critics and ratings so you should watch it and judge for yourself."
10,Indeed a great start to one of the greatest trilogies ever!,"The Godfather is indeed a great start for the trilogy and a great movie alone. The thing that I admired most about this film is the extensive quality of story, you always know whats going on if you listen carefully. It's really dramatic without getting too dramatic which is the fine line between effective and ridiculous, and The Godfather balances on that line perfectly. Cinematography is a part of what gives this movie classic status, the camera work gives the Godfather a slightly sinister effect with the shadows which is more apparent in some scenes set at night.

Performances are top notch from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and of course John Cazale. There much more great performances. The score of The Godfather is probably the best of all time. It helps the drama and settings. The Godfather's sets are really accurate for the time it is portraying and the Italian family environment. Overall this three hour crime family epic is great cinema that is only beaten by part two in my own personal opinion."
10,A really masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Everybody said that this film was the best ever done so I have wanted to see this for years(and the other parts I shall soon see).So when I found out that it would come on DVD I planned to buy it,and so I did. And when I saw it I thought it was an masterpiece.Perfect in every ways. The whole cast acts excellent and Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for best leading role.It´s also a very beautiful epic and the music is fantastic.I almost forgot to write that the direction by Francis Ford Coppola is also excellent.Still it has done better films than ""the Godfather"" but it´s really a Masterpiece.If you don´t own the Godfather collection on DVD run out and buy it now.5/5"
10,Still resonates after all these years,"Wow, this is a great film. Repeated (and I do mean repeated) viewings have not changed its power to fascinate and enthrall after all these years. Like the great Greek tragedies, Godfathers I and II just speak the essential truth about humanity and familial relationships in a way that everyone can relate to and can use to understand their own lives. Great art has the power to do that. All of the elements - screenplay, cinematography, acting, music - come together just about perfectly. Perhaps it is because of an accident of time and place and circumstance, like Casablanca, but it is hard to imagine this film being done any other way, or being remade by anyone else, with another cast. Truly one of the essential movies in the cinematic canon."
10,Perfect in every sense of the word.,"I've seen this movie a dozen times and still believe it is by far the best movie ever made. From the opening sequence where you make the acquaintance of the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his family to the ending scene where Michael Corleone becomes Don Michael Corleone, the new godfather, the movie stays perfect.

Marlon Brando is excellent as Vito Corleone (he won an Oscar for his performance) and Pacino and Caan are great as his sons who have two opposite characters, Pacino is practical and Caan is radical. However, I believe Robert Duvall is the one who distinguishes himself the most as Pacino's and Caan's adopted brother and lawyer of the family.

Many of my favorite scenes of all-time are included in this gem (especially the scene where Michael kills Solottzo and Captain Macluskey in the restaurant). An absolute must-see at any costs."
10,A Masterpiece,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films to ever hit the screens. It is a film that teaches you all the possible lessons in life, having at the same time such a powerful and emotional background story.I have never felt such strong emotions from watching a film before as I did when I saw The Godfather, it takes you in it's world and grasps you by the neck, indulging you in a story that you forever wished you could be a part of yourself. The Godfather is what the true mafia is about, Francis Ford Coppola takes the term ""mafia"" and really put's it into context by showing us nearly every possible situation involved within the mafia and how it has it's affects on family and friends. To conclude, The Godfather in my opinion is the best film of all time and if you haven't yet seen it for some strange reason then please go and watch it, you will not be disappointed."
10,I believe in America,"IMDb Top 250: 2 The Godfather is the single greatest film ever made. A lofty claim, but so far there is not a single picture elsewhere that I feel deserves that title. And you're going to find out why.

The Godfather tells the sprawling tale of the Corleone family, a mafia family after the Second World War. Over the course of the 2 hours and 50 minute epic, you will see the best drama, characters and atmosphere to ever grace the screen.

It starts with the Godfather Waltz theme, an iconic piece. Just like that, the stage is set for the most Italian film ever. I believe it was the producer who wanted Coppola to direct because he was Italian. He wanted audiences to ""smell the spaghetti"" watching this film. Anyway, we then cut to a man's face, talking to an unseen figure, pleading to him for justice. Emotion drips off every word. Every scene in the Godfather has purpose, every line of dialogue has meaning. The camera switches to the other side of the table- Marlon Brando sits, hair slicked, moustache, rose in suit, cat on lap, in all of his glory as Don Vito Corleone, one of the most iconic characters ever.

Have I said 'iconic' a lot? Much of the Godfather is. The Don himself, Michael's rise, Sonny's temper, the offer you can't refuse.

The setting is very important to the Godfather. 1946 New York is wonderfully put together, as well as the hills of Sicily and for a short period of time, Las Vegas. Every scene is full, no scene is filler. Inside of each scene is dialogue- lots of it. But you'll hang on to every word, because of the content and the flawless delivery. Action in the Godfather is sparse, but like the hits shown, short and brutal. You'll be kept on your toes. Anyone can die at any moment, and they do. The pacing is perfect.

The characters are some of the greatest compiled in a film, and any of the major characters could carry a film on their own. The Don's mumble, appearance and honour are perfected by Brando. Pacino convincingly, slowly shows what being in a mafia family can do to even a kind boy who isn't a part of it. Tom Hagen is the logic and calm in the sea of guns and violence. And Sonny, with his temper and tongue steals scenes.

Perfectly executed, the sweeping story is so well interwoven you might not get it all on the first viewing. It all makes sense though: everything happens for a reason, and everything is explained. From the beginning wedding, to the diner, and ending with Michael's transformation, the plot of the Godfather is one of the best.

I hope I've convinced you to see this masterpiece, or if you've already seen it, see it again. No amount of talking can equal to actually seeing it. Better than Shawshank, better than its own Part II, The Godfather is the best movie ever made and you cannot say you love movies until you've seen the Godfather. See this movie, and order a lasagna. 10/10"
6,Oh My Godfather!,"I went into this film with a chip on my shoulder that was determined not to like it and I was only watching it in order to scratch it off of my film poster. I don't like gangster films really, glorifying violence and illegal activities has never been in my wheelhouse, but I have to say that this one was so well made, so well acted and such a good story that I couldn't help but enjoy it.

It starts out with a great pace that takes you through things day by day, which it slightly loses towards the end, when suddenly we are skipping ahead months or years at a time and with a much slower feel to the action, but I was already sold on the film as a whole, so I didn't mind too much at all.

It's obvious why it appears on every top films list I've ever come across. Yes, you could trim about 15 minutes off of it, but at what cost, I don't think that there is anything in this film that shouldn't be there, the perspective shots and set ups are all important I feel. The director, editor and crew in general have all done a fantastic job to bring this Mafioso story to life with a careful and considerate vision.

What I would call the gross bits aren't so offensive to put me off my tiramisu and the bad language is part and parcel, without being overused to prove how bad they are.

It's a shame to see the sweeter and more innocent Michael slowly get drawn in to the trouble, but you can see why he finds that path and that's what makes the story interesting.

The actors all give great performances. Mother thought that Robert Duvall in particular was outstanding for giving us a side of him that we don't see that often in his other roles, which can sometimes be a bit more quirky and I have to say that I agree with the old grotbags.

However, I have always had a thing about Mr Brando that I just can't ignore (If I ever get a time machine, you'll find me in his changing room for 'Streetcar Named Desire'). I thought he was fantastic, especially as he gets older towards the end of the film. I didn't quite understand why he looked like he'd been to the dentist and forgotten to take the cotton wool out though? I'm not sure it added anything, except to add a talking point or a gimmick. Were they trying to make jowls where there were none or was it an old wives tale way of trying to clear his obviously congested sinuses? Whatever it was, he was superb.

Al gave a great performance too, surely paving the way to his lead role in 'Scarface'. I was also incredibly surprised to find myself looking at James Caan with bedroom eyes. My only references to him previously have been 'Elf' and 'Misery', so to see him so youthful and handsome was a pleasant change.

If you like gangster/mobster films then this one is a sure win for you, but even if you don't generally like them you should give it a go.

I have Part II lined up to watch in the next few days. It will be interesting to see where it goes with the fabulous Robert De Niro on board too."
2,Meh,"Overrated. At least I can finally stop wasting money on melatonin now though, I'll just turn this movie on and be asleep within 3 minutes. That's the only reason it's getting more than 1 star."
10,The Godfather Phenomenon in a Nutshell,"The epic adventures of the Corleone family: Don Vito doesn't want to get involved in drugs, because its a dirty business. This causes repercussions and sparks a war among the five families.

The Godfather Phenomenon in a nutshell: people love it for Gordon Willis' exquisite indoor cinematography, the performances, the Scarface value of being able to say sentences in the Don's voice, the in-jokes (give him an offer he can't refuse, go to the mattresses), Nino Rota's iconic musical score, and the iconic scenes (the opening monologue, followed by the Don's first totally quotable speech ""you come into my house on my daughter's wedding day"", the horse's head, Sonny's sprinkler bashing in the busy street, the fruit-market shooting, the toll-way shooting, the gun in the bathroom restaurant scene, the garden fertiliser scene near the end, and the Baptism scene).

There are faults in the second film: i think Fredo goes a little over the top, for instance, but the first Godfather is as close as you'll get to a perfect film. If there was a weakest link, though, it'd probably be Diane Keaton. She does bring an interesting quality to it, I agree, but it always looks like she's reading lines. Luckily, she doesn't have too many.

It can be difficult to follow, due to the fact that its an adaptation of a long, elaborate book - but i think that contributes to its mystery. You always feel like watching it again to try and figure out who killed who and why.

To make a great film, Coppola went back to basics, pure and simple, grande classical storytelling. He took the lessons of the masters to heart, and the result is just one of the best, most beautiful epics in the language.

10/10"
10,Brandos great comeback,"It,s amazing that Marlon Brando could play an Italian gangster so great even if his wasen,t italianamerican.I think it,s sad that Al pacino never got an Oscar for his performance in this movie and not even in the second godfather movie because i think its Al,s great thing in his career.The movie is one of the few movies which has succeed with a great continue but has unlucky failed with the third.The movie has a great story and is a major work of the director Francis Ford Coppola.It is long and got a several actors who breakthrough with the movie and could do more great performances for example Al Pacino and Robert Duvall.Thank you very much Mr Francis Ford Coppola."
9,A Classic Thriller Of All Time,"The Godfather Is Not Only Just a Movie . I mean Its such a Metamorphosis Based On the Novel By Mario Puzo . I rated it 9 Out of ten And I Think That Rating Worth It . Sir Francis Ford Coppola Done a very Good Job and this is Outstanding Man . Whenever I Used To Watched This Movie , I just Lost Myself In The Mafia World Full Of Terrorism and Thriller . And You Know I Never Felt Tired Of This Epic Masterpiece . Whenever I Watched This Movie , Its Still Agitated My Mind Like i was Watching For The First Time . You Know What , To Describe My Latent Feelings About This Movie , Just 1000 Words Wouldn't Be Enough For Me !! So I Better Stop Here .Last One Thing I Want To Say , The Godfather Is One Of My Most Favourite Movie As Well As The Book Of All Time . Every Single Person Should Watch This Epic Masterpiece Before They Die !!"
10,Great!!!!!,"Totally superb from acting to directing to plot to dialogue. Definitely in my top 10 list and a joy to watch over and over again. To be fair there are a few negatives. At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying. Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel. The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon. In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly. You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen.

The character of Lucy was just seen as a tramp used by Santino in the movie where she was a fairly interesting character as well as Johnny Fontaine. Anyone who has seen the movie should also read the book to understand what I mean."
10,Best movie ever made,"Old but Gold.

It's been more than 3 decades after it was released but its influenced still haunting lot of movies and TV series (the recent example is The Sopranos).

I don't want to write the plot in here, I believe moviegoers already familiar about the story line. It was always not about firing a gun but it was always about how a civilian turned into most powerful gangster ever; it was always about people around you might against you at the other days; it was always about the real family around your another family; it was always about the love around family; it was always about how you sacrifice your life for your family.

It might be boring for you who might expecting a gun firing scene and car chasing in the middle of traffic jam; however this movie was not about that.

The story line : 10/10 The greatest concept behind the screenplay is how a civilian turned into a gangster to protect its family.

The acting : 10/10 All actors played perfectly. Special credits to Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.

The directing : 10/10 No more comment on Coppola's direction. Perfect

Soundtrack : 9/10 Very easy to remember the soundtrack

Best Character : Michael Corleone; who else?

Notable quote : ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" - Vito Corleone

Best moment : The Baptism Scene (5 minutes of horror)

Best villain : Carlo

Crappiest Moment : When the Godfather dead in orange farm

Why it's never be boring : Watched how they made their strategy to eliminate their enemies"
6,not the best i have seen,Ok but long story and get a bit boring on some pont
10,One of the all-time greats,"I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and went back again and have seen it numerous times on television since. Francis Ford Coppopla has been fortunate to have not had just a single career defining masterpiece but several and this is one of them. He'll likely have one or two more masterpieces to add to his arsenal of enduring works before he is done. This ensemble cast is wonderful with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Al Martino and on an on. Nonimated for 10 Academy Awards it won surprisingly only three in Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Best Screenplay for Mario Puzo adapted from his novel with Francis Ford Coppola, and the big prize Best Picture. James Caan, AL Pacino and Robert Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, the most ever from a single film in an acting category but so many from the same film caused a split in the vote and Joel Grey from Caberet ended up with the Oscar. Godfather went head to head against Caberet for the 1972 Academy Awards with Caberet wining six to Godfather's three. The Godfather was also nominated for costume design, film editing, sound and music score. Omitted was Gordon Willis with his brilliant cinematography. Willis would go on to be a favorite of Woody Allen in photographing Annie Hall and seven other Allen films. Willis, like many involved in the Godfather would also do Godfather II and III. Production Designer Dean Tavoularis team of Set Decorator Phillip smith and Art Director Warren Clymer give this film a rich look and an excellent period piece atmosphere along with Costume Designer Anna Hill Johnstone. Nino Rota's music score gives the film the flavor of a fine Italian wine. He scored all of Federico Fellini's films in Italy including La Vita Dolce and 8½ as well as scoring such films as La Strada, Obsession, War and Peace and Romeo and Juliet in his long career. This film also features great non-original music from Berlin to Bach and Mozart. Editor William Reynolds would have had quite an ambitious editing project with this three hour film and his skill paid off. The sequel Godfather II was a great film and one of the greatest and most recognized sequels in film history but I would have left it there and not made it a trilogy with Godfather III. I don't know how long this film has been #1 on the IMDb top 250 but it will likely be there in that spot for some time and it will take a film made after it to knock it out of the top spot. Maybe a film not yet made. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it."
10,Film mistakes?,"Has anyone found any interesting mistakes in this film? -- I found one were Don Corleone is being moved in the hospital. He moves his hand very quickly when being taken into the new hospital room even though he isn't supposed to be awake. - There are also some time/space inconsistencies in the scene where Michael shoots the police captain, but I've heard they removed in mistake in later versions of the film. Also, some of the lines at the end of the movie with Don and Michael talking in the olive garden seem to be out of order or ad libbed. -- I've heard that there are others. Just Curious - please let me know! :) Thanks! --"
10,Great Film From a Superior Visionary,"The Godfather is a prime example of a film by a genius who tells a story through his own perceptions and knowledge that prevails to be one of the greatest films ever made..The unflappable tenacity of the man the Director Francis Ford Coppola to display his vision of a time that is seated now in the American mainstream an imprint of Americana, the look, feel and archetype of a time incredibly captured on 35 mm...I have gone back in time to see this great film several times and with each journey I take whilst watching the film I am taken through the story of a mans view of our world and a time once where cities were governed by a darker underbelly of ruthless street thugs posing as upstanding citizens and living by a credo of Family love and death and violence. These kind of epics with their bold performances and matchless chemistry reach the mainstream few times in a lifetime and remain such forever in both the annals of history and realm of entertainment"
10,Marlon the Great,"I don't know why,but since i know about myself i loved mob movies.There is something interesting in the way of a mafioso to the top,and his fall.So it is not a miracle,that The Godfather trilogy is my favourite movie. The Godfather trilogy is a magnificent saga about the Corleone family and it's way to the top of the American mob.Afcourse and their way into the high society of admired people.But,behind this story lies one more story,as complex as the first,about higher values,family,love and respect.It is very interesting to see Vito Andolini's(Marlon Brando) way from his departure from Sicily,where he was on the run because local boss Don Cicci wanted to kill him because he thought that Vito is going to take revenge on him for killing his father and brother,to New York's ''Litlle Itally'' where he is living like a bum.Although Vito had a really small wage,he bought a pear every day and brought it to his wife to show his love,respect and gratitude.Later,Vito became a very wise man and the king of the Mafia. God never gives without taking.Don Vito in one of his wars with the other families lost his oldest son,Sonny(James Caan).So, today we all know a old Mafia saying:For revenge always kill the brother. It means that you never kill the man that brought you harm,but you should kill someone that is closest to his heart.It will hurt more.On this way Vito's youngest son (Al Pacino) and his ''grandson'' (Andy Garcia) will lose their wives.And there is one more thing that the movie shows the best.What money can do to a man!When their parents die Michael kills Fredo because he let him down.Horrible,but logic.

The movie is filled with great actors.James Caan is a real hot-head,old school wise guy.Al Pacino is also great as a man that doesn't want to meddle into family business but then becomes a killer.MARLON BRANDO is.... i really can't find the word to describe it.He made the most known role in the world as the rightful Don.Marlon magnificently paint a portrait of a man who doesn't forget the friendship shown to him and is willing to help anybody that respects him.If somebody shows hate to the Don,he makes him an offer he can't refuse and deals with him quickly.The words that illustrate how much is Brando a good actor,are the words that Nicholson spoke on Brando's funeral:''Now,when Marlon is gone,all we actors will rise a few steps above''.

A unmissable classic"
10,Best Gangster movie of all time,"The classic gangster movie that all others after it aspire to be like. Yes its long, but engaging throughout. A realistic view into the life of being in the mob family from all perspectives, the boss, the wives, the rest of the family, the cops, and the others on the outside. ""Never hate your enemies"" and ""friendship is everything"" are my favorites quotes. Inevitably in the mob world back stabbing and double-crossing happens, and outside of the mob world too."
10,god father,The film is undoubtedly one of the best films in cinema history as the father of the main reasons I think this is a wonderful director Coppola and unique game Marlow Brando and simplicity of the film. One of the best scenes in the movie The Godfather Death. The Godfather II and III as well as the integral of a good father of Fyml the number two and three are transferred. The only weakness of the film is that like a lot of movies and high-axis is the axis of indirect sex is not a crime. With Lpachynv The film also good but I think it adds a major reason for the continued presence of the father.Marlo Brando and AL pa chino is the best actor this film . in the end this film is very nice and in before died must watch .
10,One of the Greatest Films of All Time,"I believe that there is little that need to be said about the ""Godfather"". A true masterpiece, whose characters has become legendary (who has not heard about Don Corleone), has been followed by an equally great sequel (not counting Godfather III which is a good movie but definitely belongs to a lower league than I and II), and has inspired and paved the road for other legendary mafia films (""Goodfellas"", ""Once Upon A Time in America"").

With a large bunch of all-time classic actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, the performances given in Godfather provide the definition of top quality cinema. In short, ""Godfather"" is one of the films that everybody should watch at some point of his/her life. 10/10."
7,Cavemen with guns,"Someone please explain why a movie about a gang who use physical nastiness to get a point across has become so beloved? Because they get away with it? Okay, so it was filmed in the dark...what a breakthrough for the industry. Of course, I do tend to go against the majority somewhat.

It's good enough, but I save higher praises for at least eighty other movies."
1,BORING AND SLOW,I can't understand how people can enjoy this movie when it's so slow and still. I couldn't even stand the first 20 minutes. The atmosphere is all too quiet and it's all just people talking. A lot of people would rate this movie 10/10 and think they're intelligent or something.
10,The Greatest Drama Ever,"The Godfather is the greatest Drama movie ever. This movie has the best plot, acting, and script of all movies ever made. I would recommend it to everyone. Also, Part II is good too.

10 out of 10

***** out of *****

If you liked this movie, I would recommend ""Scarface"""
10,One Of The Greatest Movies Ever,"the godfather is a timeless classic most ages can appreciate. the godfather is one of very few movies that have standed the test of time. the godfather is the best of the trilogy but the godfather pt II is very close but not just the main reason for this is because Marlon Brando isn't in the second part he is truely amazing in the godfather if he hadn't of won best actor oscar for it there would be alot of questions to ask. this was Al Pacinos third movie the previous two not getting him any recognition he changed all this by giving the performance of his life, and if you think hes good in this see part II and even though most reviewers say that part III is terrible i assure you it is not! true it is not as good as the previous 2 but Al Pacino should be enough of a reason to watch part III as he is, as always, amazing. so if you have seen the first Godfather but not the others then just buy the Godfather trilogy on d.v.d thats what i did."
10,Overwhelmed!!,"A Great Movie to watch.

Need not to say more about the great actor Marlon Brando.

Long time ago read this story of Mario Puzo and fascinated by it.

Again seen it in a visual form. Great portrait of the characters from the story.

I liked the scene most( yes, liked other scenes also) the hospital scene and with the gathering of the whole clan of the relatives.

Al Pacino also did a very good job in the movie.

So, I personally recommend this movie a must watch.

A wonderful movie to watch. I personally like the movie."
10,Over all,"This film is an example of a great director, quality actors, outstanding script writing/ screen play and an amazing film score. I love it!

My favorite scene:

Don Corleone: Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

Bonasera: What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.

Don Corleone: What is that? ""Bonasera whispers his request in the Don's ear"" That I cannot do.

Bonasera: I will give you anything you ask.

Don Corleone: We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And, uh, you were afraid to be in my debt.

Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble.

Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend like me. But, uh, now you come to me, and you say: ""Don Corleone, give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money.

Bonasera: I ask for justice.

Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive.

Bonasera: Let them suffer then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you?

Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that wounded your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.

Bonasera: Be my friend – Godfather. ""Bonasera bows toward the Don and kisses the Don's hand""

Don Corleone: Good. Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day – accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.

Bonasera: Grazie, Godfather.

Don Corleone: Prego. Give this to, uh, Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren't going to be carried away. After all, we're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker thinks. The Godfather"
9,Life of Mafia in New York,"Probably I have seen this film 3-4 times and always enjoyed it. The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not."
9,"Near Perfection To The Last Detail,","The Godfather is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There is no questioning the sheer brilliance of this film, it is a perfect example of how movies are very much an art form, the beautiful set pieces and skillfully written dialogue are just two examples of that. The story grabs you immediately, despite the lengthy three hours, it flies by as we are engrossed in to these characters and their struggles, as Roger Ebert once said, a bad movie can never be too short, and a good movie can never be too long. The cast deliver some of the best performances ever witnessed, from the masterful acting of Robert Duvall, the engaging James Caan and the raw emotion of Al Pacino, they all showcase career highlights. The star of the show is, without a doubt, Marlon Brando, an actor with so much range and versatility, he is spellbinding as the Don, every word, every movement, has meaning, a well deserved Oscar win. An engaging story, pitch perfect performances and gorgeous direction, The Godfather is a must see for all moviegoers.

A young man is forced to take control of an organised crime ring as a result of his father's decreasing health.

Best Performance: Marlon Brando"
6,"Peace of sh, t",Very overrated and i waste 3h of my life watching this old movie.. I hate when somebody talk about the godfather's acting
3,What are you people thinking????,"I noticed that this was the best rated film in this place a couple of months ago, so naturally, I decided to give it at shot. But I just don't get what attracts you folks to it?

The character-draving is pretty weak, and you don't really get to go inside the heads of the gangsters. The pictures are pretty ordinary and the whole storyline is... well... boring.

I mean no disrespect or anything, but maybe this is to old folks, what the first King Kong film was to my great granfather... Maybe I'm just part of a next generation... Or maybe.. A next step in the evolution. A superman! A mastermind! Maybe I'm going to be king of the hill! Top of the heap! Maybe I need to find some sleep.

Sorry. This one did nothing for me, but if you're high on gangsters, this is definitly the one for you.

6/10.

I'd love to hear from you folks that thinks this is Gods gift to movies."
10,The Godfather of all movies,"One of,if not,the best movie of all time,The Godfather has it all in terms of drama,violence,etc.The thing that is very special about this movie is that it sets the gangster film archetype in concrete and would inspire future gangster greats such as Scarface,Godfather:Part Two and Three,Goodfellas,Carlito's Way,The Departed,etc.This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola which was adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name.The cast of this movie includes Marlon Brando as the iconic Don Vito Corleone,at the time newcomer Al Pacino as Vito's youngest son,Michael,James Caan as hotheaded Santino""Sonny"",Robert Duvall as Consigliere Tom Hagen,Diane Keaton as Michael's love interest,Kay Adams and John Cazale as Fredo Corleone.It would win the Academy Award for Best Picture,Best Actor-Brando and would additionally receive nominations for Best Supporting Actor-James Caan,Al Pacino and Robert Duvall.One of my favorite films and a crime classic.Bravo!Excellent!"
10,An example of how films should be made. Perfect.,"There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said already but that's not going to stop me praising this film. Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films ever made and is often considered to be the best by many. For an explanation, it's impossible to pick any one reason as this is a near perfect film with all elements set perfectly in place.

A very important part of The Godfather's iconic status is Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. His profile from the first film has provided a symbol which represents all three films, despite Brando only being in the first instalment, and an icon that commands respect. Brando appeared long finished as an actor, his looks diminishing and his status being lost but his classic performance in The Godfather put him firmly back on the acting map, where he now has a permanent place. His performance is excellent in this film, despite his mouth being crowded by moth balls! OK, so you can't hear every word he says, but you don't need to when his body language and non-verbal cues say so much for themselves. The character of Vito is very powerful, yet very frail and Brando puts these two qualities in perfect juxtaposition. A classic display, which still gets talked about 30 years on. Al Pacino whose film career was just beginning with this film, is also fantastic and ensured that wherever the film was plot wise, that powerful displays were on show at all times. His character transformation is compelling and his storyline with Diane Keaton is intriguing to give Godfather a more personal atmosphere and also to provide a much deeper plot. This film is seen as a landmark for acting, with Brando winning an Academy Award and with Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duval all receiving nominations.

Central to the films core is the plot which is so intensely dramatic, that two hours does not seem enough to justify such a story. There are dozens of relationships involved in this story and there is an assassination plot and both Michael and Vito Corleone have their own separate storyline. All of these are done fantastically, ensuring the audience can have full empathy for all the characters and also be thoroughly entertained. Mario Puzo is clearly a gifted writer and does a fantastic job of portraying criminal organisations and what goes on in these families, a true representation or not, it makes for a fantastic film. Whilst his success in film was mainly limited to The Godfather series and Superman, Puzo must be gifted to write such material and was definitely worthy of the awards he won. The Godfather is a prime example of what is missing in most of today's films; a character driven plot. This film shows that you do not need explosions and high octane chases to keep an audience gripped and that a quality script and fascinating characters are enough to amass an audience.

This is all wonderfully brought together by Francis Ford Coppola who, because of this film, has left his mark on the film world for eternity. It is the atmosphere he builds in this film that makes it so effective. Everything is dark and bleak except for when Pacino is exiled but that ends in tragedy. Coppola does brilliantly to emphasise the point that the world of criminal organisations is not a nice place and that no matter how safe you feel, your fate is waiting for you just around the corner. The film contains very little in the way of set pieces, instead everything appears very intimate, highlighting how personal the Mafia can be. The uncompromising nature of the film must have been very shocking at the time as there is a lot of violence that would have been skirted around at the time.

The classic score to The Godfather is also integral to the film as it compliments all the visual elements on the screen. The sophisticated appearance of the Mafioso for instance and the general demeanour of the higher ranked gangsters are emphasised by the slow classical music.

This film is responsible for most of the post modern approach to film making and acting and his also the landmark to which other crime movies compare themselves. The Godfather's image and style live to this day and will for generations to come. The first of a fantastic series, Godfather is an example of how films should be."
10,One of the Best!,"For me, this movie is definitely one of the best movies! 10*"
9,A cinema classic,"This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.

The real story of the Godfather is how Michael changes from being an ordinary citizen with no desire to be involved in the gangster lifestyle to eventually become the head of the family. The catalyst for this is the attempted assassination of Vito during a mafia war caused by Vito's unwillingness to become involved in drugs.

The acting is quite superb and you shouldn't forget that Al Pacino was a relative unknown when this was released. Marlon Brando won the best actor award for Vito. The screenplay is superb and like all the best films you become extremely involved with several of the characters. A true classic."
9,Great Movie,"This movie was great. The movie had a great cast and an amazing story line. It showed how a person can really change after something really bad happened in their lives. I was in a history class last year and I never realised how horrible these years really were(with the gangs, like Al Capone) This movie was really great!!"
9,Coppola's finest,Coppola's finest movie and arguably Pacino's finest performance. The high point of the 'New Hollywood'.
10,Amazing Movie,"For me.. This is the best movie ever.. A great story, super stars actors plus awesome acting.. It shows deep inside the world of Mafia in Italy and how it moves to New York (USA) early 1930th.. The way Don Vito rolled the Mafia (including all families) and how he was at one side killing and smuggling for the Mafia (Family) benefits, he was on the other side helping (Poor) people to have what they are looking for!! Don Michael is an excellent story too, the realistic man who was serving in US Army during WW2 1945, turned to be at the critical time to unify his family killing all enemies and keeping them all under his umbrella as a new Godfather! I strongly recommend watching this movie.."
6,Padding time: the movie,"Yup, this movie could have been stripped down to something like an hour and an half runtime without the unnecessary, boring scenes that do nothing other than add time over time and the result would be the exact same. Couple that with a non-existant, nonsensical plotline that makes those in superhero tokusatsus shows (series that I love with all myself but that no toku fan watches for their ""plotlines"") look like ancient mythological sagas of old spanning over thousand of years, dialogues repeated over and over and over with no reason whatsoever (particularly the third time you hear the one liner about the offer you can't resist it gets clear they used it as a forced marketing tool) and barebone performances by the main actors and actresses and you have one of the most overrated movies of the century if not the most overrated movie of all times. Even the action is a bit lacking, IMHO.

Check out Il Boss by Ferdinando di Leo with some of the same actors present in this one (Richard Conte and Corrado Gaipa) and you should have a far more interesting and less snooze-inducing experience overall. Hell, even Milano Calibro 9 managed the ""mafia men are honorable people with morals!"" (they aren't and never have been) trope better than this movie did on its own."
2,Unbelievable - this is Number 1? ?,"A good job I saw it when it was originally released in the cinema.

Because it has never been worth watching since. I usually lose interest after the first party sequence.

At the time this was a groundbreaking film, with an excellent performance from Marlon Brando, it's easy to see why they paid him his astronomical fee despite his short time on screen, and it could well have been a momentous flop without him.

But this film definitely does not stand the test of time, unlike say 'Goodfellas' 'African Queen' Spartacus etc, very few films do.

How it got to number one is beyond comprehension, a very minor classic at best, which has since been done to death by the even more inferior clones, nowadays all very dreary and boring.

'Lawrence of Arabia' now there's a film really worthy of the number 1 spot."
10,This can be the ultimate display of perfection,One of my absolute favorite films of all time. A masterpiece without any compare in its genre. Please note that there is not one detail to complain about in this film. As much as I love Part 2 the original is in a class for itself. 10 out of ten .. no doubt.
10,Umm the best movie ever... No question,"This should have won the acadamy award for best movie ever made. It has awesome action. I think that everybody did a great job on it. Marlon Brandon deserved the Oscar he won. He did a great job on his role. My favorite character in the movie is James Cann's role ""Sonny Corleone"". He did a great job in it. Especially when he kicked Carlo's ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino's amazing career. Everybody remembers James Cann for his role, and the same for Marlon Brando's role. CHICA CHICA YEAH!

BJK"
10,An Offer You Can't Refuse at All l!!,"The Godfather stands as the ultimate film in the Mafia and gangsters genre. I don't think it could have been improved in any way. A very interesting story, tremendous action scenes, great special effects, outstanding performances, strong direction, not a single sequence in excess, a good soundtrack, perfect timing, details carefully attended to, well defined characters, etc, etc.

Marlon Brando's acting is perfect. In a cast with such top actors as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale -among many others- he clearly stands out. In fact, I had the feeling that their performances got even better -if possible- after Brando passes away and is out of the picture. Few Oscars for Best Actor have been awarded with more justice than the one Brando got in this one. Old timers -even for 1972- Sterling Hayden and Richard Conte both in short roles, are also a major nostalgic ingredient that raises the movie for those of us who saw them often on the screen through the 50's.

No much more to say on this extraordinary film except perhaps that the two sequels that followed, great movies too, are one clear step below The Godfather."
10,One of the Greatest Movies of all time,"Yes I'm talking about The Godfather. It's one of the best motion pictures out there. I don't know if it should be at #1 on IMDPs top 250, but it definitely belongs in the top 10.

So many stars. Al Pacino looks so young in this picture, as does James Caan with all the dark hair. They are two of three brothers in the Corleone family. Michael (Pacino) is the youngest and wants nothing to do with the family business, but Sonny (Caan) is easily angered and flies off the handle a lot, especially when it involves the abuse of his sister Connie (Talia Shire). They have another brother named Fredo (John Casale), but he does not have the leadership ability of the other two.

Seeing over all of this is the late great Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. He is father too all the Corleone children and is also known as the Godfather by everybody else. He wields the most power, but that power is tested by four other powerful families who are also vying for what the Don has. This leads too much deceit and murder as the leaders of the other four families look to unseat Don Corleone from the top.

This movie is 175 minutes long. Usually when I watch a drama that long, I am unable to get through it. Not so with the Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed, manages to keep you're interest throughout. Yes the film moves at a leisurely pace, but it is never boring. His directing is helped greatly by the actors who give some of their greatest performances ever. Marlon Brando definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.

It is also interesting to watch how Pacino's character Michael changes as the film goes on through to the end. The sequence during the baptism is one of the best ever. I could say more about that, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen this great great film.

Is this the single greatest movie of all time? I don't know about that, but it is definitely ONE of the best films of all time and deserved the Oscar for Best Picture in 1972. How can anybody think this movie is dull is beyond me."
9,We Can't Refuse,"When tackling something of the sheer breadth of Puzo's novel, the screenplay problem becomes not what should be included, but what should be left out.

Coppola and Puzo mostly get this right - staying away from minor story threads, and sticking with the broad cinematic sweeps of post-war New York and Sicily.

It's when the camera moves indoors that we get enveloped in Coppola's world -- this is where cinematographer Willis cut his teeth, and left a stamp on how movies use lighting ever after -- we can luxuriate in the shadows, congruent with the shady back-room world of mob dealings. The true importance of the movie lies in this, not within the vicissitudes of tit-for-tat murders.

Coppola could have played with the Fontaine thread, which is all about the control of Hollywood (and by extension, control of us) through movie vision, but this is almost completely ignored here.

One nice touch, straying from the novel; Moe Greene gets it in the eye -- layered symbolism -- of how one 'vision' of the Corleone future is snuffed out, in favor of the violent ""New Cinema"" paradigm.

Because Coppola's vision of the narrative was constrained by Puzo's platform, he couldn't quite reach the summit -- that would be achieved in ""Part II""."
8,A movie you can't refuse.,"Living up to the edge of this film is what each mob film stands for. This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola's first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is a magnificent performance that really gets into the character of a true mob leader, making offers people can't refuse. Coppola's best work ever, and one of the greatest films ever made!"
8,The bloom is (slightly) coming off the rose,"There is greatness in ""The Godfather"". There is no denying that. I've seen it a bunch of times. There are too many great moments to mention but there are a few dull moments too. Maybe it's because it's always on tv. Maybe it's because I've hear quotes from this movie for the past 49 years. Maybe I've read too much about the making of this film. I don't know. It's still a really good movie. Don't get me wrong. It's just that I don't think the total package is as great as I used to think."
6,At the funeral scene there is a woman on Michael's jacket. It looks like the sunlight at first then you can see her if you pause the movie.,"The scene at the funeral Michael is sitting down talking and the woman appears on his shoulder. When he goes to stand up, another woman appears on the same side. It is very quick and the movie can be paused to see it clear. If you have a DVD you can pause it and fast forward very slow and you can see the first woman open her eyes and smile. Has anyone ever noticed this or is it apart of the movie. If you have not please watch the movie and tell me anything you know about it. It was very weird and my family and i just noticed it last night and we really would like to know what it might be or mean. We don't know if it was a mistake made in the movie or if the woman was meant to be in it. If anyone has any information on this please let us know. If you look very close you can tell that the woman you see at first is different from the second. It is very easily mistaken for the sunlight. She is there through the whole conversation but not as clear when Michael leans forward and she is on the dark part of his jacket. When you watch this make sure the whole time your watching the funeral scene you watch it slow as possible. It very easy to miss. PLease comment when you see it!!!! Thank you"
1,#1??? Bull!,"Ok, I'll admit, I liked the Godfather, but #1 movie of all time? That is sickening! A good movie is not a movie that is ""fun"", if it was, then #1 would be a bad James Bond movie. Any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you MEANING outside of the theater, not a movie about false organized crime! How the hell did this movie get #1 if it's just a movie about killing? The only movie I can think of that should get #1 is American Beauty."
10,an exceptional piece of art,"The godfather to me is the most intricately made, neo-realistic film ever. It is the singular film that inspired me to become a film maker. Everything about the movie, from the plot, score, lighting, cinematography and neo-realistic nature appeals to that part of me that craves for expression via film making. I particularly adore the way don corleone was lit throughout the movie. I also got the opportunity to see the behind the scenes footage shot by a fresh out of college guy and it gave me more insight into the thinking behind the final project. Finally, for a seemingly low budget movie; when the budget is compared to some other movies made in the same era, i must say it's a winner any day, anytime. Every time i conceive a new score or soundtrack for any of my movie projects, I always hear the soundtrack of the godfather i my head."
10,Movies just don't get any better than this,"What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times. This is one of those movies that just holds you in thrall from beginning to end, with no let up in interest or involvement - an amazing feat under any circumstance but almost unheard of for a three-hour movie! As such, it's interesting to compare this with more recent epic-length films of today. A couple years ago, on its 25th anniversary re-release I saw this in the theater on the same day I saw ""The English Patient"". The difference in the two films was just amazing. The English Patient wasn't bad or anything, it's just that it was way too long for the story it told; a good 90 minute-to-2 hour premise was padded out with gorgeous but pointless scenery, an unnecessary subplot, and a shooting and acting style which emphasized dragging things out just for their own sake. The Godfather, by comparison, crams every single minute of its running time with richness, characterization, intrigue, etc. - so much so that, for me, the film actually seems SHORTER than its running time would lead you to believe. There's so many movies that could learn from this - movies that want to be epic length to inflate the importance of their subjects, but just arent' interesting enough to hold us for that long. Many films are guilty here, from Titanic to The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Green Mile - even such ""great"" films as Lawrence of Arabia and (yes) Shindler's List use their lengths more as endurance tests (i.e. if you can't stay interested through the whole thing than you must be somehow boorish or unfeeling) and as proofs that the directors just became so enamored of their subjects that they couldn't bear to take anything out than as necessary for the telling of their stories. Sadly, I must say that, in my opinion, even The Godfather Part II falls victim to this tendancy - definitely one of the most overrated and unnecessary sequels of all time.

But if you want to see the Corleones (and Francis Ford Coppola) when they were all at the top of their game and everything was just cooking, go back and watch this movie. Even after all the imitations, the rip-offs, the parodies and the cultural appropriations of lines like ""Make him an offer he can't refuse"" and ""He sleeps with the fishes"" to the point where the movie sometimes seems as entrenched (and as tired) as cliches like ""Mom, God and apple pie"" --- once you start watching all of that stuff flies out the window and you're amazed to learn that, wonderfully, this film has lost none of its edge or entertainment value in the nearly thirty years of its existence.

(BTW Don't anyone get the idea that I am against the concept of long movies - some of my all time favorites besides The Godfather are Apocalypse Now, 2001:A Space Odyssey, The Deer Hunter, and Oliver Stone's Nixon. It's just that, I believe, a film really has to justify that running time, because it so opens the door to pretension and indulgence.)"
10,"In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.","This isn't the first time I have seen this film, but circumstances have given me a chance to see it in a new light.

I bought a Blu Ray player, and this film was recommended as the film to see in the new format. I was not disappointed. The richness of the color made the film an extreme pleasure.

I also watched it with captions to not miss a word of the dialog.

There is nothing new that can be said about this film. It is a classic, and the actors are all superb, as is the story itself. It is rare that a film like this comes around, and watching it in Blue Ray just made it all extra special."
10,"Best movie - ""The Godfather""","The remarkable movie was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out. ""The Godfather"" himself is the central character in the drama."
3,It insists upon itself,"Peter: But since we're all gonna die, there's one more secret I feel I have to share with you. I did not care for The Godfather. Lois: What? Peter: Did not care for The Godfather. Chris: How can you even say that, dad? Peter: Didn't like it. Lois: Peter, it's so good! It's like the perfect movie! Peter: This is what everyone always said. Whenever they say... Chris: Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, I mean, you never see, Robert Duvall! Peter: Fine. Fine. Fine actor, did not like the movie. Brian: Why not? Peter: Did not...couldn't get into it. Lois: Explain yourself. What didn't you like about it? Peter: It insists upon itself, Lois. Lois: What? Peter: It insists upon itself. Lois: What does that even mean? Chris: Because it has a valid point to make, it's insisted! Peter: It takes forever getting in; you spend like six and a half hours... You know, I can't get through, I've never even finished the movie. I've never seen the ending. Chris: You've never seen the ending?! Stewie: How can you say you don't like it if you haven't even given it a chance? Lois: I agree with Stewie. It's not even fair. Peter: I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it, and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs. Lois: Yeah, it's a great scene. I love that scene. Peter: I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different... You know, that's where I lose interest in it. Lois: You know what, Peter, Chris: They're speaking Italian! Lois: The language they're speaking is a language of subtlety; it's something you don't understand. Peter: I love The Money Pit. That is my answer to that statement. Lois: Exactly. Peter: Well, there you go. Lois: Whatever. Chris: I like that movie too."
8,"Just a Bit Too Long, but Still Pretty Great","The Godfather has great scenes, classic characters, classic dialogue, and an amusing look into the Italian mafioso, but it's just a tad bit too long to be perfect, in my opinion as a new viewer. There were many scenes that were riveting and performances that were, at times, mesmerizing, but I just feel like it is a little overrated.

It deserves its due credit, no doubt, for without it, so many great movies and tv shows inspired by it would have never been made, and the ground it therefore broke will always hold its place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Some scenes were just too drawn out, lengthened, or long-winded, and it can therefore become a little bit of a chore to watch and enjoy in one sitting, as good as it can be at certain points.

I can see how when this came out in 1974, it was so popular and how it held up throughout the years to be considered one of the best movies ever made, but in my experience in watching other movies since then of this genre, I can list at least 5 I enjoy at least just as much if not more. Obviously, those films have been inspired by the Godfather so without it they wouldn't likely exist in the fashion that they do, but they are still better paced, more suspenseful at times, and just more entertaining overall.

This doesn't mean that the Godfather isn't a classic and one of the best, but it is a matter of taste, and the Godfather still remains a movie I have to really be in the mood for to sit through. Certain scenes, or parts, of this epic hold up much more than others, while other parts and scenes can feel like a slog to sit through.

8/10"
10,Greatest of all,"Godfather is the movie of the century and as far as i know it will stay at the top of the movie in another 5 to 10 century's.Since today I haven't seen a movie like Godfather. The story is too tragedy and it keeps you on watching the movie. The story takes you in the movie. They planning is too good! I have seen most of the mafia, police, tragedy and all of the same sort but in my opinion if you compare them to godfather, the highest will get 6/10 while Godfather gets 10/10. The main character of the movie ""Don Vito Corleone"" looks and act like a proper don. His personality and the way he talks is my favorite. Trust me when you watch the movie remember to notice how he talks and how he plans things. Hes a real G."
10,EPIC,"The trilogy is an EPIC MOVIE. It depicts many real stories, real Sicilian family values, and what masterpiece truly is."
10,Why don't they make films like this anymore?,"Why don't they make films like this anymore? This is what movies should be. Sure, they don't have to be this long, but 99% of todays movies are pretty weak compared to this. It's funny actually, I knew this was one of the most famous classics before I saw it. I knew it is considered among the top 10 films almost everywhere. Yet everyone I know has either referred to it as the most boring film in history or never even bothered to finish it. Now that I've seen it I can't help but think, what a pity. Today we are given so much garbage, that when a real film comes along, we are suddenly confused. We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along. Francis Ford Coppola made a timeless film with the godfather, and he should rank among the top ten, no the top five directors of all time. Stanley Kubrick once said: ""Coppola sure got it right with The Godfather"". And I dare todays director to ""get it right"" in the future.

I give this film a 10/10."
8,Marlon Brando totally believable,"Excellent adult move. Love the music. I could have watched this all day long. Perfect length, if anything too short. Marlon Brando really defines the role of an Italian mafioso patriarch. I permanently learned the phrase, ""make them an offer they can't refuse."" Al Pacino gives another brilliant performance as the son who get drawn into his father's business, bit by bit. Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino's character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable. Just thinking about the movie brings to mind the musical score second to the character, the Godfather played by Marlon Brando. So powerful!"
10,The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen.,"There are many reasons that I say that The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen. For one, though it was made in the 70s, 1972 to be exact, it feels very modern. It's truly a timeless classic. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed and co-wrote the film, did an amazing job in the making of this film. The screenplay, which was co-written by Mario Puzo who also wrote the book of the same name, is the best that I have heard in any movie. Then there is the acting, which I think is not only the best ensemble of acting in a movie, but also that Marlon Brando, who in my opinion is one of the all-time greatest actors, put on the best performance in the role of Don Vito Corleone than any other actor did for any movie and any character. It is incredible to watch. There is no question why he won the Oscar for best actor, as well as the film winning for best adapted screenplay and for best picture. A must watch for any movie lover. It's ""an offer you can't refuse""."
6,The most over rated movie I have ever seen,"Why oh why is this 'the second best movie ever' according to imdb? Do we really need to sit through 2,5 hours of nothing to see for just a little bit of action in the last 10 minutes? Gangster movies can be entertaining, just ask Scorsese. This was nearly 3 hours of trying to keep awake just because of the high rating. Thanks but no thanks. Hopefully the second one will be better but I have my doubts after seeing this one."
4,Hmmm no.,"2/3 - acting 1/3 - storyline 1/3 - cinematic.

Start of really good and I lose interest in around 1/4 part of the movie, and completely disappointed. If you like movie like selling drugs and more actions I think it is not for you or indeed I'm really not into action movies."
10,America's Closest Equivalent to a Tragic Italian Opera,"The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.

The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, ""I believe in America."" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.

Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), ""the Godfather"" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of ""the Godfather""), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.

Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.

""The Godfather"" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo ""the Turk"" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.

The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.

Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. ""The Godfather"" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. ""The Godfather"" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing."
10,THE FINEST MAFIA FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN,"The title says it all.I absaloutly adore this film.Some say part II is the best but I wouldn't really agree.Excellent performances from Marlon Brando,Al Pacino and James Caan as the Family.The perfect film for a Friday night,and a Saturday etc"
10,The film that every crime drama after and to this day is inspired by.,"This film is pretty much one of those perfect movies. I see nothing wrong with this amazing film. The acting is fantastic, the score is excellent, the writing is great, and the cinematography is beautiful. When people think perfection in film making they usually either think ""Citizen Kane"" or this. It is expertly told story that spans through many years. The characters are great, and the relationships they have feel real. The story unfolds excellently, and by the time it is over you felt like you were part of the film. It is without a doubt the most influential crime drama ever made. This film is pure artistry at its finest.

4 stars out of 4"
10,No other movie can touch it.,"Hmmmm... well... I spent some time thinking about what I would write about this movie. First off, I am very disappointed I can´t give this movie a 11. Because you see... it is that good. It is nothing more and nothing less than perfection- if they cut a part of the moive, I would miss it. If they add anything to it, I would discard it. Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?

I am very sad a lot of people that voted for American Beauty made it look like as good as this one. I mean... we cannot compare both movies, can we? If this one drops one rank because of pityful American Beauty, i will be very sad. And I just can imagine anyone giving this one a 1. 7 at least. Not 1 or 2 or 3. People who give ratings like this to a movie such as The Godfaher must only like unimaginative amateur movies such as American Beauty. Sorry I am talking about another movie, but I just can´t imagine The Godfather loosing one rank to American Beauty."
9,Brando rules,"The most famous mafia movie ever made is still the best and the standard by which all others are judged. Maroon Brando transforms himself into Don Corleone, a mob boss of the old school which is changing in the new and violent drug culture.

Al Pacino is Michael, his son and most likely heir apparent. A power struggle ensues with the five families of New York. The bloodshed is horrific but also poetic in hands of director Francis Ford Coppola, who only came close again with ""Apocalypse Now.""

Jame Caan is Sonny, the other of the godfather's sons. Sonny is brutal and the opposite of Michael, who has just graduated college but is lured into a life of crime by circumstance.

The highlight is a baptism used as a counterpoint to a massacre simultaneously. Just sit back an watch the unmatched Brandon devour the screen."

6,"Wow, but not so wow.","This is a great film. And it is also the most over-hyped film of all time. I enjoyed the script and the acting. A little slow in some spots, and it failed to grab my attention emotionally. But it was a good 8/10."
9,The best film ever made.,"Well, after reading the other comments I can only conclude that I have nothing to add. This is the best movie ever made. I can recite what others have said, but I won't. Thank God he created everybody who has helped making this film. And to the one person on this world, who didn't like it: Sorry for you, you're life won't be complete."
10,Blabla,Blablabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla
10,My second favorite movie of all time.,"I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse."
10,Greatest Movie Ever Seen,"I Think The People Know The Godfather and don Vito Corleone and His Family are more than people Go cinemas godfather trilogy is complex of excellent directing acting writing charactering costume design somebody likes Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption or any Movie But I am Sure All of Them agree with me godfather is Greatest Picture of Cinema for Example Don Vito Corleone is symbol of gangsters no Al Capone or Acting of Al Pacino the Great he change the acting for all of history but a great question is why ford Coppola never back to golden age after apocalypse now. if he repeat masterpieces I am sure he became great director of all time. see the godfather and enjoy it because it is not for 1970s it's a movie for all time"
10,worth every watch!,"Right from the initial ever-so-slow zoom into a terrified sit down with Don Corleone, we are baptized into the family by means of respect and, more pointedly, fear. You are set up and then walking the fine line between victim and family throughout. Quoted ad infinitum, the story itself is quite involved and is only topped by the frenetic ending. Dark and hypocritical, this is a convoluted ride to places better left on the big screen (which we now all have at home).Brando, Pacino, Duval and James Caan all deliver most convincingly, while the other actors, or soldiers (if you will) carry out their orders dedicatedly. Frances Ford Coppola struck cinema gold with the Mario Puzo best seller!"
10,Copollas Grand Entry--------and its Perfect,"Francis Ford Coppola was 33 years old in 1972. That was the year of The Godfather. Coppola raised the bar---in relation to directing a movie. Things in movie land would never be the same. This was a great craftsman at work...and The Godfather became a land mark movie. Other films would be compared to the real thing, and very few got anywhere near this original Classic. Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don't care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando. He got Brando. Brando was great. This is one of those rare movies where all the planets align-----and everything works perfectly. Acting, screen play, music, etc.etc. Hell....even the best boy was the best, best boy in history !!"
7,"Great moments, but disjointed and slow in parts","Some memorable sequences, in particular a string of assassinations intercut with the family at church, but too many overly long scenes. To me the film seems disjointed, and is let down by poor central performances (yes poor) by Brando (hammy), Pacino (stiff) and Keaton (invisible).

The Conversation, which Coppola directed a couple of years later, is a better film, with a brilliant performance from Hackman. But even that takes an hour to get moving."
5,I dont really get why people like these kinds of movies,I watched the godfather twice now and still dont like it i watched it with my dad 4 months ago did not like it watched it with my whole family 2 months ago still dont like it i guess i just dint like these movies like goodfellas and the godfather because all ths characters are terrible people
10,Does Power Always Get It Right ?,"'The Godfather' left me in many emotions. Lucky to witnessed such cinema? Yes, but my summary says my current expression. Does Power Always Get It Right ?

'The Godfather', known to be one of the greatest films ever made, is a stab on it's viewer. Francis Ford Coppola has directed it with his instincts, he knows that Mr.Vito Corleone & Family do not exist in real-life. What embodies in an otherwise great film, are it's performances. Late Marlon Brando is stunning as The Godfather. 'THE' actor inside him buries his past and beings a fresh journey here. James Caan as Sonny, is another astonishing performance.

'The Godfather' not only personifies power, but also it's MAJOR disadvantages. Let me end this review, this way: If a 1000 plus word review justifies this masterful depresso, I better inform you, that, even a half-page review is a near-perfect respect."
10,An American Masterpiece: An Offer You Cannot Refuse,"Based on Mario Puzzo's book, The Godfather translated to the screen is an American masterpiece in the study of management and command. As a serious film it is one of the few American films which rises above syrupy American romantic comedy.

Meet Vito Corleone (Marlin Brando). He's a self made American gangster who came up biting and crawling. The American mob however is different from its Sicilian progenitor racked with such vendetta driven violence that whole cities are decimated. The American offspring is a business. Wars (going to the mattresses) happen according to one character only every 10 years and then only to flush the trash out of the ranks, almost a statement one might expect to hear from a career military man.

Don Vito wants to make his second son Michael (Al Pacino), a war hero into a real American of culture, rank, and distinction. Third Son Sonny (James Caan)will head the mob. Elder Son Fredo (John Cazale)is a dolt the others will have to look after. Adopted son, a non-Italian, Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) slides through a shadowy zone of near legitimacy as an attorney for the mob.

War strikes. Rival gangsters want to sell drugs. The Don is firm but is almost assassinated; Sonny is killed. Only Michael is left to head the family business, defeating the Don's grand design. Will Michael survive to keep both the biological and mob family together?

Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin), an official suborned by the mob, tells Michael that ""The Family"" is Michael's delusion.

It was an all-star performance by the entire cast.

Though I read the book many years ago. I hesitated to see the movie out of respect for the sentiments of many Italians who believe the film to be anti-Italian. After watching the film many years after its release I decided it is not anti-Italian as much as it is the finest study of leadership the American theatre has exhibited. Only Twelve O'Clock High (Gregory Peck) and Major Dundee (Charlton Heston; Richard Harris) come close in the study of the personality of command.

I prefer the combined version of Godfather I & II.

In the gangster film genre, the comparables ST VALENTINES DAY MASSACRE (Jason Robarts), CAPONE (Ben Gazzara), VALACHI PAPERS (Charles Bronson), and LEPKE (Tony Curtis) are all great in their own right with splendid acting but nonetheless they barely approach the eloquence of THE GODFATHER."
10,Amazing,"The godfather movie have best quality and a lot of action , I really enjoyed the movie it's pretty amazing it would be best if were more action with those persons. I watched two times For the best A M A Z I N G the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring"
10,Copolla made us an offer we couldn't refuse,"¨I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.¨ Many people consider the 70's to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least one of these films is on everybody's favorite movies list, and The Godfather is considered by many critics to be the best film of all time. Despite being nominated for eleven Oscars it only took home three (Best Picture, Best Performance by Marlon Brando, and Best Screenplay), just one more confirmation that a film can't be judged by the amount of awards it receives. The Godfather deserves much more. It is a movie that has transcended time and is enjoyed by everyone even decades after its first release. It was the first of its kind to portray the mafia from the inside and Coppola does a great job at romanticizing them and making us root for these criminals. How does he do it? By showing us the mafia as a strong and united family that supports each other; portraying the good guys as bad (there are corrupt cops and politicians); and making Vito Corleone stand out from the rest of the criminal families by not wanting to get involved in the drug business. He completely romanticizes the Corleone family and has us rooting for them from the very first scene thanks to a very intelligent script co-written with Mario Puzo who had previously written the bestselling novel. The script is amazing, the performances are great, and the direction from Coppola is just superb. All these elements combine perfectly to create this classic masterpiece.

We are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the opening scene. He is head of one of the five New York Mafia families, and is attending his daughter's wedding. The wedding serves as a great excuse for Coppola to introduce all the characters because the entire family is gathered at the wedding. Vito is the Godfather for many of the people invited and he is treated with a great deal of respect. Tradition has it that no Sicilian can refuse requests on their daughter's wedding day, so Vito is attending some of his associates who are in need of favors. His sons Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale) are in the family business along with Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the family lawyer and consigliere, who was adopted by Vito at a very young age and is like a son to him as well. His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a World War II veteran shows up with his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) and is talking to her about his family. This conversation also serves as a perfect excuse to hear anecdotes about the family's criminal life and we are informed at once that Michael is the only one who is not involved in the family business. He has decided to stay away from the criminal lifestyle and is respected by his family. The entire plot takes place inside the world of the Corleone family and during a time where significant change begins to take place. Vito will have to make an important decision whether or not the family should protect a wealthy man named The Turk (Al Lettieri) who is trying to bring heroin into the city, or stick to the harmless gambling and alcohol business. He better think things carefully because his decision could have consequences.

The Godfather is without a doubt a masterpiece and the cast has a great deal to do with it. James Caan and Robert Duvall had worked with Coppola in his previous film, The Rain People, and now they returned again with significant roles. They give great performances, but who really stands out in this movie is Marlon Brando who really becomes the Don. He gives one of the most memorable and all-time best movie performances in film history. Al Pacino hadn't made a significant movie before and the transformation he goes through in this film is incredible. His character is the one who experiences the most change if we recall his first appearance in the wedding and his last one in the Baptism scene. The screenplay is also very well written, the story completely hooks us from the very beginning, the characters are unforgettable, and Coppola just did a great job with the direction as he immersed us inside this world of crime. Of course we know that the mob world isn't anything like this and it has been romanticized by Hollywood, but Coppola managed to make us care for these criminals who actually don't see themselves as the villains. Nino Rota's score is just amazing and breathtaking; it helps build the suspense.The Baptism parallel action scene is one of the best ones in film history and has since been imitated endlessly in most action films, although never with the same effect. This is required viewing for everyone, one of the greatest achievements in film history.

10,I don't get it,"Ok, I'm two hours into this film and I just don't get the hype and appeal. I admit my choices in movie are varied (my top five films are ""American Beauty"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Casablanca"", ""Henry V"" and ""When Harry Met Sally""), but I watched this film with possibly too much expectation. A friend of mine adores this film, and any Mafia film in general, and along with the vast majority of imdb members, he recommended this film to me. The problem is, why?

Don't get me wrong though, before someone starts to condemn me, I appreciate the acting, I understand that Al Pacino performs stunningly throughout, I admit that Marlon Brando is another highlight (although his voice annoys me slightly throughout), but I just don't see why people adore this film. Ok, after reading reviews, the obvious differences between people are blatant. Some people adore this film and consider it the best ever, some dislike it. All that is fair enough. Sadly though, I feel I am slightly more towards the later. I don't dislike this film, it has highlights, but I can't help but feel it is long winded, infuriatingly complicated & at times, ridiculously slow. Graphically, it is superb, acting is tremendous, but I just feel the plot doesn't hold upto scratch.

Perhaps I am a fool, but I just fail to get the hype. Perhaps if I was more of a fan of Mafia films I'd appreciate it more, perhaps. Perhaps if I'd seen it at the cinema in 1972 I'd love it, perhaps. However, after watching it at such a relatively late age of 20 in 2003, I might enjoy this film, I might like a few scenes a lot, but I really fail to understand how it could make it to number 1 in people's lists. I guess in the end of the day, it is all down to opinion."
7,Part 1,"Don't get me wrong, it was good, a pretty damn good film. But I read the book before I saw this film so I felt like the audience got skimped out on a lot of great and important details. And I'm sorry to say but Brando did not give The Don the justice he deserved. In the book The Don is beyond words. And Brando was simply excellent.

Overall though I really dug it, I'm excited to see part 2"
4,Overrated,"I watched this movie, trying not to set my hopes too high, after everything i had heard about THE GODFATHER. I think its overrated. It's an OK story. But i do not think that this movie should be worshiped the way it is. I think most people say its the greatest movie of all times, Because someone said to those people that it was the greatest movie of all time. I on the other hand found it so boring. So completely overrated and just simply SO boring that i hope never to see the other episodes of this movie. I in fact pray my children in the future will never have to see such a bad movie. Im sorry to say these thing and sound like a hater. But i really just do not agree with you and other who find this movie so magnificent. But i found this movie very bad apart from ill make him an offer he cant refuse story. Other than that i found this movie a mistake."
8,"Godfather, the best movie of all times? Gimme a break...","Godfather the best movie of all times, and the only movie worth a 9/10, and Godfather 2 the third best movie?? Come on..., the Godfather series has its moments and especially the first one is not a bad movie at all. But, IMHO, almost all the other major movies about Mafia (especially ""Goodfellas"" & ""Once Upon a Time in America"") are, more interesting and better art too than the bombastic Godfather series. I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards.

And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much: it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the ""wild & free"" life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography ""Run, baby, run"" because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that. Sadly, it is often the same with movies. You think Quentin Tarantino is so popular among the masses because of his artistic merits? You think wrong."
9,No Where Near The Master Piece As Shown,I like to say that this movie was so fine that the violence and sexual references spoiled it all and the message was so deep. The Godfather is by far one of those movies that adults say even 16 year old kids like me can't watch it because it's very hard for even them to watch. It was rated R originally but they changed it to MA probably they think it's too offensive for viewers to say it's a masterpiece and doesn't deserve to be so highly rated. The Shawshank Redemption in the other hand was a perfect movie with the deepest message known as hope and was surprisingly rated MA in Australia and on the TV rating is Rated M which is more fair enough. The Godfather was just horrible and I really thought that Part 2 would be better but it really isn't and for once in my life I'm going to confirm that The Godfather shouldn't deserve to be known as a masterpiece
8,not the best movie of all time,"I personally believe that Godfater is one the most boring but ""Famous"" movies of all time.The moment anybody hears the word GODFATHER they """"want"""" to believe that this is the best movie of all but in the real sense it is far from being great.People tell that AL Pacino got known by this movie but all he ever did was keep his mouth shut except for a few scenes unlike his other movies like Scarface,Heat,Devil's Advocate,Dog Day Afternoon etc.Even the """"great Marlon Brando"""" did not have much role in it.The entire movie is filled with conversation and nothing else.If there was A man in this entire planet who never saw or even heard anything about any movie,and you show him ""The Godfather"",I bet that he would probably go to sleep within the first 10 minutes.We the people of todays generation are made to believe that this is the best movie of all time by the media and other people.Honestly the only reason i saw this movie was to find out what the hell was there in it that is receiving so much appreciation.Guys who have not seen this movie might also be thinking the same that this movie is the best bit in reality,it is not.This movie is a very long piece of ****"
8,Not the best ever,"I personally believe that this movie is overrated. I don't really even believe it is the best work from a Coppola (I personally believe ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Lost in Translation"" are much better movies), but it still is entertaining to watch. It has notable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (perhaps the only Pacino performance other than ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" where he doesn't scream his eyes out), and the film also has a very nice screenplay, but the movie isn't as entertaining or extraordinary as other frontrunners like ""Casablanca"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Maybe because this movie has been marred by so many rip-offs or clones, that the magic of the film has disappeared. The film just no longer feels ageless, and that's too bad."
10,A true masterpiece,Loved every second of it. Deep and needs attention to understand it. Reason why i liked it so much.
10,A Timeless Masterpiece: The Godfather,"The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Released in 1972, this iconic film has earned its reputation as one of the finest works in the history of cinema. Its compelling narrative, unforgettable characters, and impeccable craftsmanship make it an enduring classic.

Plot and Storyline: ""The Godfather"" delves into the complex world of the Corleone family, a formidable Italian-American Mafia dynasty led by the enigmatic Vito Corleone, portrayed brilliantly by Marlon Brando.

Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, the screenplay weaves a rich and multi-dimensional narrative that keeps viewers engaged throughout.

Characters and Performances: The film boasts an ensemble cast that delivers iconic performances. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is a masterclass in acting, and Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a formidable mafia boss as Michael Corleone is truly mesmerizing. The supporting cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, offer outstanding performances that add depth and authenticity to the characters.

Direction and Cinematography: Francis Ford Coppola's direction is a work of art in itself. His meticulous attention to detail, use of symbolism, and ability to create tension through silence are unparalleled. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is equally remarkable, with its dark, moody visuals setting the perfect tone for the film's dark and complex narrative.

Music and Score: Nino Rota's haunting score is unforgettable and enhances the film's atmosphere. The ""Godfather Theme"" has become an instantly recognizable piece of cinematic music that perfectly complements the film's gravitas.

Its exploration of power, family, and morality continues to resonate with audiences today, and its cultural influence extends well beyond the movie theater."
2,Over-rated snoozefest.,"I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, despite being quite aware of the many high-praises that this film had garnered over the years. I paid very-close attention and I watched the whole movie very carefully.

What did I see ?

Nothing special,that's for sure! The movie is very slow-moving.

The characters are silly,laughable clichés. The plot is predictable with a few unlikely twists. Some of the movie is unintentionally funny because it is so unbelievably weak in spots.

I kept waiting (in vain) for the pace of the movie to pick-up,or for something to happen that seemed even somewhat realistic. (Which never occurred).

When the movie finally ended,I was sorely disappointed and I wondered what was supposed to be so special about the whole thing. I'm still wondering why this movie is so highly rated. I honestly can only conclude that so-many people claim to like this movie because that is what they are expected to say and it is easier to go along with the crowd than to just be objective and honest. This movie is not special,it is not good,and in fact it isn't even mediocre. It is a truly forgetable snoozefest,a C- or D level film. That is my honest opinion,and I cannot be the only person to come to this obvious conclusion...even if I am one of the few that has the nerve to say it. 2/10,an overrated snoozefest and a complete waste of time. Skip it."
9,The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.,"Of all time. Of. All. Time. To have an accolade such as that isn't just impressive, it's near impossible (especially by today's standards). The consequences of acquiring such an achievement results in expectations being sky high, not just for first time watches but for multiple viewings as well. For me, it's a first time watch...the ultimate question is: Is this really the greatest film ever made? I cannot answer that, not after one viewing. It's an incredible behemoth at 177 minutes. Now I always say ""honesty is the best policy"", so with that in mind...my one and only criticism, the pace stagnates occasionally. The plot sometimes comes across as monotonous, whether that be due to the film's length or the actual substance. However, before you destroy my opinion and cast me out for lack of credibility, The Godfather is truly a phenomenal film. It's aged incredibly well since 1972 and is one of the few films I've seen where every scene is packed with rich characters, traditionalism and sharp dialogue. It's meticulously crafted. Coppola's direction was, dare I say, perfect. Nothing seemed out of place, although there was one fight scene where the punches were so far away from the actor's...but that's an absurdly minor gripe. Marlon Brando was palpable. He exhumed power, control and vulnerability. A patriarchal figure in a family struggling to stay in authoritative control in a time of corruption, deceit and betrayal. The screenplay beautifully captures the balance of the crime world and a hearty Sicilian family where traditional values are considered in both of these different environments. To most people, family is everything. The film really conveys that in a sensitive yet compelling way. Pacino was fantastic. Rita's score was utterly memorable. Puzo's screenplay was full of life. It's so much to take in one viewing that I'm sure my rating will change in the future. But I cannot deny there were moments when I looked at my watch. Some say the sequel is superior, so I have high hopes."
10,The Most Outstanding Achievement In Motion Picture of The 20th Century,"Steven Spielberg once said he considered retiring after watching The Godfather. Stanley Kubrick admitted The Godfather may very well be the greatest movie ever made and without a doubt has the best cast. If two of the greatest directors of all time had claimed such statement, what more needs to be said about this masterpiece, really? By now, it's already a stuff of legend. Countless lists and people have rated this as the finest motion picture to ever grace the silver screen. The genre and cinema itself have been heavily influenced by the contents in the movie, and even real-life mafias mimicked how Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in what I consider to be the most splendid acting job done by any actor or actress in any movie ever, carried himself. When did you ever hear something like that happened? If there was ever any? I doubt Francis Ford Coppola himself would have thought his first big directorial job would have given birth to an enduring legacy THIS big. Sure, he had Marlon Brando in his pocket, complete with Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, and Robert Duvall as future stars just to name a few, which must have been exciting for a young director for that time. But I still doubt Coppola would have known he was directing the greatest motion picture of the 20th century even once during the entire 62 days of shooting, even when he, the entire casts, and the entire crews gave it their all for those 62 days. But that magic was there. And it is now known throughout the world as The Godfather.

I think the story is rather famous now, but I'll say it anyway. It tells the story of an organized crime family after the World War II was over. Spanning over 10 years, the movie was a journey of the youngest son (played brilliantly by the legendary Al Pacino) transformed from a war hero not wanting to have anything to do with his family's business to become the next head of an organized crime dynasty.

It featured brilliant performances from every single person involved, especially the mythical Marlon Brando. Every scene he was in, no way you didn't have your eyes on him. Even when he wasn't around, you would still feel his presence and power. His character, to me at least, made this movie. No one could play him as grand as Marlon Brando did.

On technical aspect, this movie is flawless. Coppola's directing really captured the quintessence of every character in the movie. The dark photography added to the whole mystique of every scene in this movie. And the last but definitely not the least, the score is magical.

What else is there need to be said about this masterpiece? Only a few movie can be called perfection, The Godfather is a prime example of it. Everything in this movie is so unbelievably perfect it is almost unreal. How come something became this great is hard to decipher. This timeless classic is a definite must see for anyone. And among many movies made in the 20th century I have seen, this is the best of the best. The finest of the finest. Maybe several movies can come close, but I don't think anything can top this. I firmly believe The Godfather is without a doubt the most brilliant motion picture of the 20th century."
10,"A famously amazing film, and rightly so.","The Godfather is a work of genius and pure commitment on all fronts. Francis Ford Coppola's direction, and the editing, all builds up that slow intensity and sophistication that comes with this movie. Marlon Brando is amazing, and Al Pacino too, with his cold rage. You can feel the tension build when you know someone is about to be killed, and you also understand the sense of comraderie and close relationships within the mafia. It never fails to keep your interest, and the plot can twist at any moment. Not to mention, the dialogue and scenes are expertly crafted and the payoff is incredibly satisfying. Although hard to follow at times, the Godfather is a must-watch."
10,Legendary film,"A truly legendary film, although some people (in particular Russian viewers) do not consider the film as such. But still, the fact remains, because in this work there is the subtlest psychology and philosophy that go beyond the film itself, unlike various modern works, where the whole ..."
10,Super,"Old cult cinema. Great movie. Some movies you just have to see. Although the production is young, it really keeps you in suspense. You could do it with little effort cool movie in the seventies. It is known that there were so many sound effects and light but there feel the atmosphere of American cinema. May passion for cinema is one of the two because the first is a medical emergency, major who is studying for two years. I hope that in the future I will be able to help people and work in a close-knit team of people who have a passion for what they do. Certainly, however, will not give up keeping abreast of what goes on the screen. Only in recent films miss the message. The focus is to contract the most popular actor. Increasingly, however, are valued directors who are not afraid to make difficult subjects, it can sometimes controversial. I like the cinema."
10,the best,This movie really made a lot of difference I am loving it
10,One of the greatest films ever made,The Godfather is the one of the greatest films ever made. I've watch it so many times.
10,Awesome movie,"The Godfather"" stands as an iconic masterpiece in cinematic history, seamlessly weaving together elements of crime, family, loyalty, and power. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, this film adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel captures the essence of the American Mafia with unparalleled finesse.

Set in post-World War II America, ""The Godfather"" delves deep into the Corleone crime family's intricate dynamics. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family, is nothing short of legendary. Brando's nuanced performance brings depth to the character, showcasing the duality of a loving father and a ruthless mob boss."
7,The Godfather - universally acclaimed mobster soap opera,"There's no sense fighting the general consensus about this uber-classic. I refuse to use words like ""overrated"" and you probably don't care that I don't care for mob movies, because I consider thugs in expensive suits no more heroic than thugs without expensive suits.

Having said that, I was amazed with Pacino (stunning performance) and particularly Coppola, who was such an amazingly slick and accomplished director at such a young age. His use of light and music is superb. His framing makes the atmosphere intimate and believable. This movie is laced with iconic scenes, has great pacing and is blessed with great production values throughout. Wow.

The bad: Brando is a joke (as he often is). Also, I didn't think the storytelling was particularly tight; you could find more holes in the plot than in Sonny C's body. Again, I find it hard to root for any racketeering don, and I'm bewildered by the world's continued fascination with mafia types. But a very good movie it is."
1,I don't think i could write a title.....,"The Godfather... 3 Oscars... NONONONONONONONONO!!!!!!! This film (And its others) Is THE worst piece of rubbish i have ever endured!

I feel that it was an insult to my backside who was forced to grow carbuncles under the weight of such mafia slush. the acting is terrible, the premise is horrible and the time is awful.

They made more than 1? yes. were any of them good (and i'm not biased, i always watch things till the end to get a full view... i even watched the others although i hated it) no.. all awful, all too long, need i say more?

My view -10/10"
10,love it,"Great story, great movie, love every bits of the movie.

Marlon Brando is a great character.

Personally, i think this is the best part of 3 parts.

Storyline is very well written, slow when it need to be slow and fast when it got to be fast."
10,as a woman or learn a lot,"Do not do the things of the guilty heart, introverted, stable, brave, love family, not selfish, stand up for the people who love, although it is a man must see the film, but as a woman or learn a lot"
10,"The Greatest, No Matter What Year","Words cannot describe the perfection that is The Godfather. It captivates you from the moment the wonderful and haunting score starts to play to the moment that the credits roll. Coupled with a wonderful script by the author of the book himself and the perfect cast of characters, this movie cannot be called anything other than perfect.

It is a story of a Mafia crime family and how this identity affects those within it. It is a haunting story of love, betrayal, hatred, fear, and, most of all, family. As you watch this movie, you will find yourself wishing that this family was a reality, something you could see and talk to and join. The greatness of the Corleone family is summed up in Don Corleone's line, ""I refuse to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots.""

Marlon Brando's performance stands out above all the others; his portrayal as Don of the Corleone Mafia family is so convincing that if you see him in his other films, you will find it hard to be convinced by his other characters. Al Pacino provided a wonderful portrayal of a family member outcast that is unwittingly drawn into the whirlwind of his family's business. Other performances by James Caan and Robert Duvall and all the others completed the greatest cast assembly in movie history.

Though followed by two sequels, The Godfather was undoubtedly the greatest among them as well as being the greatest movie ever created. Citizen Kane may be regarded as higher, but it is the most important movie of all time, not the greatest; The Godfather holds that title. It is a pity that this movie won only three Academy Awards (Picture, Actor, Adapted Screenplay); it was right that it won Best Picture, but it was jipped out of all the other awards it should have won, especially Best Director, by Cabaret, a self-indulgent piece of crap with Liza Minneli as the star. But no matter what awards it won, The Godfather will stand the test of time and will forever be recognized as the greatest film ever created.

100 out of 5"
10,Eighth wonder of the world,"The godfather movie might be over 50 years old, however I'd imagine since I am 25 years old that it was as esteemed then as it is now.

One of many amazing things about this movie is the cast. I quickly became as invested in the supporting cast as I did in the main cast. It's a rare thing which should not be overlooked since most movies rely on 2-3 people to carry the movie. In this movie you feel that everyone contribute - a masterstroke.

As an avid book reader of books that have been adapted into movies, Coppola really captures the essential point of the saga: Loyalty and family. This binds and permeates every action in the movie. Nothing feels as a suprise, everything is intertwined and natural as a cause of loyalty and family.

I have seen it 12 times now, (first time this year) and I try for each new time I watch it to find deficiencies - which starts to feel like a waist of time - there are none. It's honest, it's real and it's still the benchmark of storytelling that every movie since and before aspire/aspired to reach."
10,One of the best movies in my life !,"It's one of the best movies I've ever watched, The cast, the story, the characters, the music, and the color pallets, everything was perfect, and felt so real. This movie will remain always, the best gangster piece in cinema history."
10,An epic for all time,"I could watch this movie again and again. Marlon Brando is spectacular, and you envy and pity the Corleones at the same time. They seem to have such a strong sense of loyalty and family, yet they are constantly watching their backs and wondering when their time is up. The struggle of the Corleones to eventually become legitimate is dramatic and sad, but beautifully portrayed."
7,Awesome,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece for several reasons. The film boasts an exceptional screenplay, captivating storytelling, and brilliant performances from the ensemble cast. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, and Al Pacino's performance as Michael is equally iconic.

The movie is renowned for its nuanced characters, intricate plot, and its ability to explore the moral complexities of the Mafia world. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is remarkable, with its use of dark and moody lighting adding to the film's overall atmosphere.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction and the collaboration with Mario Puzo on the screenplay resulted in a film that transcends its genre, offering a profound exploration of power dynamics and the impact of choices on individuals and their families.

""The Godfather"" has left an indelible mark on cinema and remains a cultural touchstone. It's a film that continues to be studied, appreciated, and celebrated for its cinematic brilliance and storytelling prowess. Whether you're a fan of crime dramas or simply appreciate exceptional filmmaking, ""The Godfather"" is a must-watch."
1,This movie was not at all entertaining...,"When I was in high school I took a cinema class and the teacher showed the Godfather I & II. I personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring. There was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way. If you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you.

I don't mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining. When I was forced to watch the Godfather I & II in my cinema class I wish I had a pillow to put on my desk so that I could sleep.

If you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the Godfather on and you will be asleep in no time."
10,Just watch this.,"Do yourself a favour, and just watch it for gods sake."
10,The Greatest Movie Of All Time,"I can remember the first time I saw this movie, it just totally blew me away. There has never been a better movie and there never will be a better one and I'll tell you why. Everything came together for this movie, the acting, music, screenplay, setting, the characters and the story. It did something rare it brought crime and family together in an almost mythical way. Also it brought Marlon Brando (The Godfather) as a passing Don to a new generation (Al Pacino), in essence the transfer of power was being passed from one generation to another Brando to Pacino, and in the second movie it was Brando to DeNiro. Aside from their great performances, James Caan and Robert Duvall were flawless. James Caan turns in the performance of a lifetime as Sonny Corelone, and Duvall is flawless as Consilgere to the Don. If you have read the book you know will know why it was perfectly transfered from the book to the big screen. Their will never be legends such as Brando and Pacino ever again, they became the characters, they weren't acting, THEY BECAME the characters. I still get chills down my spine at the end of the movie when that the door closes and the transfer of power is complete from Father to Son. Don Corleone to Michael. It is unforgettable, and the legend grows with every viewing of the film."
10,The best,"Best movie ever made!This movie describes the real life, what was happening in those years. I like this movie because it shows, how real man were, how to be a real man. Nowdays you don't see this that much, the people don't honor the elders and there are many more snitches than it used to be. The respect for people is gone. Everybody thinks that they are tough, but when it comes to real situation they turn their backs around and walk away. In this movie you see the opposite. You see how everything was handeld and you know what it was the good way I think. The life is tough and if we don't face it that way like in this movie we cant survive. I watched this movie like 100 times and I can watch it like 100 times more."
10,What a movie,"Just brilliant to be called a movie, truly a masterpiece"
10,My honest review of the Godfather !!!,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as a cornerstone of American filmmaking. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this epic tale of the Corleone crime family is both gripping and profound. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation from Michael Corleone to a ruthless mafia boss are outstanding.

The film's storytelling is impeccable, blending intense drama with rich character development. The cinematography and score are equally brilliant, enhancing the film's dark, atmospheric tone. The Godfather explores themes of power, loyalty, and family with unmatched depth and sophistication.

In just under three hours, The Godfather delivers a powerful, unforgettable experience that has left an indelible mark on cinema. It's a must-see for any film enthusiast."
6,The Godfather,"This is a good film. It is well directed and well acted. The story is engaging, and the sets flawlessly reflect the time period. And yet... it is only a *good* movie. I know that I will probably be hated for saying this, but ""The Godfather"" really doesn't seem like a masterpiece. Although it is certainly one of the most influential films of its time, I can't help but feel that it is a little overrated. Perhaps my tastes just aren't the same as everyone else's. And then again... maybe I am right, and a film doesn't have to be ""perfect"" to be memorable. ""The Godfather"" is worth watching... once... mainly because it has become such an integral part of our culture. It set the stage for epic crime dramas, and that alone is impressive. But... is it really so much better than other films? The first doesn't always have to be the best. ""The Godfather"" lays down a very solid foundation for future cinema, much as ""Gone With the WInd"" did, way back in the day (don't even get me started on that one). It is by no means perfect, but it is, like I said, worth watching."
1,"It's good, but...","This is a very good movie that is very overrated. I agree that it belongs on the top 250 list, bust its rank as the best movie of all time is slightly overblown. It is a movie thats popularity has stemmed from the American fascination with the the Mafia."

10,Godfather Review,"This is a movie beeing exemplified by current movies,i don't wanna talk about this movie's light adjustments and small details like that i know big things happen when little things come together but this movie's legendary is not about something like that,The answer about why this movie is a legend, STORY. This movie's story so slow but it is also absorbing people to story and thats the reason why i just want to talk about story.Im going to start from Micheal's(IM NOT TALKING ABOUT SCOFIELD MR PRISON BREAKER :] ) character change is magnificent its overlap some theory about people character changing, some people thinks (like thomas shelby MR WHO GOT NEARLY ...... EVERYTHING XD) no body never can change but NOPE everybody can change if you create the true possibilities to make him necessitate to be a different human that people will be changed and i think this movie accepting this idea, Corleone's gunshot injury and pressure in family forced Micheal to change his self and also Sunny's bully chracter and his tragic and dramic death supporting so much to story.And the most crucial thing from godfather finding who is traitor and what corleone's using for the find traitor it was ingenious.And now we're going to best scene for me the scene micheal kills sollozzo and mccluskey that was damnnn stressfull is he gonna find the gun is he can shoot them and Al pacino's gestures acting in that second he was making us feel that stress.The second one is its not personaly scene it was showing us hierarchy in family and it was reflecting that hierarchy damn brilliant Sunny's underestimate to Micheal, Micheal's claim that he can do it that was the second best for me. I dont wanna talk about godfather's Roma philosophy and submissions also if you dont get them i suggest you to learn Roma history and watch that movie again if i going to talk more about godfather i can do it whole night whole week but i cant this was my a little bit funny and little bit interesting review about godfather."
10,Awesome Film,"I did not become a fan of this film until the early 90s when I saw it on video tape. This film is definitely a masterpiece. Its a film I dont get tired of watching. The characters are compelling and the actors are superb. Definitely one of my five favorite films, along with its incredible sequel"
10,God Father,All I want to say is that:God Father is always god father.
10,A masterpiece,I am teenager and I watched this movie to being honest i not that amuse with it but after gather up some knowledge I watched it and then I appreciate it found lot more meaning and perfection in this movie.i have to watch it many to totally appreciate it.
10,"The greatest American film ever, period.","For many years ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was my favorite movie. And, as a serious student of cinema I very much admire ""Citizen Kane."" But, at some point during the 1970's ""The Godfather"" overtook all others, and I doubt seriously whether we will see the likes of this magnificent film again in my lifetime.

In ""The Godfather"" all the elements of picture-making come together in splendid perfection. The script, actors, cinematography, production values, music, effects, and direction are all superb and seamless. Sex, violence, loyalty, betrayal, revenge, love, hate, and even comedy--all find a home here. It is a remarkable achievement, equaled only by ""The Godfather--Part II."""
7,Ashley Aonyea Says...,"Well... if I had to choose the ultimate Gangsta movie to review this tops the list! Action..Crime..Suspense to name a few are all included in this flick, and it does not disappoint. This is your go-to movie when you want to feel like the ultimate CRIME BOSS (minus the jail time)Definitely one of Francis Ford Coppola best films. He really captures the essence of the lifestyle these Good fellas have. In retrospect he breathes life into the characters that already hold enough personality for an entire football team. If I had to rate it between one and ten I would say a seven, only because the movie is so damn dark you feel like the director shot the entire flick at night!"
1,Why?,"It was the most boring film I've ever forced myself to endure in my entire life! I tried to tell myself it was good to be a part of the hype surrounding it but I just couldn't justify ever telling another soul to watch this movie. The boringness combined with characters that, I for one could not tell the difference between, being so unremarkable led for the biggest snooze fest of a film viewing ever! I don't understand the hype and personally it annoys me that this takes the #2 spot away from other incredible films!"
9,Greatest Movie Ever Seen,"I Think The People Know The Godfather and don Vito Corleone and His Family are more than people Go cinemas godfather trilogy is complex of excellent directing acting writing charactering costume design somebody likes Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption or any Movie But I am Sure All of Them agree with me godfather is Greatest Picture of Cinema for Example Don Vito Corleone is symbol of gangsters no Al Capone or Acting of Al Pacino the Great he change the acting for all of history but a great question is why ford Coppola never back to golden age after apocalypse now. if he repeat masterpieces I am sure he became great director of all time. see the godfather and enjoy it because it is not for 1970s it's a movie for all time"
10,Amazing,This movie is a Master Peace. Suspense action drama murder money power loyalty respect fear ambition revenge rage I mean what more can you ask for in a movie . All Star cast . Need I say more
9,Showed me how to organize my empire,"The godfather was my first introduction to the organization and rules behind the Italian mafia. Only after that I started to see how this was crucial to success of a criminal organization. Sculpted like and inspired by the Roman empire is a method that really worked. It changed somewhat during the years, but my empire is still run in a similar way.

Great movie without too much overacting. Some of the shots even look too much like it was shot in an amateuristic live situation. Part 2 & 3 were a real addition and the trilogy is definitely worth watching.

The only drawback: They made it seem that crime doesn't pay. Nobody was happy and everybody died. Greatly exaggerated!"

10,Still the benchmark for character driven films,"Legendary performances that remain some of the best ever given from an all-star cast, iconic cinematography, and some of the absolute best, most human character development that ever made its way to a screen.

Adaptations aren't usually this faithful or brilliant. This movie and the book it's based on influenced society for a reason, they are landmark achievements. Very, very few movies feature characters that bring so much to the screen, and the study of power in The Godfather series will forever be etched in history for its brilliance.

The 1970s was the decade for films as art, more than any other decade. It's a shame that the modern era is dominated by the likes of The Avengers."
7,acting masterclass. classic film.,"The Godfather, is most people's favourite film, and arguably one of the best films ever made. However, I only saw it in 2015 for the first time, so my impression of it is different to those who have grown up with it. I thought the film was brilliant, some really powerful performances and many huge stars now in their youth; Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and James Caan. The film has not aged well, but is still gripping and interesting, and in place visceral and emotional. James Caan as the protective older brother was memorable but of course Marlon Brando stands out as the much parodied, copied and admired main character to whom everyone defers. As I said, the film has dated and his prosthesis padded mouth doesn't look so good as I imagine it did when first released, and the make-up on Pacino was also distractingly bad. The film jumps forward in time quickly, and doesn't explain anything, as films are wont to do more latterly, which is refreshing, and the plot is complex enough to require full attention, and whilst it's not a laugh a minute ""enjoyable"" film, or about subject matter which is pleasant, is bloody and violent, it is worth watching and certainly one of cinema's most brilliant masterpieces. I think my impression of this film is lessened by the fact that I didn't see it for until now so didn't have the loyalty to ""The Family"" that longtime watchers have, when they've grown up with it, but it was amazing to finally see the original from which many other films have taken their cue or inspiration."
2,Zzzzzzzz,"I tried to watch this film a couple of years ago... since it is so hyped, and I'd never seen it before, I thought it would be worth seeing.

I was wrong.

Seriously, I found it hard to stay awake during the film - and eventually had to give up just over halfway through, and find something more interesting to do. This is a shame, because quite possibly it might have got more interesting towards the end - but it did not retain my interest for long enough. I did see the infamous scene with the horse's head, expecting it to be some cinematic masterpiece, but... no, even that was an anticlimax."
10,Osam Movie,"Yes this movie is so great. This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."
10,Coppola's epic masterpiece,"One of the greatest films ever made! It stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Rober Duvall and James Caan as members of a powerful mob family. Brando is unforgettable and Pacino's transformation from responsible son to menacing thug is eerily effective. Some unforgettable scenes include the shooting in a deli. This is the greatest crime film ever made and stands as a great ""male"" soap opera. Don't forget about the Godfather Part 2! You'll miss more of the greatness! (The Godfather Part 3 is good, but poor by comparison)"
9,"The Godfather, Amazing movie","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay written by Mario Puzo and Coppola. The movie is based on Italian-American Mafia member Joseph ""Joe"" Bonanza's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. It follows the story of Michael Corleone, a mafia kingpin who attempts to legitimize his criminal enterprise and keep his family from being torn apart.

The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, who becomes involved in organized crime at the age of twenty, after being forced into it by his father Don Vito Corleone to protect their family from a rival gang and corrupt police officers. Michael is put under."

10,Gangster Masterpiece,"The perfect gangstser movie, so original and creative, great acting great dialogues, never boring. 10/10"
1,Groundhog Day >>>>>>>>>> The Godfather,"Everyone's saying this overrated film is one of ""the greatest films of all time"" - NOPE! I'm saying it's Groundhog Day!

WHY?? Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching ""the Godfather"", I feel, ""No, I don't want to do or watch these things"".

Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT ""flawless"" - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you!

I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a ""masterpiece"", and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the ""Godfather"" series should be given instead towards ""Groundhog Day""; all the awards given to the ""Godfather"" series should be instead towards ""Groundhog Day"". It's THAT good! Please check it out!

And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters.

Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be.

Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all.

But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up.

2/10

PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see."
8,Well done,"The Godfather, an electrifyingly well made film. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, just naming the heavy hitting stars. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia family living in New York. The Don's main source of income is gambling and protection. Another head of another mafia family (Sollozzo) wants to sell drugs to gain profit, Don Vito hates the idea of selling drugs on the market, so an attempt to take his life is made. One special son of the Godfather is brought to light when this event happens. In the film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the films gives the viewer a feeling of sympathy for a mob family, when in reality, a person does not usually take the side of a mob family, doing things against the law to make profit. A couple of the ways this happens is the fact that it's felt that Don Corleone is trying to do the `right' and `honest' way to make his profit by not selling drugs. Also, by the death and injury of many family members, the film brings a feeling of understanding, sympathy, and compassion towards the Corleone's. The film includes numerous scenes of murder, often in an offensive amount. Some scene feature hideous lights jobs, to the point of not seeing the character's faces, or telling what is happening. Although very monotonous, the music and soundtrack the movie was well done, and really changed the feel of individual scenes. There was an excellent job of doing crescendos and making diminuendos of certain scene to build suspense, or foreshadowing an event. Overall, the acting was superb, great casting, very well conceived and structured plot. I give The Godfather 8.5 out of ten."
10,My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms,", I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing.

There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head.

My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit."
9,Gangster film,"Male growth movie, telling the story of a child becoming a gangster boss, this is the best gangster crime movie I have ever seen, which is very shocking."
10,Classic,"Beautiful movie that will last throughout time.

The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.

The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons."
8,its worth the hype,"Its definitely worth all the hype, i would suggest if you have a bucket list of movies, watch it. I watched it maybe about 5 years ago, with my friends, there is a reason why its been parodied to death and paid homage so many times over the years."
9,Awesome,"This movie is awesome. I've been in love with this movie (and the other two) since I was a young girl. And I think partly due to this movie, I love movies with violence. Not that this movie has tons of violence in it, but it has enough to leave a lasting impression on a young person. It has been said many, many times before that ""all I need to know, I learned from the Godfather"" and truer words have never been spoken. At it's core, The Godfather is about family values. This movie isn't only about the mob or drugs or any of those things that's just one part of it, but ultimately, it's about family. Despite not exactly having anything in common with the characters, this movie has left a mark on my life that could not have been placed there by another movie. This is THE best movie. Great job Puzo & Coppola. RIP Mr. Puzo."
9,An overrated masterpiece,"While certainly a little overrated, the Godfather still holds up as an amazing movie with some of the most iconic characters, moments and lines in all of film. The story is a crime drama that follows the leader of a massive crime family passing the torch to his youngest and most reluctant son. The genius and appeal of the story not only lies in its well executed structure and masterful dialogue, but also the realism and accuracy with which it tells a story about the mafia. However the film would be nothing without the characters and the actors that play them. Al Pachino is indeed fantastic in the film, and Robert Duvall is also good, but the film belongs to Marlon Brando. His performance as Vito Corleone is legendary and the character has become one of the best and most loved in all of fiction. This is an absolute masterpiece, though not quite the greatest of all time, and will remain a huge part of film history forever."
7,This Movie Is Simply Perfect,"Everything from the acting, directing, and writing of this movie is perfect. There isn't a single bad line of dialogue. There isn't a single poor shot in the movie. I could go on and on about it but this movie really is perfect. The story is classic and simple, leaving it easy and fun to follow. Every scene moves the plot forward to the next scene. There are so many great moments in the movie that're still studied by young filmmakers today. The only weak point of the movie is the character arc of Michael Corleone, while he is a well written character I feel like it's nothing we haven't seen before in a film. Overall there isn't a single thing wrong with the film and it's one of the best movies ever made."
1,If you haven't seen The Godfather before,", the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
10,Best ever made,"I got to watch the fourth bonus DVD celebrating 25 years of the first movie, after watching the behind scenes and the work done by the film crew, I cant agree more that his movie is the best ever made. I watched the fourth DVD which includes the Godfather Notebook, it's how Coppola wrote the script for the movie on the exact papers of the original novel by cutting every single page of the novel and paste it in an A4 frame that will make the footnote bugger so he can write the script on each page of the original novel. Some of the greatest scenes were Coppola first hearing the sound track by Nino Rota on a cassette tape, and Robert De Niro playing the role of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone during the casting for the role. It's really a very good DVD and it shows how a great movie was done."
10,god father,All I want to say is that : The God Father is always god father.
9,The godfather,A story about how a good child becomes the boss. Marlon is fascinating
10,Well this is called a film.......but i hope,"The Godfather is a good script by Mario Puzo to be cast into a motion picture but its Francis Ford Coppola who really drilled the task. This movie marks a landmark in the history of films.

Just to be short, i must say that such kind of cinematography, execution, acting, and atmosphere is unique in these series that is rare to be found anywhere else. A great story and amazingly huge drama sets off the viewer out of his movie making knowledge and put him into a different world of gangsters and revenge but still there is something that shines for comfort in their families.

So well this is called a film.......but i hope such great films instead of showing what they showed, should show others love and life. I am saying this just because there is a huge amount of potential in such movies to do what they want to do."
10,Best of the best,"yes it was produced back at 1972 but till now it's the best movie for all time.what an epic,once you open this film you will take a trip to the mafia world and you will be a member of the corleone family.I felt that Coppola was drawing this movie with his hands,he was like a magician playing with his tools.brando gives us the best performance maybe in cinematic history.i can't believe that this was the first movie(worldwide production)for Al Pacino,he was iconic,the way his character alters alongside the film was nearly impossible to be performed by anyone and be convincing but Pacino did it like he was born for it.Duvall was so smooth and Caan was so serious that you feel they are those characters at real life too.every single actor deserved an Oscar for there performances in this masterpiece.Mario puzo created a perfect novel and then made an even better screenplay.Coppola handled this film like he was waiting and preparing for it his whole life."
9,Awesome - The cinematography and direction,"The cinematography and direction, needless to say, are incredible. There are moments where the camera direction could improve, but it isn't too distracting. The first scene, the wedding scene, practically is a showcase of how well done the actors' directions are. There are a lot of subtleties, the actors and actresses look so natural, they don't look tense at all, which helps make the scene feels more real. The color scheme also helps to give an ol' time vibe. An easy 9.6. Halfway through the movie, though, I started asking myself, ""Isn't the movie essentially over?"" The major conflicts are resolved, so what will I be spending another 80+ minutes for? And in a sense, I'd probably be better off stopping there. There are a lot of good moments, one of my favorite being when Vito finds out about his son's death. His grief is ironic, a jab to what he told John about crying. The scene on marital abuse portrays the misogynistic reality, still prevalent today. Connie's anger isn't a rational action, but an understandable byproduct of continual abuse (and a narcissistic relationship). But all these come with a bitter cost: less screentime on several supposedly important characters. Why do I even want to root for Apollonia if she's portrayed as a dumbhead with no relatable qualities? A lot of characters started becoming harder to root for. Worse off? The subtleties in the first half (e.g. Children playing in the street) lack so much variety they are practically reusable scenes. I know they're practically just supporting characters, but can we at least be more creative than putting the same laugh track over and over for doing random kid things? By the end of the movie I just have this bubbling rage for Kay and Mike's relationship. And I think a 9 would have been overly generous for its second half, so I'd gladly give it an 8.9/10 if possible."
7,And Don is naked!,"Well, how else can you explain the fact that this creation is in 13th place in the TOP 250 films, and on IMDB in general in second place? Only the desire of people to conform to public opinion, to admire everything that many people admire, and thereby allegedly bring themselves closer to supposedly elitist art. This happens not only with movies, I note, but also with musical works. How often can you come across another 'Mozart - Requiem for a Dream' bullshit on some website, when in fact (I think you know this too) the author of this melody is Clint Mussel."
1,Godfather,this movie was horrible i don't understand how this is a good movie. Al Pacino's worst movie. Marlon Brando was horrible. So many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned. Francis ford Coppola is a bad director. Goerge Lucas is the best director ever. I'd give this movie a 3.0 on a 10 scale. The best movie in the world is easily material girls. Hilary duff is so hot in that movie. The screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad. A movie you should see is Material girls the best movie ever. Good directing screenplay and defiantly acting. Another good movie was From Justin to Kelly. Justin is hot in his swimsuit but Kelly needs to lose pounds.
10,The Greatest Movie of all Time <3,"The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie."

10,One of the finest American films ever made,"'The Godfather' is perhaps the greatest American film ever made.

The cast is absolutely second to none: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Talia Shire, and Diane Keaton are all very convincing in their roles as members of this crime family.

My favorite character in this film is Michael Corleone. In the beginning, Michael's intentions are honorable, and he does not intend to become involved ""in the family business"". However, the viewer soon learns that the apple does not fall far from the tree, and Michael inevitably follows in his father's footsteps, and becomes even more ruthless than his father, Don Vito Corleone.

This film vividly portrays the ruthlessness of criminal organizations, and the price participants pay for involvement in a business that plays by no rules and never forgives betrayal. Life is certainly not sacred with these people, and the ends justify the means in accordance with 'The family business'.

'The Godfather' is a timeless classic that you will enjoy watching repeatedly."
10,"Gold Standard of Crime, Murder and Mafia in Film","Impeccable cast, impeccable directing and impeccable story. Godfather is the only film that you can be locked in a cell months on end with it in front of you and it wouldn't be considered torture."
6,My Personal Review,This movie really express the time of maffia organization and how the familly stick together.
10,Truly a Classic.....,"""The Godfather"" is indeed a re-defining moment in the long and elegant history of the Celluloid.It includes every true aspect of a true movie. The Godfather will appeal to any viewer with its brilliant treatment and way of storytelling.Francis Ford Coppola tells the story of the Italian crime families that ruled vice in the ""Post-Depression"" America.The spotlight is thrown on the rise of the Corleone family and its head,Don Vito Corleone(portrayed by Marlon Brando).The fierce fights among the other families for ultimate glory..and for survival is captured with stunning reality by Coppola.A 'young' Al Pacino has excelled as the aging Don's faithful son who has ""his own plans"" for his life but later takes up the family's responsibilities due to his fight with Fate.Coppola remains true to the title as he pictures the heavenly rise of a man who fought with his own conscience to achieve that ultimate seat of The Godfather of Vice.

I urge each and every film-lover to see this movie, as it is one of the most important landmarks in movie making.I do not intend to tell you the plot or content.Justspend two-and-a-half hours for this movie and i assure you that you will feel the essence of Great Cinema..."
10,Always on the top!,"Awesome! A great movie that helps us to enjoy the old-fashioned styles along with war, mafia, drama. I am always a super fan of this genre and want to rewatch this movie so many times."
10,There are movies and there is this....,"There have been so many made over the years and there is the Godfather. What an amazing movie. The acting by all the actors(Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale & all the others)was just amazing. The level of detail the director went down to all the scenes was very very impressive and something that I'm yet to see in other movies. Both of the cinematography and the music score are perfect. We know nothing is perfect but this simply is just perfect. For example: The way the scene in the hospital was carried out was simply amazing. All the silence used in that scene really made things very tense for the viewers. From all the movies I've ever watched that scene has made me the most tense.

Watched this movie exactly 40 years after it's release, but loved watching every minute of it. Not every such movie keeps a watcher interested for the whole period of the show but this is different."
10,This movie force me to fall in love with cinema,"It is an absolute honor to review this movie, for which I discover my true love for cinema. With powerful casting and great direction this movie will fulfil every aspect of true cinema. As like its title, this movie is a godfather to others."
10,Best movie of all time!,"This is easily the best movie ever made in history. Everything about it is top notch, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the lighting. There will never be another film like it."
10,The best movie of all time,"Probably the best movie of all time. Everything is so good that an almost perfect work has emerged. It is a movie that will shine like a star in the world of cinema for years. After this movie, no ""mafia"" movie has been better than this, and probably never will be.

The actors played their roles very well. Nino Rota has made excellent music. The costumes, locations, and camera angles combined with Coppola's great direction have created one of the best works of art in history. Although it has been a long time since the film was shot, it still stands in our memories as a masterpiece. Thanks, Paramount, and appreciation, Coppola."
10,Isak,"A true masterpiece, the best movie of all time. The acting by Brando, Capino, etc are outstanding. There is not a single movie out there as good as The Godfather, period."
7,Good Movie!!!,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.

The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.

Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.

But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.

To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.

But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.

Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).

Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.

If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
2,Boring,Extremely boring & slow movie I've just wasted my time
10,Never gets old,I can watch this movie over and over again... One of the best movies of all time. Every body's good in this movie especially Al Pacino. A true classic!
10,Number 1 on IMDB for MANY reasons,"This movie is a true classic. EVERYTHING about this movie is good. The directing, the acting, the sets, the screenplay, etc..... My favorite character was of course Michael. But, the rest of the cast is also worth note. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is one of my favorites, as is Diane Keaton as Kay.

The story itself is not just a underworld crime drama. It is also about a simple immigrant family who is just trying to get along in the world. It is also about the relationship between Michael and Kay. It is also about the changing relationship between Michael and Tom.

This movie had two sequels including Part II which also won the Best Picture Oscar when it came out. This is something that hadn't been done before and hasn't been done since. The sequel to any movie is not supposed to be as good as the original. However, Part II was as good if not better than Part I. Bravo!"
10,The Godfather Review,"The Godfather, released in 1972, is a landmark film in cinematic history. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the movie is set in the world of organized crime and follows the Corleone family in their struggle for power and survival. The Godfather is not just a movie - it's a cultural icon that has had a lasting impact on the landscape of contemporary popular culture. In this review, we'll delve deep into the world of the film, exploring its themes, characters, and lasting legacy.

Set in the 1940s and 50s, The Godfather is a tale of power and betrayal within the hierarchy of the Mafia. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family, is one of the greatest cinematic performances of all time. His firm yet gentle mannerisms, iconic catchphrases and overall characterization make the character an unforgettable one. The film starts with the attempted assassination of Don Corleone, and the subsequent fallout from this event drives the rest of the narrative. Along the way, we witness the rise of Michael (Al Pacino), Vito's youngest son, as he steps in to protect the family and takes on a leadership role within the criminal underworld. As the story progresses, we see the complex relationships between characters and the lengths they are willing to go to protect and preserve their power.

The Godfather is a study of humanity and the darker side of human nature. Coppola's direction and screenplay by Puzo highlight the themes of loyalty, family, and consequences of one's actions. The movie does an exceptional job of highlighting the interconnectedness of the Mafia and the importance of loyalty amongst its members. The Corleone family is the embodiment of the concept of family - blood is thicker than water and family always comes first. The scenes of family gatherings and rituals are some of the most iconic moments in the film, giving the viewer a glimpse into their lives and their values.

In addition to the themes present in the film, The Godfather is well-known for its technical aspects. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is excellent, using shadows and lighting techniques to create a moody atmosphere. Willis's use of color tones and framing, creates a sense of tension and mystery, and it adds to the overall effect of the movie. The music, composed by Nino Rota, is also an essential ingredient to what makes The Godfather a masterpiece. The theme music has become synonymous with the film, and characterizes the grandeur of the Corleone family, as well as the somber tone of the movie.

In conclusion, The Godfather is a movie that every film enthusiast should see. It's a beautiful movie that stands the test of time and is a cultural milestone. The film's mix of drama, action, and themes has cemented its place in cinematic history and its influence is still felt today in popular culture. The Godfather is more than a movie - it's an experience. If you haven't seen it yet, go ahead and watch it, and if you have watched it, it's worth revisiting. It's a movie that always has something new to offer and leaves an indelible mark on its viewers."
9,Great all around film,One of the greatest all time movies i have ever seen. 10/10 would recommend
10,Family,"Movie is just Love! The remarkable thing is that the first priority of Godfather is his family. Movie is just telling you how do you gain respect in your life but without family everything is useless. The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines (""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche"
7,One of the best,One of the best movies that can one can enjoy watching.
1,What the heck!?,"I can't believe that I wasted my life on this crap. My dog, Sonny, died yesterday because I made him sit through this flaming pile of horse excrement. He ended up hijacking a semi and driving it into the Grand Canyon. I sniffed the T.V. while this was playing, and lemme tell you, it smelled like freaking' turds!!! If I ever saw this movie again, I would have to do things that will have me killed in every country to the filmmakers, actors, actresses, animals and trees associated with this rotten Indian food covered in bird feathers.

Once, I had a drink of water. The water had a worm in it. I didn't know that at the time...Now back to the review.

I missed that worm, he crawled out of me like that creature from the movie ""Alien"". The doctors said I was gonna die. I guess I showed them... They will learn the true meaning of suffering. They will feel the wrath of Bob the Worm!!!!!! Anyway, the Godfather killed my dog, so therefore, it sucks donkey poop. Peace, it sucks. 1/10"
10,The God of all movies.,"A ten by far. One of the greatest pieces of film ever to be created. Nothing can compare to it's magnitude. Perfect. Brando's greatest performance along with Pacino and Coppola. Like it's title it is the ""Godfather"" of all films. A template for all films to follow."
10,the Goodfather,I will be never satisfied of watching it. everything is perfect in this movie.
10,My 2nd Favorite Movie,"Perfect. That is the only word that can truly describe this epic. Truly one of the few films that deserved a Best Picture oscar. Coppola and Puzo have given us a story that is at a shakesperean level. Honor, Family, Loyalty, these are what is important to these characters and you see it. The characters are so real that you communicate with them. I found myself talking to them and yelling at them. You feel for these people. Truly this is more than a movie, this more than a film, this is the epitome of what all movies should be."
10,A father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes.,"In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of it's own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Let's get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, let's think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this film's score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous 'The Godfather Waltz', Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get it's award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made."
10,A very nice work.,"I wouldn't believe it if someone else told me that this movie would be so special. One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Flawless acting, editing, music... It is even more binding as it is a film series."
10,"It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged","It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily."
10,The Godfather,One of the greatest ang related movie. Al Pacino's and Marlon Brando's acts are amazing.
7,All-time classic,"People often compare ""The Godfather"", which in many ways is thought of as the original crime drama, with many others that have come since(namely Goodfellas). However, I have yet to see one of these films surpass the original Godfather; it really is as great as everyone says it is.

Based on influence, iconic moments and authenticity alone, ""The Godfather"" has entrenched itself deeply in film history. The acting, character writing, cinematography and screenplay are all outstanding and make the three-hour long runtime more than worth the experience. In particular, I was most impressed with the ensemble staging when a crowd was present which, combined with the editing, kept the film more than engaging enough even when not much was happening. There are more great iconic moments in this film than I care to name; ""The Godfather"" has been referenced and mimicked countless times. Yet even without the glow of its influence, these moments would stand well on their own.

This film can be very daunting for a first-time viewer. It is nearly three hours long and a universally acclaimed classic that one feels the pressure to appreciate. However, I promise you that this one has earned every bit of praise that it gets."
4,snooze,Before i fell asleep i was extremely bored. couldn't tell you what the plot is whatsoever.
10,A masterpiece,"A masterpiece of cinema Marlon Brando emerged from the darkness and oblivion in the most memorable role of his career. Al Pacino reflected as anyone how they had to accept the dark side so much wanted to avoid. The rest of the cast does not make you shade. An intense James Caan, Robert Duvall one phlegmatic and John Cazale who suffered the emotions of her character, been forgotten by his family but that power ends up changing it. An intense story, second to none. The rest of the cast does not make you shade. An intense James Caan, Robert Duvall one phlegmatic and John Cazale who suffered the emotions of her character, been forgotten by his family but that power ends up changing it. The beautiful landscapes of Italy, gang wars and violence and cruelty of power are ingredients that brighten"
10,Neve' seen that befo'. Is is good?...anybody?,"I've never actually seen this movie, on account o' my Dad won't let me watch certain R rated films such as The Godfather (#1 on IMDB's top 250 list), The Shawshank Redemption (#2), American Pie, Road Trip, Catch 22, etc. I heard the movie was good though, and I trust whatever I hear if I can't prove it wrong, so I gave the film a 10/10. A must see."
10,The best adaptation ever,"While I'd probably rank ""Vertigo"" and ""Citizen Kane"" above it, I don't have any problem with ""The Godfather"" topping the list.

A lot has been made of the gorgeously classical style that Coppola uses, and it's proof that a director doesn't have to break new ground or reinvent film grammar, a la ""Memento"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" (both of which I love), to be creative and inventive.

The acting is brilliant, something that even the usually blind Oscars recognized, which caused a logjam in the Best Actor category. My favorite performance is one that often goes unnoticed: Robert Duvall's muted, pitch perfect Tom Hagen.

Perhaps the most neglected aspect of the film is how brilliantly Coppola and Puzo adapted the novel. If you read the book, you'll find that all the novel's strengths are on display upon the screen, while none of its weaknesses, or even interesting extraneous material, appear in the script. Since Coppola had recently written a great script for ""Patton,"" a notoriously difficult feat considering the subject matter, and Puzo went on to co-write the unfortunately hilarious ""Earthquake,"" I think most of the credit should probably go to Coppola.

This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made."
10,Good movie,This is a very good movie I really liked it and I love the storyline of this mlvie
9,A classic movie.,"Plot and everything is good, but there's one thing I do n' t like. It seems that men need to think a lot, take a lot, but children and women don't. I feel a little sexist."
10,Masterpiece,"Brando and Pacino were amazing the story was amazing, so iconic, nostalgic and inspiring. Best Along with part 2 the most beautiful and entertaining movies ever."
5,Over Rated,"Once Upon A Time In America is a far superior movie. Francis Ford Coppola shoots his movies like asshole, but then again so do his pals Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. If Sergio Leone had directed this like he was originally asked to, it would have been great, but he didn't, he passed it by. Martin Scorcese also would have made a harder kick ass version and I don't mean more violent, I mean Just-Plain-Better. Instead you have the weak cinema of an overrated narcissist. Of course it's a decent film, but it's far from a timeless classic like the afore mentioned OUATIA. It's as dated a Dirty Harry, but you don't see that in the top ten films of all time. The greatest technical achievement made by the film makers was in the field of Special Make-up Effects, by Dick Smith. That is all."
9,"Loved this movie, its just remarkable","This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role."
10,"I want to rate it 10 million stars, but i only have 10...","The greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. Unbelievable acting by all actors specially by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Brilliant script, story and the plot. This movie is perfect from every spot. You can't find a single flaw in the whole film. This film will be remembered for centuries and is gonna take some effort to beat even after all these years!"
9,Matchless Movie !,I watched The Godfather back in 2012 .. but then I read the novel in 2017 and watched it again ...It is haunting and captivating tale of a mafia organization 9.5/10
10,My second favorite movie,"Behind Schindler's List, this is my second all-time favorite movie. It is so rich in detail, and style, and acting. EVERYTHING that is on the screen has a purpose, and EVERY bit of dialog is important. If not at the moment, then a few frames later. It is without a doubt the best movie in the mob genre. If it wasn't for this movie, movies like Goodfellas, and Casino could NEVER have been made.

One comment on The Godfather Part II. While it is great and most certainly deserved every award it got (including best pic), it is simply not as good as this one."
10,Must See,"The Godfather is a must see. Most of the movies today have taken some of the elements from The Godfather. This movie is well done, well told & well shown. I wish most movies today took the time to make sure the details are as noted in The Godfather."
3,Not for me,I don't typically like gangster mob films. I tried this film because I thought it would be a good film to see as a student studying film. I didn't like it and I guess I should have known I wouldn't. Cheers to those who do.
8,review,"A landmark classic of the gangster film genre. One of the lines in this movie that stood out to me was ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""Confident and relaxed."
9,This is a curious film,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great.It's excellent in arts - design, cinematography, editing, and music."
10,THE MASTERPIECE,The best classic movie ever.. To truly get the best affect of this movie you have to see it more than once. (I have only seen this once but I promise you I will see it again)
10,10 stars out of 10.,"The Godfather is a technically instructive film with its dark and realistic atmosphere. The cinematographer of the movie, Gordon Willis, used shadows and contrast in such a way that you say this is the movie while watching it. While watching the dark and beautiful atmosphere, you also watch the plot. Mafia theme is a theme that I have loved before. The film chronicles the conflict between the Carlone family and Comma Solozzo over her drug business. Although ""The Godfather"" is a crime movie, it is actually a movie based on the father and son relationship. The best example for this is the scene where Don Vito and Michael are alone. It was a pretty good movie for me, but I can understand that it might not appeal to everyone. In this movie, your main focus is not on the life of the mafia, but on the fact that you cannot trust anyone but your family and you have no one but them. In the movie, we see that almost everyone has betrayed the father, except for his sons. That's what I meant when I said you can't trust anyone but your family. Watch The Godfather not as a mafia movie, but as a father and son movie, only then you will understand this movie.

Thank you for reading."
9,An Icon Revisited: The Timeless Brilliance of 'The Godfather' (1972),"In the illustrious realm of cinema, ""The Godfather"" (1972) emerges as an enduring masterpiece that transcends time. Director Francis Ford Coppola orchestrates a mesmerizing journey into the clandestine world of organized crime, where the formidable Corleone family reigns supreme. Marlon Brando's magnetic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, alongside Al Pacino's nuanced depiction of Michael Corleone, immerses viewers in a realm of intrigue and power struggles. Through its intricate storytelling, immersive cinematography, and evocative score, ""The Godfather"" etches itself as a cinematic gem, leaving an indelible imprint on the collective consciousness of audiences and filmmakers alike."
10,Absolute,"Personal opinion this is the greatest film ever made. Not much to say, it is the absolute movie experience. Everyone should enjoy this old time classic. Needless to say it never gets old!"
10,Masterpiece!,"This movie is masterpiece of cinematography. The story, characters, action and massage of this film is brilliant."
9,ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,The Godfather is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. I love the opening sequence. The drama and the crime is what really makes this movie phenomenal.
10,"Everyone seems to love this film... Well, I love it too!","This movie is a classic... You can watch it twenty times and still find it awesome. A young Al Pacino doing a great performance, the unforgettable Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, and my favorite character, Tom Hagen, beautifully played by Robert Duvall. The Godfather is a long film that doesn't get people tired... something pretty uncommon. The violence is very well portrayed in the assassinations scenes, I don't want to write any spoiler, so you will have to watch the movie to understand me... Also the music is extraordinary, musicians like Nino Rota are very hard to find. For those reasons and for lots of others, I totally recommend watching The Godfather... and also The Godfather II & III (I think they're not as great at the first part, but are really worth-watching)."
10,True perfection,"I didn't think i would ever give a movie a 10. There is always something to say. I watched the godfather when i was younger and recently watched it again after 15 years. It is a true masterpiece. Everything is perfection. The characters and how they develope, the storyline and the way it is filmed. The olschool music is just the icing on the cake. I already liked it in my childhood, but fell in love rewatching it. It's just a trip through nostalgic perfection, enjoying every second of it."
10,Cinematic Marvel,"The Godfather"" stands as a cinematic triumph. Marlon Brando's iconic performance, coupled with Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction, crafts an unparalleled mafia saga. The film's intricate narrative, exploring power dynamics and family loyalty, captivates viewers. The cinematography and score enhance the film's immersive atmosphere. A true classic that continues to influence storytelling in profound ways. With its unforgettable quotes and intense moments, ""The Godfather"" secures its place as a timeless masterpiece that redefined a genre.""The Godfather"" remains an indelible part of cinematic history-a masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences across generations."
10,Mafia Movie,"Marlon Brando plays a strange role in The Godfather. It seems that after several decades of acting and, of course, more importantly, living in his own unique way, he has reached a certain result; A philosophy that we also see in numerous videos of his interviews. In response to the question of how he became a great actor, Brando always answered that his whole life was acting and he had to act for everyone. Maybe this way of commenting is also a gesture; But I think that this is the factor of his self-confidence, no matter how much he has come to believe this. In my opinion, acting is related to all body movements, but all these techniques end with the eyes.

When we look at Al Pacino's wonderful games, there is no need for joker-like games and shouting and anger. As Al Pacino does all this perfectly; But what makes a really good performance, and not just golden sequences, is in Al Pacino's eyes; Especially in the movie ""Smell of a Woman"" who plays the role of a blind man! Brando also does not push himself in the role of the godfather, nor does he scream except in one sequence, nor does he make such a strange expression on his face that other good actors cannot do; These are the eyes that exude true confidence.

The Godfather is a story of a beginning and an end. From gaining and losing power. From the father who is setting down and the son who reaches the peak of power unintentionally. Coppola's realism has caused humans to be shown only as agents of power; Not the real powerful. The poster of the movie, which shows the hand of a puppeteer, well expresses the basic view of the author. Let's not forget that the original author of this enduring story is Mario Puzo, although without Coppola's cinematic genius, The Godfather would be far inferior to what it is today. Don Corleone wants his eldest son to rise to power, his daughter to be happy, and of course, to maintain his personal morals and not turn to drugs. He rejects the requests of other gangs to enter the drug business, because he knows that in the future he will lose part of his power, which is the police force. Morality for Don Corleone boils down to something that will affect his own future. We can say that he is not worried about harming others and his heart is burning for himself; But the criterion of judgment is the decisions and choices that are made.

In this way, the older we see the godfather, the more we identify with the lonely, proud and dangerous character of Don Corleone. Because we realize more that our fantasy also ends in a life similar to his. The unpredictability of future events and human's constant confrontation with this truth is the main focus of the Godfather story. At first, Michael has the potential to fight, but he still prefers to keep his emotions in check and not follow his beliefs. Michael's metamorphosis is the event that justifies the character of Don Corleone."
10,see it,The best gansta film of all time... go see it hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
6,Interesting movie,It was very interesting. I love this genre of movies.
5,Highly overrated Movie...,"IMDb Rating: 9.2 Major awards : Won 3 Oscars Best actor award :Marlon Brando

One question : Did it deserved? Answer: Absolutely Not

I didn't grow up in the 70s, and I understand that every movie belongs to its generation. After watching this movie, although I cant say I didn't enjoy it, I am far from considering it best movie ever; and certainly it is absolutely preposterous to make it #1 here.I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3 hours.I had a very high expectations from this movie after reading lots of user reviews that this movie is a classic cult and base for all the upcoming mafia stories.

My problems with this movie:

1- Pace : the movie was 3 hours long. I couldn't watch it at one go as it became too boring in the middle

2- Character development : There was no character development. I couldn't understand why Al pacino fell in love with the gal in Sicily spite of having a girlfriend and how shamelessly he came back to his x girlfriend after loosing his wife without giving any concrete explanation

3- Editing: The entire trip to Sicily was unwanted and could be avoided to shorten the movie. There were many unnecesarly scenes in the movie

4- Acting : Personally I don't think Marlon Brando was suitable for this movie. As for a gangster I would consider someone with a very high vocal. I don't feel he deserved the Oscar as he did nothing extra ordinary

The Good:

1- James Caan acting 2- Good start to the movie 3- Few good scenes here and there 4- Good acting by Al Pacino in the climax

Final Verdict: Highly Overrated. Definitely not the ""best movie ever material"""
9,This is a thought-provoking film,"""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."" This is his negotiating skills. He is in one hand and Martinez, elegant gentleman had a knife in one hand; Is talking dirty business, wearing noble suit professional killers; He just need a gesture, can let the other people would be worth; And only takes a smile is enough to GanGeHua into olive- branch. They are awesome role, is also a good dance assassin, both politicians and the funeral hall boss, seems to be always waiting to listening to the gentle call he, because he promised that the noble ""one day, perhaps the day will never come, I'll let you do things for me. But before that day, please accept the justice at my daughter's wedding, this is I send you a gift!"" So, what gives the magic of the godfather is so deep? Let he just sat there, between the dark corner of the room, as if place oneself in the center of the universe black hole. People respect him, love him, and fear him, and he is so complex, and so deep. The great thing about the godfather is, he knows himself as emperor ""underground"" of responsibilities: the greater the power, the greater the responsibility. So he always adhere to their own beliefs, no drug harm. For which he refused the drug lords, loss demands, even to a fatal disaster. It is so, ""the godfather"" tells us that as long as you can face the world with dignity, you can live with dignity. So he can casually with top political figures adept, from the bottom of society to the top, he can weave a net intangible and multifarious. So, both in the interests of the family strife and Diocletian Augustus's wiles, godfather always seemed to have all possess the ability and verve, isolated from the sentient beings, overlooking the sky."
9,Better with age,"My father tried to sit me down and watch this when I was younger. He had always said it was required viewing. I never understood it and subsequently forgot most of it until I just recently watched it again. Wow, just wow. I felt all of the emotions every character portrays in this masterpiece of american drama"
7,"A Masterful Exploration of Family, Power, and Corruption","The film stands out not only for its meticulous storytelling but also for its artistic craftsmanship. The direction sets a high bar, enveloping viewers in a world that feels simultaneously real and heightened. Notable is a role that adds unexpected layers to a character who might otherwise have been reduced to genre clichés. Beyond being an engaging crime drama, the film probes deeper, exploring unsettling themes such as the corrupting impact of power and the moral compromises often made in the pursuit of success. Its multi-layered narrative and compelling characters make it more than just another mob story; it's a study in human complexities that has earned its place as a pivotal work in the annals of film."
3,The Godfather Part I,"Even though I gave this film a three star rating (pretty high for me), I consider it one of the more overrated ever. Reviewers from some newspapers and magazines gave it strong advanced notices, and that got the ball rolling before other media and the public saw it. Plus it had almost an all-star cast headed by Brando, often considered the king of American actors of his generation. Granted Pacino and some of the others were young but most of the cast had some reputation going in.

I know Coppola had not directed much if any but was known as a good writer, especially from ""Patton."" My gripe with the movie is it is basically an overblown melodrama with a lot of hype and gloss. The cinematography is good but not great. The acting: while a few minor people are good, Brando is terrible, mumbling more than ever with those cotton balls or whatever in his cheeks. Why did he think he had to play it this way? James Caan gives the best performance. And the flick is hackneyed, an old-time gangster one, full of violence and anger and crudeness. It is not film noir. They took the crime genre and Hollywooded it up, trying to make something grandiose. Two gangs pitted against each other, using gages and fifty caliber submachine guns. So what else is new? ""Little Caesar"" was better."
10,The Godfather,"Best movies ever in history, I am from Germany and I loved it, My name is Henning Weigand and I have watch this movie 100 time."
9,Its fame outstrips its strength...,"This is a very good film, with well drawn and engaging characters. It is also impeccably acted which coupled with Coppola's eye for detail really helps the world feel authentic. The script's biting criticism of American capitalism is well done and subtle. It is perhaps too subtle because people tend to miss it upon first viewing.

Nonetheless, the notion that is the best that Hollywood has to offer is nonsense. While the film is is structured as a punitive plot Michael only get his just dessert is Part 3 of the saga. Morally, this film is incomplete until Michael dies along. I would not go so far as to say this film makes evil look good. But both does it straddle the line between making characters you can relate too and character you like. Vito, especially, is a bit too charismatic.

The film is is actually rather rough in places. The hospital scene has a slapped dash quality to it; the wedding sequence has multiple warts in terms of night for day shooting, continuity, deep focus framing etc. Likewise some of the action (i.e. Sonny's beatdown) is stagy and false. On the whole it is exceedingly well directed but Coppola's inexperience (or studio pressure) shows up in places.

This is a very good film. It is not the transcendent experience I was expecting."
10,A MUST WATCH,If you haven't seen this movie and you love Filmmaking... something is wrong.
10,Brando's Portrayal of The Godfather A Masterpiece,"Marlon Brando, certainly one of the greatest actors of our time was magnificent as The Godfather. No one including Damian Chapa, who I produced ""Brando Unauthorized,"" for could quite portray this actor. This is why I rate ""The Godfather a 10. The filming in New York was located in parts of Little Italy, of which had to be approved by the bosses. Paramount at that time reluctantly went along with this project, and in the end results was a box office hit."
10,An immortal cinematic masterpiece in the history of cinema,"Coppola's immortal cinematic masterpiece in the history of cinema, the greatest cinematic film, has an impact in the world of films. The greatest director in the history of cinema and the greatest acting. Marlon Brando, the godfather of world cinema, has played a great role in the history of cinema 10/10."
9,watch this!,One of my best. it add some kind of classification in my life. thanks
10,The Godfather,"The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Superb movie in their time. This movie is good."
10,Best,"This movie is the best , if you don't see this you lost half of your life"
6,The world inside the underworld!,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
1,Probably one of the Worst movies I've seen,"This entire series being a classic, I had to watch it. I regret all of it. It was 12-13 hours of my life that I won't get back.

This movie is horrible. The plot moves slowly, drearily, and almost nothing happens. Audio is shabby, and understanding what is going on, and most crucially: WHY? is incredibly difficult. Keeping track of who is what guy is also difficult, as the names are rarely said; the lighting is poor, making this even worse. I didn't know who was who until the third movie, which I had to force myself to watch.

As a classic, watch it. Doesn't mean you have to like it, but now you can say why you hated it, which is the best part for me."
10,A very influencing film,This film has been a major favorite.. Loved every single part of the film
10,The best film of all time,"This definitely deserves to be the top film in the IMDb.com 250 best films. It has so many memorable scenes which will live in the memory of those who see this film for ever. Scenes such as the wedding at the beginning, the shooting of the Don, the death of Sonny, Michael outside the hospital and when he's in the restaurant when he kills Sollozzo, the death of Vito in the garden and perhaps the best of all, the eventual hand over when Clamenza kisses Michael's hand and says ""Don Corleone"".Marlon Brando puts in a career defining performance in his portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant with Al Pacino showing that his casting for the role of Michael Corleone was inspired. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Caan as Sonny Corleone also deserve mention. The Cinematography is sensational as is the direction by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is even followed up by a sequel that all but matches this film in its brilliance. Quite simply the greatest film ever made!"
10,"Rewatched and Rewatched, this movie is a masterpiece !","Well, after all these years and this movie remains a masterpiece. What can i say, the acting performances (especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino), the script, and the director's work, all were perfect. It's one of the few movies that they can describe as life-changing. But the reason i rated it as 9/10 is because of the time, this movie was perfect but too long."
10,Must watch!,"Best movie film of all time a must watch ,!!!!!!!!"
8,great,"Best out of all 3, great to watch with friends or family or with your pet. like your cat or maybe your dog spot. well I dont know if his name is really spot or just a nickname. what was it we were talking about? oh yeah, the godfather, great movie."
10,"It is so unic, that every time i see it, i find something new.","My story with the Godfather started as a growth man, in fact i watchet it for the first time at the age of 21. I'll never forget when the credits rolled over and the music started play. A feeling i have only experienced a couple o times.

Everyone knows the plot, so there's nothing i can say about that. The only thing i can say about this piece of film making that has over 50 years old, is that we never ever saw anything like it again, simply because there is nothing that can beat it, is the perfect story, the perfect cast, the definitive screenplay. And that's it.

So, whenever someone ask you wich movie you can recomend to others, it doesn't matter the kind of film they expect, this will be always your first recommendation, if there is such person in the world that has not seen this masterpiece yet."
7,It's good...but nowhere near the greatest,"I first saw The Godfather around 25 years ago, long before I became a film buff. I thought it was good, not great. When registering on IMDB a decade ago I rated it a 7/10 from memory. Incidentally part II I rated a little higher, an 8/10 due to the engaging flashbacks.

Ten years of being a film buff...I've seen some incredible works in that time (including two Coppolas, namely his Apocalypse Now & Dracula). Curious if The Godfathers are as good as their 9.2/9.0 ratings on here, I purchased the Bluray-Restoration Trilogy and just now watched the 3-hour first movie...only my second watch, and the first time since 25 years or so.

....and my opinion is unchanged! The Godfather is a good film. It's very well made, with tons of neat intelligent scenes and dialogue. Well acted. Fitting music. Decent camera work. But it's also tricky to follow, a few times I wondered who characters were referencing...this isn't a problem I've had with Goodfellas or Sopranos. Michael's relationship drama with his two wives isn't really that compelling, and neither is the paranoid mob war. The motives of the antagonist mobsters don't feel convincing.

A couple of action scenes have dated badly. One scene has Sonny punching clear air but the sound effects are claiming contact. Tho' the death scenes were generally done well and still look good today.

Curiously, there's often no offered subtitles when the characters talk in Italian. Specifically an important restaurant scene is missing this. I later watched an online clip with the translation, and I disagree with Copolla: the subs should've stayed in. Also, the image-quality isn't that impressive for a claimed 4k-mastering restoration. Very deep blacks for indoor scenes, meaning you struggle to differentiate among all those black suits. I guess they were going for a chiaroscuro-style (like Caravaggio famously employed in his paintings), so this gets a pass.

7/10 feels absolutely fair. Yet poll after poll still puts this movie right at the top (or very close) in the all-time rankings.

Citizen Kane is one of those I feel deserves such a reputation. The Godfather...not so much.

Part II next. Let's see if it holds its 8/10 (hopefully improves on it!)."
1,I Hated this Movie,"I read a while back that ""The Godfather"" was a favorite book of an author I enjoy. I hence picked up a copy, and was enthralled. I had heard how great the movie was so I watched it, and I was appalled.

I grant you, the movie follows the book closely, but it doesn't understand what makes the book work. Most of the actors know what to do, and Al Pacino is perfect, but Marlon Brando is clueless. Vito Corleone is NOT a thinly veiled thug. He is a caring man, who is forced to do some horrible things. But in the end he accomplishes far more good than evil. This only makes Micheal's transformation in the book more horrible, because the deaths he commits serve no such higher purpose.

Also, scenes of great importance are removed, Johnny Fontane is barely in it, Santino's girlfriend has a cameo, and the Doctor is nowhere to be found. I know these character's don't directly effect the plot, but they give it an emotional foundation to build upon. I cared about them more than any of the other characters. I know Coppola had to cut the book down for time to do a movie, but he would have been better off doing a mini-series instead."
9,Best mafia movie ever!,"Despite of the fact that this movie is so long, I watched it tens of times. Every time I watch, I feel like to start a gang and get killed."
10,"What I expected, therefore perfect.","Honestly this review is going to be short because this film is excellent in any field you could imagine - visually amazing, acting more convincing than any movie I've ever seen, the score is iconic and the screenplay is so vast in scale, but manages to be amazing. if you put the end of this movie next to the start, it wouldn't make any sense, but just as all great films, it makes sense anyway while immersing you into the cinematic experience. If you haven't seen, then you need to free up a morning or evening with or without friends and watch it with your undivided attention."
10,AWS,"Most film reviews are intended to guidereaders in deciding whether to view, rent, orpurchase the film. They should provide thenecessary information to aid readers indeciding without divulging any fundamentaldetails, such as the storyline or any surprises. This paper is common in schools because thelecturer wants to evaluate the student's abilityto think critically and report the event easilyfor others to understand.

Movie reviews typically present a briefsummary of the film's storyline. They providereaders with an overview of the characters,

Good movie best seen awsm place than I hope you watch know."
10,"This Is , The Amazing Film","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study."
1,A movie is not worth your time.,"The movie is very long and the directing is bad to the extreme, the characters are badly written, the character who tries to be scary and the ones who try to be attractive but they are all vulgar, and the dialogues in the film are bad and also the drama is bad."
9,A Thirty Suttin's Perspective Of The Godfather,"Its amazing how movies from the 70's are so different from the movies in 2020. The Godfather really goes in depth as far as character development is concerned which for many younger viewers may seem boring. Well buck up kido's and keep watching because this movie is amazing.

The film makers of old really put a lot of thought into not only complex characters, but settings, backdrops, and the muic. No matter your age, if you are going to be a film critic you are goign to have to watch this film and learn to appreciatre it by watching it multiple times until you do.

On a side note, if you are looking for someone to fool around with in the bedroom, Bdirti . com is the place to go these days for that sort of thing.

So yeah, get a few pounds of popcorn popped for this one, cuz its a long one. Peace!"
10,Awesome!,"Best movie ever! I think that Coppola get his capolavoro with this movie. The Pacino's transformation its one of the most inspiring creative acting works for any actor or actress that who has ever dreamed of becoming an actor. Marlon Brando's performance is truly unique it was a revelation to my life to have known his work. You can watch the movie two hundred times, it's never gonna get any worse. The way Puzo weaves the script and takes it to the awkward areas where we have to accept that we don't want Santino or the gift killed. It's an act of mastery and mastery when it comes to writing a script and identifying with a mafia boss to the point that we feel part of the family. Duvall's work is sublime."
10,PIECE OF ART,"Review of ""The Godfather""

Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" released in 1972, is a cinematic masterpiece that has secured its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, this epic crime drama captivates audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and profound exploration of power, family, and morality within the Mafia underworld of 1940s and 50s America.

At the heart of ""The Godfather"" is the Corleone crime family, led by the iconic Don Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando's portrayal of the aging patriarch is nothing short of legendary, capturing both the ruthless determination and tender familial love that define the character. His raspy voice and imposing presence command every scene he is in, making Don Vito a figure of both fear and admiration.

Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, the youngest son who initially wants nothing to do with his family's criminal enterprises. Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader is portrayed with subtle intensity, showcasing his character's moral descent as he becomes increasingly embroiled in the world of organized crime.

The supporting cast is equally exceptional, with James Caan as the hotheaded Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as the pragmatic Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Michael's innocent wife, Kay Adams. Each actor brings depth and complexity to their roles, adding layers to the intricate web of relationships and betrayals that drive the narrative forward.

Coppola's direction is masterful, employing a deliberate pace that allows the characters and their motivations to unfold naturally. The film's cinematography, by Gordon Willis, is striking, using shadow and light to heighten the drama and emphasize the moral ambiguity of the characters' actions. The score, composed by Nino Rota, is hauntingly beautiful, underscoring the film's emotional weight and dramatic tension."
9,Screenplay,I like the screen play of that movie it is just not a movie it is the best play ever I watch any movie before with this type of screen play
9,A must watch for any naive movie enthusiast,"This is a must watch for any filmlover..From the opening scene itself the movie shows its class...I hadn''t seen any alpacino movies before this one.Have heard about him though...In the opening scene of this movie,I was taken aback by the performance of an old man just showcasing some great piece of acting skills...Didnt know who it was..Later after my watch I surfed the interview and found that it was mone other than the great alpacino himself.... Throughout the movie he was just majestic as Vito Corleone.The movie deals with gangwars in the best of ways without showcasing much bloodshed..The slowly picksup its pace without ever falling into too much pace and confusion...It is a well crafted movie...Hatsoff to the Director and the ensemble starcast.."
9,gangster epic movie,"After watching the entire film of ""The Godfather 1"", I felt that it was exquisite, exciting, and inexhaustible, showing the exquisite skill of the film master, and the three-dimensional image created by each character, making this movie worthy of being called ""man ""The Bible"", the charm of the godfather 's character, what 's different is that all the benefits are exchanged and the family is right. The family view and the friendship with friends are deep, so that you can re-view yourself from your own world view. A far-reaching romantic gangster epic movie"
10,One of the best movies ever seen!,"Godfather was truly magnificient in all aspects..Marlon Brando was simply superb, his most touching dialogue 'Keep your friends close and enemies closer' still echoes into my ears when I come across the name Godfather! Not forgetting Al Pacino, who played Brando's son, was just too good to watch..All in all, a GREAT CRIME MOVIE EVER!!!"
7,BEST FILM OF ALL TIME ITS AMAZING,"Best film ever its so amazing i have enjoyed every step and second in this movie God is great am one of those who did it.

Keep providing us the best stuff ever so so good to watch alot of teachings am keem fame i enjoyed the film so much."
1,i feel bad rating this,I feel bad rating this because everyone seem to love this firm and i just .... bored. The movie is so slow and so long i cant believe i sit though. The acting is great but cant save the movie in my point. Idk maybe this is just not the movie for me
9,Jens de Ridder review,"An exciting, long movie with a top cast. It is very handsome that the second part not under does for the first part. Both parts certainly have a place in my top 10.

A true classic. I immediately had sympathy for the characters in the movie, with no real knowledge. Which is very up to the family is that everything is running. (OTF)

The Godfather movies are real must views for every mafia film follower. The main characters are excellent on the folder set by actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in the second part, who plays the young Vito Corleone."
8,"8.1/10 - A Tragedy, Soaked with Shadows","I'm super close to finishing the IMDb top 100 poster now, and I'm so, so hyped for that. It's been three and a half years since I've started, and getting so close to the top is unreal. Now, in my journey throughout this poster, I've came across all sorts of movies, expectations-wise: movies that I've heard little to nothing about beforehand, movies that have already been on my watchlist when I got the poster, movies I've seen but many years back, movies that are only there because people from a specific country love them (I'm looking at you, India). The thing I'm getting at is this: my expectations from movies are varied and very individual to each movie, and they are influenced by a lot of things. The Godfather is one of the movies I've been hearing about for years now, knowing how immensely impactful it is on cinema. Friends, fellow film lovers, one of my sisters - everyone just kept telling me I HAVE to watch it, a feeling that has only gotten stronger after watching Apocalypse Now - a great war movie by the same director - but me going from bottom to top on this poster meant not getting to watch this one for years, and I knew that when I started this whole journey. Now I'm here, though, after my rewatch to this film. Let's get into it.

The Godfather is a 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola, based on Mario Puzo's book by the same name. The movie follows the Corleone family, an Italian mafia family in 1940's New York. The movie tells their story throughout a decade or so, with special focus on Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the least involved in the family business of all the men of the family, and the way he gets pulled into the conflict - and the family business - when things go awry, and a bloody war starts with another big mafia family.

The first thing to catch my attention here is the cinematography. Many a film nerd have talked about how each shot here is soaked with shadows, and how the inner mafia world contrasts with the innocent, well-lit exterior in scenes like the famous wedding in the first act. They have crowned the cinematographer, Gordon Willis, as ""prince of darkness"", and analyzed each scene down to the last frame. Honestly, though? This is just, simply put, one the best-looking movie I've watched in quite a while, easily. It's not just the lighting - it's the composition, the attention to the background, the color grading. I think about a beautifully shot scene at a funeral, with flowers in the background, I recall another in a little garden where oranges grow, and so many more pop to mind. Even supposedly simple shots, with just one or two characters and very simplistic background, can become hellish, desperate, soaked in grief of sorts. The movie really does a great job on that front.

The dialogue is very iconic, too, with many lines popping up when looking back at the movie. It's not just about being quotable, referenced endlessly and everywhere - it's about the film's ability to make dramatic impact. When looking at today's mainstream cinema (and cinema in general, throughout history, though I do feel like in recent years it's been more of a phenomenon), so many movies are trying to pull off badass moments of dialogue, to be cool, to ingrain a moment into our brains, but when they have nothing up their sleeve it just makes everything cringy, tryhard, stiff (side note: you're more than welcome to read my latest film review, for The Dark Knight Rises, an example to such a movie). The Godfather manages to pull off so many great lines of dialogue with a lot of dramatic impact, and almost effortlessly at that - much of that thanks to actors such as Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, who deliver very good, natural performances here. Showing these underworld interactions in a movie and making it believable, well-written enough to not break the immersion - well, that takes some skill, and the people who were working on this movie definitely had it, and it shows.

In movies, and generally media, of this sort - you know, crime-centered stories that depict characters who get sucked into the underworld - the world of crime often seems alluring, luxurious, brimming with wealth. Even safer than the ""ordinary"" world, at times. But sooner or later it is revealed, in many of these stories, that the characters have been dancing on thin, thin ice for this whole time, and their bloody dance can make them fall right into cold, hellish depths just like that, swallowed by their greed and the violence of the underworld. The way that even in their happiest days they need to look over their shoulder, the tension between this deep, familial, loving bonds, that mix in the so-called ""business"" so much that it's hard to understand if the family is the goal and the crime is the means, or if it's vice versa - there's something very tragic about it all. I think that the movie captures this very well. We care for the characters, and when they fall into the dark pits of the underworld it has an impact, especially when we know that things could've been so much simpler had they chosen another path. And besides, just the tragedy of being born into it, being connected to evil acts by blood, knowing you could never escape your name, creates this dark feeling of determinism, dark fate. Works well.

Pretty much every male character here behaves like douchebags at least in some instances - violence, self-importance, misogyny, you know the drill. It's easy to notice that these characters act in ways that are not only illegal, but are also often immoral, or at least morally problematic. Despite that, we also get to see their more caring side, the bonds they have with each other, the love and respect they have for Vito. I feel like we're shown different facets in ways that really make the main characters feel more human, even though they're knee-deep in the crime world. And kudos to the actors, again, for delivering characters with complexities in a convincing, immersive way, especially Brando as Vito, who steals the focus of the plot even when he's off-screen. My point being: the characters here are written in a way that reveals both their humanity and their darker sides, which makes us relate to them just enough to be emotionally invested, and emphasizes the tension between those two sides. I like the movie's approach to that.

The pacing is also solid, which is not to be taken for granted - pacing can be a challenging thing to manage with movies of this sort, that let their plot unfold throughout a decade or so, and a pretty long runtime, too. With The Godfather there's almost always something interesting going on, some tension, this pulling sensation that makes me want to discover more. I wouldn't say that this movie has kept me at the edge of my seat constantly, but I would say that the pacing here is indeed solid, especially in the final act. This movie is a bit of a slow burn, in some ways, but it's always in escalation, always raising the stakes and making the characters change. I will also say here that the soundtrack is very solid as well - it just works well when it comes to creating an atmosphere, and it's used pretty well. It's not my favorite soundtrack ever by any means, but it's recognizable, echoing the tragic themes this movie is focusing on, and it usually hits the spot.

The Godfather is a tragic portrayal of a crime family who's getting sucked into a bloody war, where no one can stay uninvolved, no family member can step aside and let everything drift away. It's the best-looking film I've seen in quite a while, and it shows characters from every angle, the loving and caring one as well as the harsh, violent, ruthless one. A rise and a fall, a fall and a rise - no stability can be expected when living on the thin ice. The tension between business and family here, and the alluring luxury of the underworld, made me think of Breaking Bad, which, though maybe anachronistic, is a big compliment when it comes from me. I'm feeling an 8.1/10 on this one. A very good movie indeed."
8,Best movie,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is more than just a film-it is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the movie explores themes of power, loyalty, and family in the world of organized crime.

At the heart of the story is the Corleone family, led by the aging patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an iconic performance). His reluctant son, Michael (Al Pacino), undergoes a compelling transformation from a war hero uninterested in the family business to a ruthless mafia leader. This character arc is one of the most fascinating in film history, brilliantly portrayed by Pacino.

The film is a masterclass in storytelling, cinematography, and character development. Coppola's direction, combined with Nino Rota's haunting score and Gordon Willis' moody cinematography, creates an immersive experience. Every scene is meticulously crafted, from the chilling opening sequence to the gripping finale.

What makes The Godfather exceptional is its balance between crime drama and a deeply personal family saga. The film humanizes its characters while never glorifying their violent world. With standout performances, memorable dialogue, and a powerful narrative, The Godfather remains one of the greatest films ever made."
10,A True Classic,"Hands down, The Godfather is the best picture ever made, in my opinion. The Godfather II is also a great film, and so is Citizen Kane. Hollywood, in its heyday, made some incredibly classic films, which makes it rather difficult to choose which ones are best. I have chosen The Godfather. Have watched it many times, and it never fails to keep me interested and entertained."
10,The story of Corleone family,"I'm not going to waste my time and my words on the plot or the summary of the film, but I'll write about the feelings that I proved watching ""the Godfather"". This film is a perfect movie and the cast is one of the best ever seen: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire... The majority of the actors are still appreciated and sought-after. The cinematography is wonderful; the soundtrack is very good (when I hear the trumpet at the real beginning I have the creep). I was really surprised when I read that ""the Godfather"" won only three Academy Awards: it should have won at least 10 of them. ""The Godfather"" is one of of the films that will be remembered even many years by now, and it's without doubts one of my favourite movies (with ""the Godfather - part II and part III"" and ""Braveheart""). Don't miss it!"
2,Never did like it,"I recently saw the godfather again, 34 times I think. Now, never was a Brando fan, can't stand mob movies, so why should I like this one? Simply, because everyone else does. Its not that the acting's bad (except for brando) its not that its a mob movie, OK, it is that it is a mob movie. I mean seriously, pick a better topic! Not a realistic view of the mob. The mob did things quietly never have I heard in history of a mobsters getting gunned down in his car by many bullets. Oh, and another thing, if this movie is supposed to be realistic, why did the gas can blow up when the shot the car?

Only see this movie if you love mob movies and love brando"
10,Best movie,Best film for us...I'm die hard fan. I saw too many times even with my grandfather oh my god it's amazing.
10,A Beautiful Movie to Watch,"The first time I watched The Godfather was at 19, and I just barely understand why people so praise about this movie at that time. The second time I watched it was about 8 years later. This time, I just felt so heavy when I finished watching it. ""No Country for Old Man"" It is kinda biased to feel sympathetic with the tragic experience of Don Corlenone, but his persistent responsibility on the family and his indestructable dignity, deserve every drops of my tears. Marlon Brando had given a legendary performance in this movie. The performance from the young Al Pacino was also unshadeable. A story about a Father and a son, and a story remind you of becoming a real man with dignity and responsibility."
9,An Epic!,"There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.

Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.

Right movie from the beginning of the movie, the music is haunting. It pulls you towards itself, like the fatal attraction of parvana to the shama. Marlon Brando is characteristic. There has never been another Don in history so charming, honorable and one who is also a true family man. A Don who respects his friends and never forgets a favor.

The transformation of Al Pacino from the distant lad who says ""That's my father, Kate, not me"" to the emotional son beside his father in the hospital ensuring him ""I am with you now"" to ultimately the unprecedented words pronounced by him ""I am working for my father now"" underlines the storyline.

Some of my favorite dialogues by the movie are: ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man."" ""I never ask for a second favor when I have been refused the first."" ""Don't tell me you're innocent, because it exhausts my intelligence."" ""Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family."" ""Women and children can be careless but not men."" The distress look on Brandon's face when he finds out his war hero son is invariably pulled into the underworld business, the silent tears of acknowledgement when he hears the news of his other son's murder and simply says ""I want no acts of vengeance"" shows that some actors don't need big dialogues to act.

The final stages between father and son are beautifully portrayed. A concerned father advising his son, the last person he thought would be his successor. And the dutiful son consoling his dad that ""We'll get there"".

The music is not just background score but also underlines the essence of the movie. Attentions to details like the steady flow of water, chirping of the birds, are hard to ignore.

The climax of the movie where he lies with so much conviction to his beloved wife completes the transformation of Al from a civilian to the head of the Corleone family."
1,are you all out of your friggin minds?!?!?,"this movie was more boring than church! they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody! Michael Corleone is a little girly man! and that Sonny guy, no one intimidating is named Sonny! when he got blown to bits, i laughed....hard! Then there's Vito! What's with this guy? Does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth? why does he look like that? and what's with that name...Vito? who names thier son after a presidential command! it could only be one typed of people, hillbillies. Italian Mafia hillbillies. If you want a real good movie go see Santa With Muscles! he'll stop them Corleones!

1 out of 10"
10,Still the best movie ive seen,"Still the best movie ive seen, i love this movie and watch 5 more time in 1 year"
10,The Godfather is an insightful sociological study,"The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone."
10,GOAT,"There are many more things that I should talk about this movie but I'll cut short. Cinematography, realism, script, emotions, actings, musics and so many other things make this movie Greatest. And there's an important point. All of these was made in 1972. Can you believe it? It's like invent a flying car. For those years circumstances, this movie is beyond masterpiece."
10,Al Pacino and Marlon Brando,"Al Pacino and Marlon Brando Two great artists who played a work that is unique throughout history.

The scenes of mafia gang management in Tous Brando's film, as well as the precise performance of Al Pacino as the young son of the family, who is a military man, are truly unique. Francis Ford Coppola founded a family in the 70s that ruled Hollywood and world cinema for many years. The second part of The Godfather has a more mature content and story than the first part. In my opinion, the exhibited plans from the olden days and Al Pacino's childhood in the village of Corleone are unique. It has been about 50 years (half a century) since the release of this magnificent work of art, and it is still one of the leaders of world cinema."
10,A truly excellent drama about a life of a mafia family,"Today a very well known movie and for me the best ever. The story is based on the novel -The Godfather- from which the movie obviously got its name and it follows the most part of the story in the novel. The cast is also excellent the stars who play each character fit their role in the movie perfectly. Some parts of the story may become confusing to some audience if they don't pay much attention to the movie, i found the movie more interesting when i watched it the 3rd time because I had missed some tiny details which make this movie so good. The story won't become boring, it keeps you watching the movie all the time because you really want to know what will happen next which is quite rare in many movies. The effects are also done well for the 70's period, they look very realistic. The movie really gives you a good description of that dark period in history in a non boring way.Those who enjoy watching drama will love this movie."
10,Great movie ever,"Not too much, for me this is the best movie ever seen. It offers business lessons that no one else can teach. I and the ISO Logistics brand have applied and implemented in business extremely effectively."
10,A Story about Family and Murder,"The Godfather is a masterpiece that is almost so beloved that people have forgotten why. This movie has some of the best written dialogue ever put to screen. This movie is also unmatched in its acting, still being one of the greatest casts ever. On top of all of this there is a great story of someone becoming a family man even though that goes against what he previously thought moral. Micheal Corleone has one of the biggest character arcs of any character ever, he is a totally different man by the end of this movie. The Godfather is a timeless movie and inspired a generation of film."
7,A Good Man,"I think this film shown different believes between one man, that i think was a good mad in this film, and all of world as rule of out side people"
1,GREAT AND A CLASSIC. BUT PERHAPS OVER-RATED?,"The Godfather is a great movie and, in a series of three, the quality didn't diminish. The second installment won the Oscar for best picture, and it deserved it. However for those who read the book first, it is all familiar territory. Marlon Brando has only been better in ""On the Waterfront"" and Al Pacino has never been better, that is saying something. The film is perfect, almost. The book is better than the film and rarely get's mentioned. Emotion is there, but an age old stereotype get's enforced along the way. Everything else is perfect and earns the honour of being a true classic. The problem with the first installment, the second one was somehow better."
8,honestly i didn't like it,"As Peter Griffin said i didn't like the movie.... 😂😂😂 totally agree ""It insists upon itself"" brilliant!!!! I love family guy and also don't get the Godfather.

For me it was a bloated mess of a film, with the storyline often not possible to follow, and other times not worth following at all. I also completely despised Marlon Brandos performance - I know many people will shout loudly for me for saying that, but I honestly thought it was a borderline pantomine performance.

There are some great, iconic moments in the film (the restaurant, toll booth etc...) but for a film this long, they are few and far between."
10,The best movie to be ever done.,"Grown up watching this, and its a classic that everybody should watch at least once."
10,The Godfather: A Masterpiece of Crime and Family Drama,"The Godfather is a classic crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo. It tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful mafia clan in New York, and their struggle to maintain their power and legacy in the face of changing times and enemies. The film focuses on Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino), the youngest son of the aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), who reluctantly joins the family business after his father is nearly killed by a rival drug lord. Michael's transformation from a war hero to a ruthless mob boss is one of the most compelling and tragic character arcs in cinema history.

The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and a masterpiece of storytelling, cinematography, acting, music, and editing. It won three Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brando, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo12. It was also the highest-grossing film of 1972, and for a time, the highest-grossing film ever made2. It has influenced countless filmmakers and genres, and has spawned two sequels, The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990).

The Godfather is a film that transcends its genre and explores universal themes of family, loyalty, power, corruption, violence, and morality. It is a film that deserves to be watched and rewatched by every movie lover."
10,The film that reaffirmed my love for cinema.,"Undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.

Francis Ford Coppola is not only responsible for this masterpiece, but also for its sophomore release, which is also in my top 10 list of films, along with another classic, Apocalypse Now."
10,Art - a masterpiece of Filmmaking,"This Movie was filmed in 1971/2 but set in the 50's. Pulling off a period film with zero technology in such incredible detail is a testament to the director & the production crew.

This is not a fast paced movie, it's genuinely a pice of art that doesn't try impress, but it may well capture you!!

Every aspect of the film is exceptional, there isn't a single poor performance, I can't think of a movie that comes close in terms of 'across the board' acting.

The soundtrack is iconic but fits the film perfectly.

The story line is simply gripping from start to finish.

No Spoilers - but there is an Al Pacino scene that still makes my heart beat faster than any other!!"
9,Great Movie,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.

Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place primarily on location around New York City and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola."
9,I love this movie,"Everything is so real in the movie. I mean, I thought about it after watching the movie.if a remote camera had taken this life or their lives and what was going on when no one knew about it, I think the result would have been the same as the movie.

The wedding procession, all the details of the wedding procession ,marlon brando, the connection of one scene to the next scene, marlon brando, the lines, even the crying of the children are so beautifully arranged that marlon brando, al pacino and such an al pacino that it was obvious from those years that this man was not an empty man. Maybe that's how I listed two or three sentences.but it's not enough, of course. It's not enough. Need to watch."
7,Don is a great man,"Vito Corleone is Don of the NY crime family. He acquires fame and fortune by himself after immigrating to US from Italy. He has three sons and the youngest son, Michel lives honestly with no connection with gangster's business. One day, Don gets hurt by the other crime family that against him. And Michel decides to retaliation.

This story is far from my real life but I was very interested in it. I felt parental love from that Don want Michel to live not like him. Don is a great person and that is reason why he becomes Don. I think Michel does not have to fight against the men. But if I were him, I am sure to do same. This film is apparently full of violence but indeed full of humanity, emotion and love. I recommend you to watch it if you want to think about your human nature. You must be able to learn a lot from Don Corleone."
5,OVERRATED,"This movie is not 10/10 or the greatest ever made. Firstly this movie would have been made under 1 hour 30 minutes, most of scenes are just wasting time. Secondly I don't understand why people like this. Is it because of cast or there was no movie like that in 1972. Finally I just want to say this movie is completely overrated. NEVER believe these overrated reviews and comments."
10,A Brief Film on An Epic American Nightmare,"Short, Sweet, and...""to the point"". This film digs in, exposes, in a languid and gorgeous tone. What is the root of all evil, at least here in America? The Godfather, well, he might know."
8,Classic,That it is. Fantastic set design and performances all around.
10,Best Of The Best,"The greatest film making, I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.

10,One of the five or best films of all time.,"I'm unusual in that I

1) read the Mario Puzo novel in it's entirety prior to seeing the original film in the early 1970s

2) I saw the film in first run theatrical release when I was 12 or 13.

3) my initial reaction was comparing the film to the book.

But time went on, and I rewatched this film many times, and I began to see this film, and indeed, the book, in a very different light, the light of the struggle of ethnic immigrants from Southern Europe to make it in an America that was ostensibly equal to all, but in reality discriminated against Jews, Italians, Greeks, Armenians, et al.

Family, Clan, blood feud, take care of your family first, these were themes that resonated with me quite strongly as I rewatched this film.

""A man, to be a man, must have family,"" says Don Corleone in the powerful opening scene. The ritual of being godparents is powerful in the Catholic & Eastern Christian churches in a way not understood well by American Protestants.

Ostensibly a movie about the Mafia, but really a show about Family, and loyalty to family.

One of my very favorite films."
10,Superior,"My brother is a big fan of this movie, he suggested me to watch this and I must say I loved it. This is a fabulous movie of all time."
10,a great movie,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic."
10,"The Godfather I: A Timeless Classic of Power, Family, and Betrayal","The Godfather I is a cinematic masterpiece that intricately weaves themes of family, power, and betrayal into a compelling and unforgettable narrative. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone, coupled with Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone, drives the film's emotional depth and intensity. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction, combined with a stellar cast and Nino Rota's haunting score, creates an atmospheric and immersive experience. The film's meticulous attention to detail and exploration of complex moral dilemmas make it a timeless classic and a cornerstone of American cinema."
4,Long. Too long.,"Longest movie I've ever slept through. It's boring and not entertaining. The only realistic thing about this movie is that the mafia spends most of its time sitting, eating and talking. 'The irishman' was long too but it was entertaining and didn't make me want to put a hit out on myself after watching it."
10,Come on guys....keep it original,"I love everything about this movie, the acting, the imagery, the intrigue, the score...the only thing I have a problem with though is the title. Like can you really sleep at night? Like honestly REM sleep, knowing that you single-handedly stole the title of The Godfather from the demon of the north himself, Krampus. Adjacently, The Godfather 2? *Bleh* more like Jack I'm the Box Rises. Come up with something original next time, for God's sake."
10,Timeless masterpiece,"The Godfather is more than just a movie-it's a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Francis Ford Coppola's direction, combined with an incredible cast led by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, delivers a powerful story of family, loyalty, and the corruption of power. Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic, while Pacino's transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless leader is captivating. The film's pacing and atmosphere pull you in, with each scene offering rich storytelling and unforgettable moments. A perfect blend of drama, tension, and artistry, The Godfather is simply one of the greatest films ever made."
10,Years Down the Road,"I remember when I first saw parts of this movie, I was a curious child and looked up to my own dad so I wanted to see what he watched. I only remember the beginning scene, but then as I got older and I went to film school I finally went back to continue watching this film. This film really had my mind going and really remind me to why I wanted to become a filmmaker in the first place. The storytelling is the best part, just everything about this movie is just incredible in it's own way and I am glad I was finally able to watch this movie from beginning to end and it has easily become one of my favorite films."
9,God Father,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.

""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.

Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.

But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.

The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).

The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.

Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.

Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
10,EPIC MOVIE,"Still one of the best movies to date, one of my favorite. At this point I can't count how many times I watched this. I'm going to watch this over and over forever lol. Just does not get old. I consider this a time piece."
8,elegantly made mafia masterpiece,"I cannot tell you how damn LONG I've been waiting to finally see this movie! It's taken multiple excuse-less years of avoidance for me to finally muster up the time and energy to consume this delight and, now that I've finally seen it, I'm happy to say that it IS indeed a brilliant, powerful, and borderline perfect masterpiece!

I viewed this film in its restored edition on a crisp, beautiful blu-ray disc and, honestly, that's probably the best way to watch this movie. Try and find the most visually pleasing copy of the film you can find and just sit back, relax, and watch! The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and probably some fraction of what makes this film so memorable and beloved to this very day. Every shot is a painting within itself...mundane actions now take on this otherworldly elegance only seen in the finest novels and most stunning works of art. Just staring at this film makes it well worth the three hour length.

The performances are also all spectacular, largely because of how fantastic the cast is. We all know about Marlon Brando's Oscar- winning performance, and how breathtaking that beautiful monologue of his towards the end is, as well as the fine acting efforts done by Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and (in a much smaller role) the great Sterling Hayden, not to mention wonderful supporting performances from Abe Vigoda, John Cazale, Richard S. Castellano, and Talia Shire, among plenty others.

Nearly every scene is engaging and gripping, and the three hours are quite quick and the overall film flows like a steady stream of neverending goodness...there isn't much else to say about this one. While I may not think it is ""the greatest movie of all time"" as some others like to label, it is still a damn good (scratch that, I mean GREAT) one, and must be seen by all!"
10,The Godfather,"The Godfather's discussion of religion looms large, with the boundaries of good and evil blurred by grace, warmth, kindness and family. The godfather upends the conventional wisdom about the gangster. Instead of being a bully, the gangster can be gentle and gentle. The director orchestrates mass assassinations and deftly USES a cross-montage of revenge. When Marlon Brando spoke in the calmest of voices that he would make an offer he could not refuse, the violence of the underworld was maximized and great aesthetic tension was generated."
10,very good,This movie very good. It's a perfect masterpiece. This movie is probably one of the best works ever. Movies of this quality are rare now.
5,"10 stars because this very well made film, 0 stars because of it's message","This film is in the top 10 movies of most of my friends. I can see why: it's a very good movie BUT... I higgly dislike the main side effect of this movie and how many people seem to suffer from it: romanticising the mafia, making heroes out of the worst people on the planet. If you think the public is sophisticated enough to see through this and grasp the real message of the film: mafia = evil, Don Corleone is less evil than the others but is still evil, than guess again."
10,10/10,"Beautifully crafted film, definitely a lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers."
10,"my opinion, the movie is classic. but very heavy","I don't remember when I first learned about the movie The Godfather, but it's impossible not to know it. Still - the greatest gangster tape, one of the films that turned the world cinema and left a mark on culture comparable to Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. The first time I tried to watch this film was in 2015. And I did not master it. I understood that there was a great and clever canvas in front of me, but I simply could not master it. For me, The Godfather was like a classical music concert: beautiful, but incomprehensible. But, after 5 years, having prepared, I decided to re-watch the film and now everything has changed. I really liked this film, but at the same time I do not like it because of the extremely bad message."
10,Just wow,"This movie is the definition of masterpiece.

All the movies is something special but this on is the one that 9 from 10 viewers pick as their favourite."
10,Perfect,"Yes--this is the great American film. It is a work of art from the vision of a brilliant director who synthesized his amazing knowledge of world cinema with a

completely American persona--mob story, love story, suspense story--and got

together the greatest actors of the time to create a work of such power and

brilliance that it has deservedly taken its place among the great artistic

achievements of all time. Everything came together so perfectly in this film. Seeing it in its opening week in 1972 (at a midnight showing since all of the other times were sold out--unusual at the time), we simply could not believe how the 3 hours flew by so fast. It was a breath-taking experience. It was so

intriguing, so riveting. From the opening wedding scene straight through to that door closing in Diane Keaton's face--we sat there in amazement. And in the

numerous times I've seen the film since--it has retained its punch and its

marvelous power to entertain and engage."
10,being a gang,"""The Godfather"" is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, and for good reason. Francis Ford Coppola's epic crime drama is a masterclass in storytelling, boasting an impeccable cast, stunning cinematography, and a riveting plot that has captivated audiences for decades.

The film's exploration of the Corleone crime family is both fascinating and gripping, with complex characters who are both ruthless and sympathetic. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is iconic, and the supporting cast, including Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, are equally outstanding.

Coppola's direction is masterful, creating a world that feels both authentic and larger-than-life. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is unforgettable, perfectly complementing the action on screen.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It's a must-see for any film lover and a true testament to the power of storytelling."
10,Best movie ever made,"Not too sure how this movie is not rated #1 on top rated movies. This is the movie that set the standard for all the mob movies that came after it. A picture that is truly remarkable as far as story, setting, and scope."

2,"More like the Nodfather -as in I would rather be nodding from heroine then watching this boring, crummy movie","In my Facebook Group Movie For Mother they recommend the boringest, most boring crummy dumb moveys that they ever did make!

Citizen Kane? More like Shitizine Kane! Vertigo? More like the movie was so boring it make me so Boredigo.

So finally, they recommend this movie, it were call the God Father and they sayed it was going to be the gangster movie, I did not see Twopack or 50 Cents in the cover of the movie but I did see Scarface Pacino I know that not his real name but it wasn't the right Scarface actor because in this movie he did not start to turn into looking like a turkey!

Anyways I turn on this movie when I put Stephanie into her crib, and it was so boring that I was sooooo bored the hole time.

I know Mexicans are violent, but the Mexicans they show in this movie just look so bad and so violent that it was scary and boring, and I'm very offended that they recommend that I watch such a offensive boring slow movie where nothing happens the whole time, I wish that they make us watch more of the best movies like click by Adam Sandler or species."
8,A classic of cinema.,"I like Mafia movies, I think Scarface and Goodfellas, two masterpiece, but The Godfather was never much of my taste, I find the movies very good, but not him and 2 are not movies that would speak that are better than the story , The initial scene of the film is excellent, has heavy moments, excellent dialogues, a very good script, the direction of Coppola is great, the truth is that Coppola is an excellent director, unfortunately he made more bad movies than good, the cast Is great, Al Pacino at the beginning of his movie boom, and Marlon Brando does one of the best performances of all time, from an excellent character that is Don Corleone, I think the film is very big, so the rhythm falls a little , The soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, The Godfather is an excellent film, even if I do not find a masterpiece, its quality and contribution to the cinema is undeniable. Note 8.7"
10,"The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to be celebrated for its masterful storytelling","""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has established itself as one of the greatest films in history. Released in 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the movie captivates audiences with its gripping narrative, unforgettable characters, and remarkable performances.

Set in the world of organized crime, ""The Godfather"" follows the Corleone family, led by patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his sons Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). The film delves into the intricate workings of the mafia, exploring themes of power, family, loyalty, and the consequences of a life surrounded by violence.

What makes ""The Godfather"" truly exceptional is its ability to create a rich and immersive atmosphere, transporting viewers into the dark underbelly of the mafia. The film beautifully captures the essence of the 1940s and 1950s, with meticulous attention to detail in terms of set design, costumes, and cinematography. The haunting score composed by Nino Rota adds another layer of depth to the storytelling, perfectly complementing the on-screen events.

The performances in ""The Godfather"" are nothing short of extraordinary. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone, for which he won an Academy Award. Al Pacino, in his breakout role as Michael Corleone, showcases his incredible range as an actor, transforming from an innocent young man to a calculating and ruthless leader. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, all contribute immensely to the film's brilliance.

Beyond its gripping narrative and impeccable performances, ""The Godfather"" presents a thought-provoking exploration of morality and the corrupting nature of power. It raises profound questions about the choices individuals make and the consequences they face in a world where honor and loyalty hold immense significance."
10,A family tragedy,"Most filmgoers who rhapsodize over this wonderful film probably place an inordinate stress on the violence and the politics which connect not only one family, but several, in this sprawling tale of post World War II America. With apologies to those of Italian heritage, I think the tragedy of the Corleones is less a matter of ethnicity than their ruination by blood which is set in motion by two evils: greed and a lust for power. The film is one which sets off the family or clan, [the neighborhood as victim] against the larger, unforgiving American society. The characters are wonderfully realized and splendidly acted. They appear as if drawn to life for the first time. The sinister atmosphere of the film, from its great opening sequence to its frightening close, is a nearly three-hours-long treatise on the disintegration of a family. The Corleones are revealed as equal parts melting kindness and merciless vengeance. The Godfather's turning point is Captain McCloskey's unnecessary assault upon Michael. The meanness of the violent act unhinged the human ideal in the Don's young son. From Michael's understandable love and need to protect his helpless father in an unguarded, creepy hospital emerged his irrevocable decision to cast away any desire to become successful in the eyes of legitimate society. The slow, sure gestation of the plan to assassinate both Captain McCloskey and Virgil Solozzo is one of the major rewards for anyone who loves this film. The seamless transition of Michael Corleone from a patriotic, dutiful, obedient son into a cruelly vengeful and malignant weapon is terrifying portrait. The title of the movie applies to both Don Vito and to Don Michael, with the son slowly eroding the warm and loving family, painstaking built by the father, into a loveless, cheerless collection of individuals adrift on a sea of loneliness and treachery."
9,well done,This movie is one of my best. it add to my life some kind of classification
8,A great film,"Although I would not consider it the greatest movie ever, I would still give the Godfather a 10/10 and am willing to say that it is quite an amazing film. It is emotional, involving, and the performances are top-notch. A film that is good in every category, The Godfather is definitely better than it's sequels and my second favorite Coppola film (I liked Apocalypse Now a bit more)."
10,For Me is a nice movie,"Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as an insightful, tough elderly person, really has the character lead in the film; Al Pacino, with a splendidly evolved presentation as Michael, is the lead. In any case, Brando's exhibition is a dexterous expendable, despite the fact that it earned him an Academy Award for best entertainer."
10,"The Godfather"" (1972): A Timeless Masterpiece and Its Impact on Life","""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not merely a film; it is an enduring phenomenon in cinematic history. Released in 1972, this epic crime drama offers more than just a glimpse into the life of the mafia; it provides profound insights into the complexities of family, power, and morality that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide.

Profound Narrative and Emotional Depth At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a poignant exploration of the Corleone family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in a role that stands as one of the greatest in film history. The movie delves deep into the dynamics of loyalty and duty that bind the family. Each character is meticulously crafted, allowing the audience to experience their personal dilemmas and moral conflicts. This portrayal enriches the viewer's understanding of their own familial bonds and the responsibilities that come with them."
7,Great film,"They don't make these epic films anymore.

I thought it was a tad too violent. Not my taste.

Perhaps the best thing about The Godfather is that, even though the characters are involved in some questionable activities, they aren't really made out to be bad guys; you keep cheering for the Corleones almost no matter what they do. Some people might use this as criticism but I think it is rather refreshing.

Finally, the film is so well crafted in almost every aspect; the sound (particularly in the scene where Michael Corleone kills Sollozzo and McCluskey but also Nino Rota's score, of course), the cinematography (there are some stunning shots) and the aforementioned acting is all top notch. And yet, I think it falls a bit short of a masterpiece even though I have very few complaints."
5,Overrated,"I think this is one of those movies which are ""immune"" to any kind of critic but maybe that is why it's considered to be one of the greatest movies. No one can say otherwise. But I've seen better. It's not even the fact that it's old and there are some scenes that seem ridiculous since I watched it first time in 2023. Partly it was a good and beautiful movie but not even in the top 10 I've seen.

It was far too long and I know there are people who say ""you just can't concentrate"" but I beg to differ. There were lots of scenes that were unnecessary long for no reason at all.

Also one of disturbing things was that the characters were just so uninteresting that I was waiting for them to die. Acting was mediocre, mostly just overdramatic yelling which has nothing to do with being a passionate Italian.

Now I have watched it once and that's enough. The other parts of this series can go in the category ""I'd rather stare at a wall for three hours""."
10,best movie,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly com."
9,great movie,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him"
10,One of the best films of all time,"I watched this masterpiece only a couple of months ago and of course with a lot of expectations, im not really a guy who seen a lot of movies but from the start i knew i was watching one of the best movie ever made. The story goes really fluid and all the characters are insanely good written, i really liked from the start Michael, and Vito. Overall the film goes really fluid and even tho i prefer the second film of the trilogy i cant hate this one, and i really think that this is a masterpiece that everybody needs to watch at least one time in life. I end saying that.the shots in this film amazes me so much every time i rewatch this title."
10,Greatest movie of all time,I've learned so much from this movie on how to be a man and how to address challenges and difficuties as a man.
10,what else can be said?,Its a master piece! a must watch and highly recommencement to any fan of film.
7,Awesome,Awesome movie i love this movie.. i like this types movies a lot
2,Why is this movie so highly rated?,"Three words to describe this film... BAD BAD BAD... Not worth five minutes of your time... Goodfellas and Casino are lightyears better. Ok, maybe that is a little harsh, but seriously, this is not one of the top 250 movies of all time... it does have some merit, so maybe overall it deserves a 5.0/10 ... but, given that this movie is lacking in so many other areas, I have no choice but to award it a 1.0/10.0"
10,"For me, the best movie of all time",The godfather is for me the best movie of all. Al Pacino's performance is impeccable. The direction of Francis Ford Coppola shows what a great director he is. A masterpiece.
10,"Sorry guys, no part 4....ever!","I am sorry t say that the commentary made by francis coppola at the end of part 3 on the DVD editon clearly states that for the last ten years of Mario Puzo's life they discussed a possible part 4 of the godfather, hoping that they could evolve upon the rise the corleone family business, as a whole. I.e.: how they gained political influence among society, how michael grew distant and how the rest of them drew close, and then skip 40-50 years ahead to vincent corleone losing the bussiness that was worked upon so hard to gain, through drugs and loss of all political influence and respect, whilst haunted by the loss of his cousin love, and ironically have one final scene with Michael and vincent before michael died. i.e.: this would be a part 2 narrative.

This was majorly discussed, but time was not on puzo's side to write it, and francis refuses this to be done without puzo.

One might say ""How about Scorsese?"" but lets face it, this was a coppola/puzo thing. Scorsese would take it off track like any other director, even someone like Speilburg couldn't do it!

It's a crying shame as this seemed like an all time classic to erase the existence of part 3's disaster!"
9,Very classic gangster movies.,"The gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, the music soothes the faint sadness, the interest game human nature conflict. Whether it is acting or lens, the use of music, give people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this film is extremely need to sink down to savor carefully, and no matter when it comes out to relive can have new thinking."
10,My Best movie ever,"The godfather is the most favorite movie ever the three parts are the most great movies in the history in my opinion it contain the fathers of our cinema now days, a story that tell the truth about the mafia and even the people who control the illegal business and the way that end up. shows the family that always feel proud of its own Sicilian origin's i already watched this movie more that 12 time with friends, family, and I'm even ready to watch it more and more, Don Corleone is one of my favorite characters and the way he always shows of the strong man that doesn't know how to bow and give up easily and at the same time you can see the part of care about his family in the last seine and the part of killing his eldest son Tom, and always KEEP YOUR FRIEND CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMY CLOSER."
10,"For Me, This is the top movies classics","I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather"" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless."
10,"Loyalty, Legacy, and the Loss of Soul: Why The Godfather Still Reigns","The Godfather"" is not merely a film-it is the cinematic equivalent of scripture. Directed with near-religious precision by Francis Ford Coppola, this 1972 magnum opus transcends its gangster genre trappings to become a sweeping meditation on power, loyalty, identity, and the corruptive gravity of legacy. It is, quite simply, a masterclass in narrative architecture, tonal control, and myth-making.

From a technical standpoint, the film is a symphony of visual and auditory restraint. Gordon Willis' chiaroscuro lighting-earning him the nickname ""The Prince of Darkness""-imbues every frame with tension, secrecy, and moral ambiguity. Nino Rota's score doesn't just accompany the film; it mourns it. The editing, the production design, and the blocking are all executed with the discipline of a military operation, serving not spectacle, but mood and meaning.

But beneath the aesthetic lies the soul of the story: The Godfather is a Shakespearean tragedy wearing a tailored suit. Michael Corleone's arc-from reluctant outsider to cold-blooded patriarch-is one of the most chilling transformations in cinema, not because it's forced, but because it feels inevitable. The film dissects the myth of the self-made man, revealing the rot beneath the empire he inherits.

What's prophetic about The Godfather is its portrayal of systemic power as familial, hereditary, and inescapably violent. In a world now run by corporate dynasties, political bloodlines, and algorithmic empires, the Corleone family's quiet handshakes and whispered betrayals feel hauntingly contemporary. The boardrooms have changed, but the rules haven't: loyalty is a currency, weakness is a liability, and the system always wins-unless you become it.

More than 50 years later, The Godfather is still the film that every serious director bows to and every institution secretly fears. It is art that not only entertains, but indicts. It asks: At what point does power stop being protection and become pathology? And how much of your soul must you forfeit to preserve your name?

This is not just cinema-it is legacy, fate, and consequence, distilled into 175 minutes of perfection."
8,Artan Avdiu,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
6,good movie,Took many tries to get threw it but still a must see
1,Wasn't overly impressed,"Let me tell you first and foremost that I have viewed plenty mafia movies, not to mention I own several as well. The first thing I have to say about the Godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab, its almost as the Director is trying to make Americans fall in love with criminals,not to mention a bad display of Italian Americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as Goodfellas. The question we must ask ourselves is""Are Italians really that thick headed and vulgar?"" and the answer is a resounding no. You almost get the impression that Vito Corleone is a homosexual and that James Canns Character has a mental diffieciency. The only good character depicted in the movie was Al Pacinos part. A man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond me.The only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which I thank Francis for"
10,Amazing film,"The film delves into the multifaceted world of the Corleone family, a mafia clan that navigates through the tumultuous waters of crime, power, and familial obligation. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is both intimidating and deeply human, crafting a character whose quiet, composed demeanor belies an undercurrent of ferocity and sagacity.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is both intimidating and deeply human, crafting a character whose quiet, composed demeanor belies an undercurrent of ferocity and sagacity."
10,The Family of the 20th Century,"From Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather, to me, was the movie of the 20th century. It had the perfect cast, screenplay, story, characters, set design, ect. It deserved every single Oscar that it was nominated for.

The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family and their life of living in the Mafia territory. It tells how Don Vito (Marlon Brando) struggles to keep up with his business and how he will pass it on to his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino). The movie also tells about the life of Vito's oldest son Sonny (James Caan), the famous Fredo (John Cazele), and Vito's daughter Connie (Talia Shire).

Produced by Mario Puzo (Superman) and directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Outsiders, Dracula). The Godfather is the greatest movie ever.

Cast includes: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazele, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden."
8,One of the Greatest Gangster Movies!,"This is one of the best mafia crime movies ever made!

The story is very clearly presented and easy to follow. The soundtrack of the film is Killer and adds immensely to the atmosphere that surrounds the story. The acting is top notch especially by Marlon Brando. He has created a character that is hard to forget and certainly one of the most iconic characters of 20th century cinema. Unique and unforgettable!

My rating isn't a 9 or 10 for the reason that I don't particularly like Al Pacino's character, which to be honest - annoys me. And not a nice annoyance, if you understand me, but more - I feel the character is boring and a bit redundant. In 1-2 places the storyline didn't draw me in as I would have liked.

But overall the film is a masterpiece and I highly recommend it to fans of cinema, the crime genre, the power of the Italian mafia in America at the time, etc.

Final score: 8/10."
10,One of the best i have watched,"When best Thechnisians meet best artist the result will be GOD FATHER ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE WATCHED IN MY LIFE. The way story was narrated given goose bumps,the way characters narrated was extraordinary Dialouges of the film was quite interesting when you look for the best to watch you cant get more than this Watch and enjoy Well written,Well directed,Well acted"
10,An Offer You Can't Refuse: A Timeless Classic,"The performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family. His nuanced portrayal of a man who is ruthless in business but deeply caring towards his family is truly remarkable. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, the reluctant son who is drawn into the family business. His transformation from an innocent outsider to a ruthless leader is both chilling and captivating.

The film's narrative is rich and complex, exploring themes of family loyalty, corruption, and the American Dream. The storytelling is enhanced by the stunning cinematography and the memorable score by Nino Rota. The film's pacing is deliberate and allows the audience to fully immerse themselves in the world of the Corleones."
10,The Godfather,My mom was watching The Godfather. She liked it a lot.
7,For the very successful time,"the magic of time films

back, is not achieved in these times, failure to carry humanity, even to be violent you have to have humanity that is the magic of a film, and not those of now that only draw violence and free blood they do not make you feel that you are watching a movie but it seems that you are watching the news"
9,good title,"The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individua."
10,Still at the top of my list,"The Godfather was an epic novel, an excellent story, and the movie could have easily been botched on numerous levels; instead, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create an enduring masterpiece of modern cinema. This excellence he achieved in spite of the constant harassment and general incompetence of Paramount Pictures. Coppola was almost fired by the studio several times during the filming of this classic, yet he managed to persevere and realize his vision through to the end. The casting, direction, acting, cinematography, and story are all top notch. Add to it a beautiful score by Nino Rota and you have the #1 IMDb movie of all time. This is a movie I have watched many times and found few weaknesses.

If Paramount had its way, The Godfather would have been much different. In this alternate reality, Coppola would have been fired and replaced with some studio sycophant director. There would be no Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, since Paramount felt Brando was a troublemaker. Michael would have been played by Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford since Paramount wanted a ""prettier"" leading man. Al Pacino, despite superior acting ability, would have probably remained undiscovered. The story would not have taken place in the 40's and 50's, but instead would have been contemporary in order to minimize production costs. To be sure, the ultimate result of Paramount's expediency would have been unmitigated disaster. Thankfully, Coppola fought Paramount throughout the entire production, and much like the Godfather himself, refused to dance on the strings of those Paramount pezzonovante."
10,Masterpiece,A real masterpiece of a movie that every one should experience once in their life.
10,Young Michael Corleone is preparing for his new role as the head of the Corleone Family.,"I have just seen the movie and I must admit I'm totally blown away. Of course I've heard of it, seen clips, told of it's brilliance, but nothing could have prepared me for this movie. ""Fantastic"" is the word. The actors are amazing - every one of them. You love, you hate, you cry. No emotion is left untouched. I don't think I need to write any further. The plot, the characters etc. have been described over and over, and all I have yet to do is give my strongest recommendation. If you are a girl like myself you will for certain fall deeply in love with the human, but dangerous young Al Pacino (and he is drop dead gorgeous too!)

A classic!"
10,Absolute masterpiece,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolute masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time as one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1972, this iconic crime drama offers a compelling narrative, impeccable performances, and a mesmerizing portrayal of power, loyalty, and family dynamics.

The film revolves around the Corleone family, led by the powerful Don Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando's portrayal of the patriarch is nothing short of legendary, capturing the essence of a complex character torn between tradition and the evolving world around him. His commanding presence and nuanced performance earned him an Academy Award, and rightfully so.

The Godfather boasts a stellar ensemble cast, with remarkable performances by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. Each actor brings their A-game, immersing the audience in a world of crime, power struggles, and the intricate workings of organized crime families.

Coppola's direction is masterful, showcasing his keen eye for detail and his ability to create an immersive cinematic experience. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to become fully absorbed in the narrative and the richly developed characters. The script, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is a work of art, filled with memorable dialogue and profound insights into the human condition.

One cannot discuss The Godfather without mentioning its iconic score, composed by Nino Rota. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the film's atmosphere, adding depth and emotion to pivotal scenes. The combination of visuals, performances, and music creates an unforgettable cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

The Godfather is not just a gangster film; it is a powerful exploration of family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power. It delves into the moral complexities of its characters, forcing viewers to question their own sense of right and wrong. The film's themes and narrative continue to resonate with audiences, cementing its status as a timeless classic."
10,Best movie ever!,"WOW! As I am yet to see any of the other Godfather movies, this is the best mafia drama I have ever seen and is definitely a top 10 film! The acting in this is outstanding, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan specific. The plot in this movie is the best plot I have ever seen and it is paced so well! The ending is amazing too, what you want to happen, happens. This movie is a cinematographic masterpiece."
7,Gangs of Wasseypur replica- Gangsta movie,"I can say that this movie is a sophisticated version of Gangs of Wasseypur and if you like watching crime world then you'll love this film.

I personally don't like gangsta movies because they do not have much respect for their women. Though I liked all the Italian accent in this movie."
4,Just another violent movie...,"Just another violent gang movie, whats the big deal? I hate these sort of movies about mafia guys going around with guns thinking they are all tough, put them in a ring one on one with Tyson and see how tough they are. I Don't understand why this movie is so praised, Whats the big deal? There is enough violent gang movies around, what makes this one special? There are so many movies better than this one out there, don't waste your time with this. I suppose there must be lots of fans of this movie like there is for lots of other violent pointless ****house movies such as Sin City and the likes, I guess this just highlights that there must be fairly big problems in our society today, why would anyone find this sort of negative and pointless junk enjoyable? The way that this sort of thing is portrayed in movies as being ""cool"" is really quite sickening, I wonder how many people who have had personal experience with murder and violence would find this sort of thing enjoyable, not many I would say. If you think you are going to get anything worthwhile out of this movie think again, your life will not be enriched in any way by watching this, spend the three hours out enjoying the sunshine or talking to your friends and family or something instead..."
10,It'll Make You An Offer You Can't Refuse,"The Godfather left me completely speechless after watching it. Once you realize there's a Part II, you quickly go out and buy that as well. Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are superb in this epic!"
10,good actionmovie,"A good action ,sort off history accuresy but one o the best performance from actors sad is the this day nobody make a good movie is just this movie make me smiley that exist .All old movie are the best."
10,"no. 1 it is not, brilliant it is","OH MY GOD!!! I have never watched a film this long before then decided to sit down and watch it again. I've seen plenty this long and although I enjoyed them and watched parts of them again, I have never watched one like this all the way through. Let's take your standard gangster film, either you have the new guy just arrived in town looking for trouble, Joe from 'A fistfull of dollars', or you have the guy looking for revenge, Porter in Payback, or the cop trying to stop them, countless films. THIS IS DIFFERENT!! Sure you might say gangsters have been the guys your rooting for before but no not like this. You start with an established family, and you watch them fall into the ruin and gradually get saved. Brando and Pacino both deserve every award there is for making characters who although are often bad you can still see the old fashioned hero in. Not one bad actor, not one bad character. Not one bad moment. Yet why isn't it no. 1? Well I don't know but it isn't really no. 1 material. Perhaps its the fact you have so much story to take in and so much happens that you aren't sure whats just happened or it could be simple. I could have just expected a no. 1, a film that had me crying, cheering, yelling. I didn't get that but I cant think of one better gangster film, or one other film that deserves to be a classic like this. So perhaps it is a no. 1, for now until a true no. 1 comes along. For those of you who say 'the book was good, not sure if I want to see this', then I'll tell you this. This film is a book. not only is it a book, it's a great book. You cant put it down but when you do you can start anywhere. You can flick back to clarify what has happened, the story is well structured the characters well developed. It's well cut as if it's been edited by a publisher. I don't want to call this no. 1 because when you see it you'll constantly be judging it as a no. 1 film, like I was, and you will feel let down. However if you see it not expecting a no. 1, you will finish it having seen a no. 1."
10,excellent if..,An awesome movie if you like italian mafia kind movies.
10,SUCH A GREAT MOVIE,"Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola.,

Life Lesson: It's your duty to be there for your family, regardless of the circumstances. This will help protect them while you're alive, and leave a meaningful legacy after you're gone.

The film is a good reminder never to make decisions or act out rashly. A good example is when Sonny Corleone (the eldest son of the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone), flies into a rage at hearing his sister having been again subject to domestic abuse."
9,The film is for leaders,"I believe that anyone standing in a high or low position in society should watch this film. It reflects many aspects and carries many different meanings, especially the way of living and treating people with each other."
8,The whole,"This is a great film in that it is expertly choreographed with expert cinematography.

Ganster films are not my cup of tea but if you have to watch one it should be this one.

That being said, if you don't watch to the end then you don't get the full story/film.

The last scene is important and I mean the very last one!

Without it you are not getting the full picture.

It is subtle but it will give you shivers if you have followed the whole story.

It is long and can be arduous but you have to stick with all of it. It is a detailed nuanced story.

Again, not my bag, but masterfully made and acted."
10,As good as its gets,"This is what movies are all about, a great cast, wonderful performances, intresting characters, stand out scenes,lovely score and a great story all into one. The film may be 3 hours long but the film is always watchable and never boring, and it does not feel like 3 hours long. This is the only film out of the three that the whole family is together, which makes it easily the best.The scenes that stand out are the horses head(of course), sonnys shooting, vitos last breaths,and the five killings at the end. I dont know what it is but the film and the other two are never the same when sonny dies, apart from vito ,sonny is by far the most interesting character of the all the films even more than michael, i only wish he lived a little longer. Michael is never the same man when his brother dies, and never likeable again until the end of part 3.The last hour is all about michael,about being the new leader. Something which surprised me was that vitos character has long spells when he is not in the film, michaels probally in the film more and pacino should have won an academy award with brando. Is brando really an actor, the guy is so good, there has never been a better actor ever.My fav scenes are the ones where michael is in italy, they really are moving and lovely. This is the best film ever, no doubt"
7,Classic,"Best classic movie ever, best narco, best Italian movie, best of the best"
1,Very overrated,"Boring, unexciting, very overrated, lacking in educational meaning, nonsense, very bad compared to other mafia and gangster movies. Without a special thing! The third episode also had a very illogical and ridiculous ending. I really don't understand why it's popular with people!!! What is really enjoyable about this movie that other movies in this genre don't have? Even Al Pacino's acting (I don't deny that he's great in his other movies) was overrated in these 3 episodes! I hope that one day this movie will not be ranked first, otherwise ranking above the best movie of all time (The Shawshank Redemption) would be a disaster!"
9,The Gangster epic that nobody can refuse,"Gangster films have been one the pillars of Hollywood. Since their debut in the 30s of the Golden Age. Classics such as The Public Enemy and White Heat spotlighted the criminal life. Viewed as a true grit crime drama that not only entertained audiences but made one dream of that lifestyle with all the pros and cons. Eventually, mobsters began to faze out in favor of other genres primarily Westerns. In 1972 Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Francis Puzo forever changed how gangsters were depicted with The Godfather. It took organized crime and brought it into a realistic depiction not ever seen before. Based on the Novel by Puzo, The Film follows the lives of the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The Godfather most feared, respected, and powerful Criminal in New York. We follow over the years as Vito gets older and begins to lose power, all while through reluctance his youngest Son Michael (Al Pacino) slowly comes to power as head of the Family. The reason why The Godfather has the status that it does is because of its tone it gave gangsters more of a romanticized sort of Glorifying the Mob. Here you have this family that has all this power and respect. Its cultural impact depicted them as real people as opposed to just cutting out stereotypes. Even though it is a gangster film it is more so about the family than one of the major themes. The way families act. The use of its beautiful soundtrack and the dialogue add more Authentic appeal to Italian culture. The film shook waves with its more realistic dedication Death and the Violence felt more real from being shot to being ridden with bullets. Gives a taste of what life in a family like this was like or could be like. The acting is top-notch from everybody in the from James Caan as Sonny, his attitude very traditional wise guy quicker to anger and aggression. Diane Keaton is sort of the naive love interest. Though the two who make the film the most are Brando & Pacino. Overwhelming development Brando's Godfather is iconic everybody has been inspired by this character. This character has been spoofed and parodied in so many things. Like Carmine the Roman Falcone from Batman. He comes off as a man of honor, while in the context of this film, you don't know anything about him just more so how he's built up. However, the way Brando speaks and how he carries himself you get the idea that this is a powerful man. He honors his family he understands the plights of those who come to him on the wedding day he's not a pushover, but he is fair in a way. The progress that Al Pacino handles well from the beginning he's more innocent out of the family business., but as the movie goes on and the events that occur can kind of see how to ends up where he does it doesn't feel like you question why he goes down this path. How his mannerism changes it's a different person by the end. It's classy, and thematic it's. Groundbreaking if not for The Godfather there wouldn't be gangster media like there is today."
9,good,"The Godfather is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that stands as a testament to the art of filmmaking. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film not only redefined the gangster genre but also left an indelible mark on the history of cinema.

At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a compelling exploration of power, family, and the American Dream. The narrative weaves a complex and intricate tapestry of the Corleone crime family, led by the iconic patriarch, Vito Corleone, portrayed with unparalleled brilliance by Marlon Brando. Brando's performance is a tour de force, bringing gravitas and humanity to a character that transcends the typical portrayal of a mob boss.

The film's pacing is deliberate and masterful, allowing the story to unfold with a sense of inevitability. The cinematography, marked by Gordon Willis's iconic dark and moody visuals, adds a layer of sophistication, creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and foreboding. The use of light and shadow becomes a visual language, conveying the moral complexities and inner conflicts of the characters.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its meticulous character development. Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, undergoes a profound transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless and calculating heir to the family empire. The dynamic between Michael and his brothers, played by James Caan and John Cazale, adds depth to the narrative, exploring themes of loyalty and betrayal.

Nino Rota's haunting score further enhances the emotional impact of the film, underscoring key moments with a sense of tragedy and nostalgia. The famous soundtrack has become synonymous with the film itself, contributing to its enduring legacy.

""The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends its genre. It combines stellar performances, a richly layered narrative, and technical prowess to create a film that not only entertains but also provokes thought. Its influence can be seen in countless works that followed, solidifying its place as a timeless classic. In the realm of cinema, ""The Godfather"" remains an offer that audiences simply cannot refuse."
10,Perfect,"This movie is like a wine, the more getting old the more getting better and better and better.... This is in my opinion the best movie ever made, the cast, the story the music, the directing, everything is perfect..."
10,The best,"The best movie that I have ever seen! Amazing, the cinema at it best."
8,Awesome Movie,I like this movie and the director. You need to watch it more than 3 times
10,Amazing directing and acting,"I did love al pacino.

Also James caan and best of all was Marlon Brando acting !

I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

Id love to see more these kind movies or even tv series ! Im sure ppl would be mind blowing these kinda tv series existance some near furure the whole trilogy was amazing , especially part 2 and part 3."
10,The Best Gangster movie ever besides Scarface,"The Godfather is the best top rated movie of all times. With the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall. Topped with the Great Marlon Brando. A great cast. The plot or storyline was way beyond enjoyable."
10,The Godfather,This is not only the great movie about mob but it is the best movie ever considered in many charts. The acting roles of Brando and Al Pacino are something unbelievable. The story is great exciting intense and famous catch phrases make this movie unique and remembered in the history of cinema.
10,The Godfather (1972): A Cinematic Masterpiece with Minor Flaws,"""The Godfather"" is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was deeply moved by its intricate storyline and compelling characters. The film boasts outstanding performances from the entire cast, particularly Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, who delivered exceptional performances.

One of the film's strengths is its meticulous storytelling and the personal growth of the character of Michael Corleone. We witness his transformation from a quiet and peace-loving individual to a powerful and ruthless leader. This transformation is portrayed with great precision and complexity, and the story allows ample time to witness the character's development and motivations.

However, there is one criticism I would like to address. Although the story is engaging and filled with intricate details, I sometimes felt that the film was overly long. Certain scenes and subplots were unnecessarily prolonged, affecting the film's pacing and making it feel somewhat lengthy.

Nevertheless, ""The Godfather"" remains an exceptional film that is unquestionably worth watching. The intricate storyline, memorable characters, and outstanding performances make it a cinematic masterpiece. While there may be some minor flaws, they do not detract from the overall quality of the film."
10,Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one.,"The gangster film was pretty much the property of Warner Bros during the 1930's. And rightfully so. With their star line-up of Bogart, Edward G., Muni, Raft, O'Brien and the magisterial Cagney , how could they fail?. Public Enemy, the original Scarface, the Roaring 20's, Little Caesar. Even today these films still have a great raw power no matter how certain elements may be dated. And with White Heat Warner proved they could still come up with a truly great gangster film in the late 40's .

But when The Godfather came along in 1972 it blew away all the opposition.

The hype had really gone into overdrive by the time it reached Ireland in the Summer of 1973. Although it was the film you had to see at the time, for boys of my generation, Marlon Brando was yesterday's man.

Clint Eastwood was our idol, with the spaghetti Westerns and Dirty Harry.

And, to be honest, the wedding scene, the scene with Brando's pottering around in the garden with his grandson, and the scenes of family banter did seem to me, then, to get in the way of the undoubtedly brilliant set-pieces of violence and pad out the film unnecessarily. Seeing the sequel two years later largely helped me to confirm my original view that the original was more a star vehicle to revive Brando's career and I went along with the perceived opinion that the later film was the masterpiece of the series.

Almost 30 years later, having greatly expanded my vocabulary of World Cinema, The Godfather still ranks in my Top 10 of all time,(and I can't see that ranking will ever change) whereas the sequel, while I admire it as a great film, would be some way short.

What marks the film out as particularly special include many of the features that I found boring as a teenager: the family relationships; the jostling for positions in the family and mafia hierarchy, but especially the carefully plotted change in Michael's character. Has Pacino ever been better? Like Jack Nicholson, he was at his best in his early films, before the fame thing went to his head. And Coppola undoubtedly kept his performance and character on a tight rein in contrast to Part 2, where there may just have been a touch of caricature.

The great scenes were masterfully directed: the toll-booth assassination; the various violent deaths, Michael's cafe killings; the shocking church murders, but, overall, its the pacing and development of the film, and Coppola's masterly handling of the actors which will make this one run and run. And I haven't even mentioned Nino Rota's spellbinding music.

Of course Coppola has mostly disappointed since then, (although I will always maintain that Rumble Fish is a minor gem, )one acknowledged masterpiece is more than most directors could even dream about.

Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one. What higher praise can I give it."
10,Well worth the time,"I find it extremely disheartening that people would complain about the length of ""The Godfather."" Unlike most movies of the three hour duration, I find that when I view ""Godfather,"" not once do I look at my watch or think about how long it is. And that is simply because it is the closest thing to perfection on film that we have yet to see. Never once do I question it when I see this ranked as the #1 film on various lists. Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors. And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando. So for those of you who don't like three hour movies, you'd better stick to the 90 minute masterpieces like ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" You'll probably understand them better."
10,One of the best movies i have ever watched,"I love this movie. I discover something new every time I have seen it.

if you have watched The Godfather than you have witnessed what can be called the greatest movie of all time! This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well.

For me, there will be no movie like Godfather. Godfather is something you just can't hate."
10,Super played,One of the best ever and it actually showed the reality of the fake personality of public elected politicians and real mafias
10,Fantastic movie,"I think that the Godfather is an American classic, that perfectly mixes film and real history regarding the Italian mafia. I watched this film with my grandfather, and it was the basis for my senior thesis. i have studied Coppola' touch, and am studying to be a director myself. The Godfather is the reason that i myself am invested in the film industry. i want to make movies for the records. I want to make movies that for generations will be remembered. The cinematography is stellar, and the acting is classic. Al Pacino is playing a golden role and Marlon Brando live through these characters. this movie all around is one of the greatest movies every made for the silver screen."
1,masterpiece??? really???,"I read all kinds of reviews that call this flick a 'masterpiece'. What kind of masterpiece? I have never seen a masterpiece played on TV every single weekend. It is always the B movies that are shown that much. And I love how 1 hour and 5 minutes of commercials are added on to make this a 4 hour movie. Repeat; a 4 hour movie!?! No, it's not a masterpiece and if it was, it would still not get 4 straight hours of my time."
10,One of my favorite all time,"I live this film, i have watched it over and over again. The film give me a understanding of what people will do to get power. How family and close friend can be jealous and envy you. The producer of the film use the right technique to explain different scene in the film. The lighting and shadow technique. I think it was a masterpiece I have watch every movie all the remakes. I do think The film Theme of power, family and loyalty was displayed throughout the movie and how important it was to protect your love ones. The Godfather really was all about the importance of family and how to stay loyal."
10,A precise and flowing work,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a landmark of cinema. The three-hour film is the result of an incredibly precise brand of filmmaking. Despite the fact that the story spans a number of years and thousands of miles, there is a clear, very natural progression throughout the film (with the exception of a subplot or two). The characters are complex and varied, each playing a specific role that contributes to the story. The film does admirably well in keeping the story relatively coherent, despite its complexity.

In the film, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a powerful crime family in New York. He arranges killings and is involved in illegal gambling rings, among other things. Yet to those who love him, he is known as a man of reason and justice. He is the Godfather - a title of respect and endearment. Many seek him out for his blessing, his advice  or a favor. Despite the fact that he is, essentially, a murderer, the movie does an excellent job of making the audience respect him; the deaths he arranges are always justified in some manner to the audience. They men killed are either other criminals - usually involved in narcotics and other crimes somewhat worse than the Corleones' - or are corrupt in some way, a danger to ""the family"" and probably murderers themselves.

Vito's family has a hierarchical power structure. At the top is the first-born, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan), hot-headed and vengeful, with a lust for power - he is inverse of the collected and methodical Vito. Then there is Fredo (John Cazale), the ambitious but ultimately incompetent son who is more interested in women and booze than the family business. Finally there is Michael (Al Pacino) - the youngest son who is clearly the central character throughout the film.

Michael is a young World War II veteran who wants no part in his father's business. His signature line is ""That's my family, Kay it's not me."" He respects his father more than any other man, but he wants to live a different line. He is a dynamic, fully-realized character that is absolutely convincing. He is also a very different character at the end of the film - but in a way that is completely consistent with his personality.

The film has an excellent pace. There is an ebb and flow - the film begins rather slowly, then picks up the pace, and rises to the climax of the first act - and then the pace slows once more, only to build up suspense again to a final climax, in which all loose ends are neatly tied. Never is the audience bored - the story keeps a tight grip on the viewer, ensuring that they wonder as to the fates of the characters even in the slowest parts - a remarkable accomplishment in of itself.

The Godfather is a excellent film in every sense of the word - technically, aesthetically, in terms of story and characters, themes and music. It immerses the audience in a completely different - yet perhaps altogether to familiar - world. It is a classic that is - and will be - rooted in film history."

10,Classic,This film is so amazing! The greatest movie of all time.
10,Timeless masterpiece,"Absolute masterpiece, an unforgettable mafia family saga."
10,Stunning Classic Movie,"1. Usually I ignore movies which have length of more than 1.5-2 Hours.

2. But this movie made me realize the importance of movie length.

3. From there on I never miss such movie length 4. Must Watch Title 5. It has all you need."
10,The Greatest Movie For Ever,The most complete film in the history of cinema The actors perform best in their roles Memorable soundtrack A full-fledged film for all generations A true masterpiece A complete collection of audio-visual beauties.
10,must watch this movie,"This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.

""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
10,Masterful Craftsmanship,"As both a director and a screenplay writer, reviewing ""The Godfather"" from 1972 is an opportunity to delve into one of the most masterfully executed films in cinematic history. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the film is a sprawling tale of family, power, and the transformations wrought by ambition and loyalty.

From a directorial standpoint, Coppola's vision for ""The Godfather"" is nothing short of visionary. The meticulous attention to period detail, the use of lighting to convey mood and emotion, and the masterful staging of scenes combine to create a palpable sense of time and place. The opening wedding scene alone is a masterclass in storytelling, introducing a multitude of characters and relationships through seamless interactions that feel both authentic and significant. Coppola's use of close-ups and long takes draws viewers deeper into the world of the Corleone family, creating an intimacy that is both compelling and unsettling.

As a screenplay writer, the narrative structure and character development in ""The Godfather"" serve as exemplary models. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is a testament to the power of adaptation, transforming the novel's rich narrative into a tight, focused exploration of Michael Corleone's evolution from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mob boss. The dialogue is iconic, imbued with a weight and realism that resonate long after the film ends. Phrases like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" have entered the cultural lexicon, demonstrating the screenplay's impact.

The performances, particularly those of Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael, are monumental. Brando's portrayal of the patriarch is nuanced and layered, communicating power and vulnerability in equal measure. Pacino's transformation over the course of the film is riveting, a testament to both the actor's skill and the screenplay's depth.

Moreover, the film's exploration of themes such as the corruption of the American Dream, the complexities of family loyalty, and the moral compromises inherent in the pursuit of power, is handled with nuance and sophistication. It's a narrative that invites reflection and debate, demonstrating the screenplay's depth and the directorial vision's capacity to provoke thought.

In conclusion, as a director and screenplay writer, I view ""The Godfather"" as a cornerstone of cinematic achievement. Its influence on film narrative, character development, and the craft of movie-making is indelible. It stands not only as a compelling family saga but as a profound commentary on power, morality, and the American psyche. ""The Godfather"" is a film that endures, its legacy a testament to the genius of its creators."
10,A great movie,A great movie and great acter and great directer a love this movie
10,The best film in the history,"Best film ever, amazing cast, Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation. The Godfather simultaneously along many roads: the socio-political analysis (the corruption of the authorities to the Cuban revolution), the Bildungsroman, the traditional gangster film, the protest film (especially in the third chapter), then go back where he started, more and more dark and bitter, closing in on itself. In full respect of the rules of tragedy, from the ancient Greeks to the New Hollywood. Ambassador of narrative classicism tinged cinefilia and spiced with personal experiences of its director, fascination with corruption and violence as inherent in the construction of power factors of both a family and a nation, conjunction of talents in adverse conditions with successful results and unexpected, the proof that even in the most unexpected place can wait a stainless classic, the Godfather is all that and the opportunity to see this in a movie theatre is a pending issue that many viewers or not viewers should have fulfilled."
5,"Slow,boring but still a good a movie","Yeah it's a good movie but I can't accept that this is regarded as the greatest film of all time...come on...there are a lot of films which is worth enough to reign the crown of being the greatest film of all time such as Shawshank redemption, Schindler's list and much more...but seriously cannot accept that this one is the best film of all time... whatever.... there's nothing much to say...but I really appreciate Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's performance it was actually great... that's all I wanna say."
10,Godfather startup!,"The Godfather movie has been reviewed from different perspectives and maybe this work of art is considered one of the masterpieces of cinema, but what has attracted my attention is the Godfather's business! An attractive idea with a business plan and a unique operational plan to create wealth and provide business security in innovative and new ways so that it can be inspired as a unique model for business development, how to manage members The group, keeping trade secrets, market development, audience analysis and how to deal with the law and interacting with society are only part of these issues that can be carefully considered, so I suggest you watch this movie from this angle.

Mohammad jafar."
10,Incredible,"It;s either ""Boring and far too long"" or ""The best film ever!"". The crucial factor in these two opinions of 'The Godfather' is...intelligence. The Godfather is an intricate, clever, brilliantly scripted movie. Those of us who have the brains to understand it see its beauty, those who dont, cant. Its only downfall is that it is possibly too clever for all to enjoy which is a shame."
10,Fantastic movie,"Movie is all awesome and having a many good scenes which are also so much impressing, where ever other are just making the same thing and going or repeating again and again but this is what I call movie. Even every single is having a good quality of new moves and that makes your movie different from other creations. Keep going on and bring us a lots of good innovative ideas."
9,Must watch!,"I'm not one to watch old movies because the quality bothers me, but this is worth it. Great movie."
10,The Godfather,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

It should be noted that The Godfather was the first gangster/mobster movie I had ever seen. I was 17 years old when I first saw it and it blew me away. Francis Ford Coppola transports you into the world of the Corleone family. He masterfully introduces use the memorable characters and settings that become classics in cinema history. The story is full of twists that you stunned and the flow of the film is elegant and graceful.

The acting is masterful. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and many others all perform perfectly. They all add to story and are all unique. They are some of the best characters in cinema.

The pacing is perfect. Coppola takes his time creating his characters and settings. The runtime is very long but I found it to go by rather quickly because of the interesting and intense story.

Pros: Masterful storytelling, memorable characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good runtime

Cons: None

Overall Rating: 10"
10,godfather,"Godfather is the name of most popular , classic , handsome movie of the all the time that produced"
10,The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made.,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 48 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
10,10/10,This movie was amazing it shows viewers the dynasty of the badass mafia crew who showed their audience the meaning of brotherhood and loyalty as they were faced with challenges throughout the film.
7,Beautiful,Amazing film and the shot was cinematic. I love to watch always.
10,Amazing,"Perhaps no other film comes so close to perfectly depicting the lifestyle of the early mafia. It's flawless in it's execution, takes its time to let the story unfold properly, then builds the tension to maximum effect and allows the viewer to feel what that lifestyle must feel like when it all comes crashing down. So many amazing quotes, so many amazing images. Perhaps surpassed only by installment 2 (in this critic's eyes), there aren't many movies better made."
10,Makers and characters of this movie lives forever in art of film making,"Finally i decided to give review on the most popular,role model movie in the world,even though mine would be lost in millions of reviews.Mario Puzo has created this story based on characters with underworld platform.Father,his three sons and one foster son.

Santinno-Angry Fredo-coward Michael-cool,smart

Vito(father)-mixture of these characters,and treats everyone equally with love and care.And of course Tom hagen,the foster son plays lawyer with cool head and has good,comfortable place in the story.The content is completely extracted from the novel,so all credits to Mario Puzo in forming the basement of this movie.

Francis Ford Copolla not much known director at that point of making this movie has done great in transforming all his passions,talent for this masterpiece.His passion on art of film making is evident in the quality and execution of this movie.Introduced many trend like darkness in back drop,natural on acting(tongue slip of words remain unedited)

The content of this movie is little complicated but has international appeal due to the characters,emotion,conversation and family values.The acting of Marlon Brando,Alpacino and the complete team deserve all appreciation.The character of Alpacino is fascinating and i guess most would become his fans after watching this movie.

The background music for the movie enhances beauty of this artistic movie.Ultimately we can say all forms of art acting,writing,music were at its best in this movie.The movie runs for 3hours,little long but the content justifies it.

Why do i praise this movie so much,WATCH it.This movie will make you an offer which you cant refuse!!!"
9,"Cinematic perfection, why not 10/10?","The Godfather is one of maybe 3 or 4 of those 'perfect movies'. The ones where no matter how many times you watch it, you can't nit-pick anything wrong, unnecessary, even if your life depended on it. It has an amazing story, incredible (and subtle) acting, great cast overall, and it is consistently gripping for the 3-hour run time. There is no trace of any laziness or mistake.

So why shouldn't I give this a perfect rating while we're at it? Well, two reasons mainly.

The first is universal: Despite it's Cinematic perfection, the way I see a perfect movie is if no one hated it. If ANY human being watched this movie from start to finish, they would be on the edge of their seat for 178 minutes (and I mean ANYONE who watched this, not one person left behind). It seems a little like splitting hairs if one person would lean back for a second and no longer calling this movie 'perfect', but when I hear that word, I expect people to mean what they say. And judging from the few hateful reviews I've seen on this one, it just doesn't quite make the cut.

Second, I would be one of those people who happened to sit back for a portion of the movie, mostly after Don Vito came back from the gunshot scene. I was thrilled and angry at the same time, but seeing as how he went on with business as before, I figured it was a break in the movie for everyone to re-cap so far. Bottom line, I got lost a little after that.

Again, if the Godfather were perfect, then it would have a prefect 10/10 overall rating as well, and not the 9.2 it currently has. Still, I recommend anyone who likes movies to watch this one. It will most likely be worth your while."
10,Very good movie,"Unbelievable this movie, is incredible, all the movie."
10,A true masterpiece.,"Masterpiece is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but this movie truly lives up to that title."
8,A proper mafia film,"This movie is MORE deserving of the spot held by Shawshank on this site as the best movie of all time. The film was rather concise, leaving the viewer with a desire for more. The main character, bizarre voice aside, was a character that is easy to get attached too, both in part to the well written script, and on point acting. A classic movie everyone should see. I am glad to have a movie in the top 5 that is an example of nearly unanimous support."
6,The Godfather creates a CGI live-action movie,"In September 5, 2018, was released the CGO live-action movie."
9,Best ever movie,"One of the best ever movies i watched, wish to have same movies now a days"
10,Mind-blowing,I have watched this movie more than 30 times and every time i watch this excellent movie i am amzed.
10,Movie Review: The Godfather.,"*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.

Movie Review: The Godfather.

I'm starting to catalog the movies and series I've seen from scratch, and pay attention Connie, this is the only time I'm going to give you any explanations about my business. This is a layman's critique. I usually won't have great criteria when doing an analysis. Here I write as a spectator, who likes movies and that's all, giving only my opinion, based on absolutely nothing.

I thought a lot about which movie I would choose to be the first. It would have to be an odd movie to say the least, and I found it.

A film considered by many to be the best work ever made in the seventh art, The Godfather is a work of many layers, but I don't intend to go on too long.

The work has several aspects, which work very well, and several movie moments that are interspersed and talk to each other, causing the viewer different emotions throughout the film.

A very long film, with its story embedded in the film from start to finish. In short, this density of history requires the viewer to pay close attention, so as not to miss any details. Of all aspects such as the strong figure of Don Corleone, the family history that is tied up during the film, I believe that the most relevant aspect to deal with here is what is really at stake: The construction of the Godfather, who is Michael .

In my view, this film portrays this character construction as being the godfather, and I suppose and hope that part II and III are respectively the middle and end of his story. If not, anyway, that was the clear impression the film gave me.

For all the zeal and care I've seen in this film, and also for the fact that it's very old and so well built in every way, I allow myself to give this film full marks, hoping I don't get used to pushing that button too often.

It's not business, it's personal.

Rating: 5/5 - This film is a Masterpiece."
10,nice movie,"Hi, i am CEO from new brand company. Now i want starting Valuable info for working. I enjoy with your article, please keep itu happy writing!"
8,Never take sides against the family.,"One of the greatest films of all time, a true masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, as well as the film that established the standard.

In the story, the Mafia is seen from within. That is its secret, allure, and spell; it has shaped how the general public perceives the Mafia ever since. In place of the real world, there is an authoritarian patriarchy ruled by the Godfather, with betrayers as the only bad guys. Michael (Al Pacino) gave the following advice: ""Never take sides against the family."" The Godfather traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh."
9,Movie to watch,"Recently saw this movie, liked it. A bit long but keeps you involved throughout. Al and Marlon are phenomenal. To me the best part of the series."
10,Excellent Movie,One of my favourite movie of all time!! I really enjoy the role of Marlon Brando.
7,_,"The scriptwriter and the performance of the magic of the numerous strokes, can be found in ""The Godfather"" to the audience ""big screen"" experience is enough to refute those who oppose."
5,Mafia and gangs wasn't my thing but,"Mafia and gangs wasn't my thing but I decided to watch it for changing, and with all these reviews I expected something will make my head blow. I would say it's not that different from other gangs movies so .."
10,Words are not enough !!,"everyone knows its one of the best movie. but you don't know is this is the movie that comes once in the history... its made me think like i am the godfather. i am the MOB !! you can not say if the actors are acting... its real..

missing this art, should be considered as a self-disgrace. i don't know what the associates got into them, and if that is normal or spiritual (if there is) but surely it is something that can not me done again.. thanks to everyone to giving one audience this much of peace and something beyond words ..

THANK YOU !!"
10,en iyi film,"The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces in cinema history. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film masterfully explores themes of family, power, and betrayal. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino deliver iconic performances, portraying the grandeur and darkness of the mafia world. With its gripping narrative, unforgettable lines, and haunting score, the movie takes viewers on a profound journey. Michael Corleone's character arc, in particular, unfolds like a tragic epic. Every scene is meticulously crafted, making it a pinnacle of both technical and storytelling excellence, earning its place as ""the greatest film of all time"" in the eyes of many."
8,This encourage me always to make film,"I love this movie, specially those are on 70s and 80s. I just love to go back on Analogue. Lets love films for mankind."
10,An unparalleled masterpiece,"Many reviews talk about the genius evidenced in this masterpiece of ""gangster"" movies. Of course, it really is a family movie, with a story set in the gangster world. What can I add that has not been said already? The simple fact that this classic captures the family dynamic that is practically gone from movies of the last 20 years.

The movie does not drown in schmaltz or sappy emotion. The love of the sons for the Godfather is natural and understandable. We can all identify with loving someone so much that we would be willing to die for them, or worse. The togetherness as well as the personal prejudices of the Corleone family (esp. Sonny) make the dynamic totally believable.

I loved this movie, and I can watch it over and over. In fact, I think I will!"
10,The Best Film of All Times,"The Godfather I-II is far the best film ever. It's the per excellence for cinema in terms of narrative, acting, technique, and visibility. Some might argue that it is nor revolutionary, for example, such as The Citizen Cane. I totally agree with that argument that the GodFather I-II is not revolutionary in terms of narrative and form. Yet, but what it perfectly does is to combine all the virtues and improvements of cinematography, and raise them to an advanced level. At its time, it seems it's the end of cinema in terms of perfection. Moreover, it paved the way for the emergence of a new breed of actors such as Robert DE Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Taila Shire, Diane Keaton. It made Robert Duvall a power player in Hollywood Cinema, and gave a legend, Marlon Brando a chance to make an honorable leave that he unfortunately did fail to use. Regarding direction, Coppola set the standards for perfect directing.

I was born in 1975, that is to mean, I did not remember 70s but as I started to watch films and became an aficionado for films, I realized that only the Godfather I-II is enough to call '70s' as the best decade of modern cinema."
10,good movie,This is my best favorite movie. i saw this movie when i was a boy. I dont remember how many time i watch this movies
10,Better and Better,Each time I watch this I fall deeper in love. Brilliant.
1,Worst movie ever,"First i thought that The men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this..... VERY bad movie. I don't care how many people gave it a 10 (don't know why). I want to write my opinion. It is long, boring, a lot of talking, a lot families, names, doing ""buissnes"".... Did i mention that it is boring? The movie lacks a good storyline. It doesn't matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all. There is no comedy, there is very little action, drama (here and there somebody gets killed). I had better fun watching politicians than this.

I just wasted 6 hours of my life. (together with the second part)

Better watch Scarface, Casino or Reservoir Dogs. My other movies are Braveheart, Gladiator, Shawshank, Lethal weapon, Black hawk down...."
10,The Best Mafia Movie Of All Time!!!,"Actually The Godfather Is The Reference Movie For Many Gangster and Mafia Movies Produced Nowadays Although Its Too Old But it Takes You Through Every Aspect Of The Mafia families And How They The Make The Deals , Its A Comprehensive Movie Takes You Through Everything You Need To Know About Mafia Life And Especially The Italians , I really enjoy This Movies Although Its Too Long But You Wont Be Bored Watching it as you will Be Curious What Will Be Next, I Think That AL Pacino Role Were Very Good , Actually For People who Are Less Than 18 Cannot Watch It because It Has Bad Language And Violence Scenes."
10,"The ""Godfather"" of the cinema","This movie deserves the best score and the best reviews. No one could ever represent the world of mobsters better than Coppola did. Every single character, or almost everyone, is represent and told in every single aspect: his life, his emoticons, his role in the family (the apoteosis of mobsters families of all time). The movie succeeds in being very intersting and always exciting, altough very long. A piece of history, the perfettina!"
8,Great great Godfather,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola!"
10,The Godfather,"The film is a must see, anyone who has not yet seen it is missing out on the true beauty of film making. This film has deserved all of the awards it received. Marlon Brando plays an excellent role as Don Vito Corleone, and along with Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. They both fit their parts perfectly! The first time I saw it I was blown away by the acting. Marlon Brando especially, his character's voice really makes him unique and fun to watch. Al Pacino is a war hero and the youngest son of three, he comes home for his sister Connie's wedding. And the godfather's daughter's wedding day is the most important to him. Like said, this movie is a must see and I highly encourage everyone who has not seen it to see it as soon as possible, classic movies like these never get old."
10,This movie is one you can't refuse,"I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it for the first time about a week ago and have not been able to stop thinking about it since. The acting of both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is simply phenomenal. Pacino's never-changing serious demeanor perfectly conveys the life of a mobster. One can almost feel bad for Brando's 'Vito Corleone'. He is displayed as an old man who loves his family and will do anything to make sure they thrive rather than a ruthless killing machine. There is violence, but it's not over-the-top gore. It's all done in good taste. I found this movie to be very interesting because I know next-to-nothing about the Mafia. True, this movie is long at almost 3 hours but it's worth it. Now, to mention the music. I thought the music was truly beautiful and timeless. It perfectly captures the essence of the movie. . I've had the theme song stuck in my head for days now. At times my heart was beating fast for the characters out of suspense. I cried when they cried. I really felt some of the deaths. Overall, I feel as though this movie rightly deserves the title of 'Greatest Movie Ever Made'. I could watch this movie over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a timeless classic and, currently, my favorite movie."
10,Breathtaking although not the greatest mob film,"This movie had me speechless by the end. In this movies there are no errors,no mistakes, everything is perfection. It is perfect in every aspect of the movie. It boosted Pacino to stardom along with a Dog Day Afternoon. It is Francis Ford Copollas greatest classic alongside Apocalypse now. This movie has a great story line and shows what its really like to be in a mob family down to the very last detail. No part of this movie is wrong and the views of the mob are correctly viewed. This movie is an all-time classic. I would not consider it the greatest mobster movie as i feel Good Fellas is but it is perfect and could not have been done better by a perfect director. I give this movie an amazing 10 out of 10."
8,It Was Amzing,So happy to watch this Movie............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
7,very good movie,"good was a very good movie i enjoyed it a lot

good story line will still watch the sequels. Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
10,The Best Film Ever Made,"I have always been a sucker for mafia movies and ""Goodfellas"" has always been my favorite but I now must change my mind. I have seen The Godfather now about ten times or so and the movie grows on me more each time I watch it. I pick up little things that I didn't notice every time and to me the movie gets better and better each time as well. The storyline changes so much and I hardly notice that it is three hours long. I would have to say that I don't think there will ever be a film that could ever come close to The Godfather. They just don't make them like they used to."
10,GOOD 1900 MOVIE ALL THE TIME!!!,"Visually, The Godfather is stunning. The film's cinematography, by Gordon Willis, is famous for its use of shadows and muted colors, creating a sense of foreboding that permeates every scene. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is equally iconic, with its haunting theme music perfectly capturing the tragic grandeur of the Corleone family's story.

However, The Godfather is not without its challenges. The film's deliberate pacing and complex plot can be daunting for some viewers, particularly those accustomed to more fast-paced, action-oriented films. At nearly three hours long, it demands a level of commitment and attention that not everyone may be willing to give. Additionally, the film's portrayal of violence and its glorification of the Mafia lifestyle have been criticized, though it's clear that Coppola is more interested in exploring the moral complexities of his characters than in glamorizing their actions.

In conclusion, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place in the pantheon of great films. It's a richly layered, meticulously crafted story about power, family, and the corrupting influence of ambition. While its slow pace and lengthy runtime may not appeal to everyone, those who invest the time will be rewarded with a film that is as thought-provoking as it is visually and emotionally impactful. The Godfather is more than just a crime drama; it's a profound exploration of the human condition, and its influence on cinema is undeniable."
10,Inspirational,"The best cinematic version while being a thorough watcheye & never to be missed , that this piece of art is totally ethereal. It was 5 am in the morning and , I was going through my high and lows of paternal historical silence that made me feel like dwelling to search on something that can portrait god parents , whereby Godfather - title in itself was so ebullient. That's totally worth watching and indulgence of such masterpiece can't be left in spaces. Never too late for a bounded inspirational movies like where we can articulate our thoughts , feeling and in-facts morals too. The God Father is must watch."
10,One of the greatest movies ever,The Godfather is one of if not the most perfect movie ever made. The acting is phenomenal Marlon Brando and Al Pacino deserve the highest praise for their roles in this movie. The story is a bit slow at first there is a lot going on in the begining but it soon speeds up and get really exciting. Some of the best quotes are from this movie and some of the best scenes too. What is crazy about this movie is 50 years later it is still relevant and is still just as popular as it was back in 1972. The movie is timeless and will never not be popular. The score is also amazing here the theme song is so good as well.
10,An absolute staple in film,"The screen writing and cinematography are absolutely incredible for their time and still is today. The way the movie flows just works and the characters have such well, thought out backgrounds and how they interact with each other. Between the protagonist and antagonists of the story plot, it all just worked out well."
6,God Father,"The Godfather is an undeniable cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences more than 50 years after its release. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this epic tale of family, power, loyalty, and betrayal sets the standard for what a crime drama should be.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary. His commanding presence, coupled with his nuanced performance, defines the character as one of the most iconic figures in film history. Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, undergoes a fascinating transformation, evolving from an outsider to the ruthless head of the Corleone family. The chemistry between the actors, especially in pivotal scenes like the wedding and Michael's eventual rise, is nothing short of extraordinary.

The film's screenplay, written by Puzo and Coppola, is brilliant, filled with sharp dialogue and deep moral complexity. It explores the theme of power and its corrupting influence on individuals and families. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is stunning, with its dark and atmospheric lighting complementing the film's somber tone.

The pacing is impeccable, building tension at just the right moments while allowing the audience to appreciate the intricate family dynamics. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is haunting and unforgettable, becoming as synonymous with the story as the characters themselves.

The Godfather is not just a film about organized crime, but about family loyalty, sacrifice, and the American Dream. It is a timeless work of art that has influenced countless filmmakers and remains one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven't yet experienced it, prepare to witness the brilliance that has shaped the landscape of cinema."
1,"Great film, but it's nothing compared to Foodfight.","Godfather, more like, Cringefather. It is a film that is good, but cannot compare to the horror masterpiece that is Foodfight."
10,"This movie is made for MEN, not for kids.","Till watching this movie I was confused which is the best movie I have seen, but after watching this movie I got answer that this is not only my favorite but also world's best movie ever made.

There are many characters in movie so people get confused and say movie was boring. Actually they don't understand the deepness of characters. Also there are many people who said ""we liked this movie at second watch"" because at first watch they did not adjust themselves with many movie characters. There are many characters and every character has his/her story. Story of movie is flawless and exceptional. Dialogues of movie are still considered as best movie dialogues in film industry. Everyone appreciated acting of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, but acting by James Caan (Sonny), John Cazale (Fredo), Diane Keaton (Kay), Richard Costellano (Clemenza) and also Sollozzo, Carlo Rizzi, Connie were also very good. Direction was also very good. Also watch the style of actors, watch when Brando moves his hand for signifying that give water to Bonasera. Also watch Pacino's acting in the restaurant, like he was hurt from inside and would do anything to save the attempt on his father or family. Movie is based on book written by Mario Puzo. I have also read the book and it is also very good and flawless like movie. And listen the music given by Nino Rota, masterpiece. The best thing of movie is Michael was innocent boy who didn't want to mix up in his family business, but when danger things come to your family , you have to take the commands, forget everything and save your family. And last thing I want to add is, if you don't get the movie in first watch, don't comment anything, watch the movie second time, understand the characters. You will like the movie. And 9.2 is less ratings, movie deserves 9.5 or more. It deserves first place not second."
9,The Hollywood Family: Part 1,"Francis Ford Coppola's movie about the Corleone family is the story of the ultimate Hollywood family. Although ""The Godfather"" has lost some of it's original steam. In 1972 the causal treatment of violence was beyond shocking. With films like ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Goodfellas"" & ""Pulp Fiction"" (any Tarantino film for that matter) savage violence done in an ""every day life"" manner is no longer as shocking. Although there are a few scenes that stand out, even today. When Michael Corleone paid back those gentlemen for the attempted murder of his father. That is one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. And of course the scene were one of Mr. Ed's comrades makes a cameo. The most amazing thing to myself is how much of a family this really is. The Corleone's love each other, and that shines through above everything else in this film. But even with all it's greatness it lasted too long. So this great film just doesn't make the 10 cut for me. 9 (would be 9.8) out of 10."
8,"Overrated action movie, nothing more...","OK so The Godfather is an entertaining movie. OK, so it has some nice music, decent acting, and a gripping plot. All in all, I'm secure enough to state that it is an OK movie.

However, the fact that it is rated 9.2 out of 10, and on #2 spot in the top IMDb movie list requires some analysis. Deep analysis on this simple question: is this movie really better than the 100,000 or so other movies in IMDb? Better yet, is there something wrong with humanity if a movie about sick, violent, greedy, vengeful, hateful people gets a #2 spot?

My answer to this last question is, sadly, yes. Well, at least for the bulk of humanity: individually, there is no problem to rate this movie 10/10 (in fact, there is but hey, I'm putting it into perspective here), because it is fairly entertaining. But the fact that statistically it has been rated so high shows you about the sad and devious nature of people.

I, for one, have rated at least 200 movies higher than The Godfather, and I am proud of it, because I cannot convince myself that a film which tells you the story of people with the lowest possible moral can be one of the best I've seen. Main characters have to have at least a very small ray of humanity and decency in them for the movie to be really good (character depth), or else, it is just an average action movie, nothing more...

8/10"
10,Good film,"I watched the movie after reading the book a couple of times, so my viewing turned into another reading. Filmed very close to the text, and this once prevented me from enjoying the film itself to the fullest. I remember that as a child I took the book ""Seventeen Moments of Spring"" and compared it with the stems that they say in the film of the same name with Tikhonov. It turned out word for word and became uninteresting."
10,Not 1972 It will be 2018 - 2021 or 2048,I didn't get why The Shawshank Redemption is best movie in history. Because It made in 1994. But this THE GODFATHER smell like history and it deserves to be most movie in history of world.
10,The Godfather is not just a movie,"The Godfather is not just a movie; it's a cinematic experience that redefined the gangster genre and established itself as a timeless classic. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film blends intricate storytelling, deep character development, and intense drama in a way that few others have achieved. Set against the backdrop of a mafia family, it's more than a tale of crime-it's a meditation on power, loyalty, and family dynamics.

At its core is Marlon Brando's unforgettable portrayal of Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch of the Corleone family. His performance is both powerful and understated, bringing a quiet dignity to a character who's capable of ruthless decisions. Brando's ability to convey so much with just a glance or a whispered word elevates the role to iconic status. Al Pacino, playing Michael Corleone, is equally mesmerizing as the reluctant son who gradually descends into the family's world of organized crime. Watching Michael's transformation from a war hero into the new Godfather is one of the most compelling character arcs in cinema.

The film's pace is deliberately slow, giving each scene time to breathe and each character a chance to shine. Coppola masterfully uses this pace to build tension, especially in moments like the wedding sequence, where seemingly mundane events hint at deeper undercurrents of power struggles and family ties. This patience pays off in climactic scenes like the baptism juxtaposed with a series of brutal assassinations-a haunting depiction of Michael's full embrace of his new role.

The supporting cast, including James Caan as Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, add even more depth to the film. Each character is well fleshed out, adding layers to the story and reinforcing the sense that this is not just about crime, but about the personal cost of power.

Visually, The Godfather is stunning. Gordon Willis' cinematography, often called ""The Prince of Darkness,"" uses shadows and warm hues to create an atmosphere of both intimacy and menace. The haunting score by Nino Rota adds an extra layer of emotion, amplifying the tension, heartbreak, and inevitable downfall that permeates the film.

While The Godfather is filled with violent moments, it never feels gratuitous. Each act of violence has weight and consequence, serving the larger narrative and deepening our understanding of the characters' moral dilemmas.

Ultimately, The Godfather is a film about the American Dream and its darker side. It explores the lengths to which individuals will go to protect their family and legacy, often at the cost of their humanity. Even more than 50 years after its release, it remains relevant and continues to influence filmmakers and storytellers across genres.

It's not just a movie-it's an experience, a masterclass in filmmaking, acting, and storytelling. For anyone interested in the power of cinema to explore complex themes, The Godfather is essential viewing."
6,Nice Story,I Like the story of movie. fantastic naturalization of movie including sound in movie theater is very good.
1,History's most overrated film,"This film is a mafia version, but without the existential philosophical depth of The Brothers karamazov.

They took the structure of Dostoevsky's book, but without having the same depth, and set it in the mafia."
10,Amazing Movie - A Must Watch,"The acting sone in this movie is simply amazing! I am spellbound. What could be more appealing to people than watching such talented actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and lot more. This is like a complete package!"
10,No matter what I'm doing...if it's on TV..I'll sit and watch,"The first time I saw this movie in the theatre, I was 19, and so taken by it's theme, because there had been nothing like it before. That scene with ""horses' head"" in the movie exec's bed..was really great!!! I immediately asked my Italian friends, if that could be possible..... they said...""yes, in the 'old' days...not as many cops,and no forensic stuff available then to get caught!"" However, some things weren't realistic...such as...Michael's naive wife(Diane Keaton) constantly interfering(he would have gotten rid of her,long ago)and Sonny getting caught by himself, on the causway...you 'always' take somebody with you, (men can't avoid to be careless)... Anyway... a great film...a collectors' item..now for sure...."
10,like watchin willlie's catch,"Baseball and Film are among my passions. The soul craves seeing something done well. Even people who know nothing about baseball can look at Willie Mays catch in the 53 (not sure of the year) World Series and see that it is executed with perfection.

Every sence in this Movie has a kind of Mauysian Catch quality. In the first sence, we see a man sitting at a dek with a most grandfatherly deamonor petting a pussy cat. I first thought this was a deliberate attempt to make a statement he is so gentle yet a cold blooderd mobster. Legend has it however, that the cat came onto the set by accident and Brando (with the reflex of a Willie Mays) knew just what to do.

When Tom is kidnapped he is told ""If I wanted to kill you'd be dead alreardy"" we are reminded that murder is a natural as breathing.

From the time the undertaker begs for justice until the time Kay sees Micheal for a ruthless killer we see acting as good as the Sey Hey Kid could catch. To maintain this quality for a few sences is an achievement. To maintain it in every sence for well over two hours is an offer no one should refuse."
8,What a reference !,"Mafia Movies be my biggest influence, i have to say that i love when film start quick in action, thats not the case for this one, but when its started , its started ...

A must see"
9,The Godfather is a true cinematic,"The Godfather is a true cinematic gem that will forever remain in the history of cinema. A score of 9, in my opinion, cannot reflect the depth and skill of this film, but it is as an attempt to express my admiration and respect for it.

The film tells the story of the Corleone mafia family and their godfather, Vito Corleone, played by the unrivalled Marlon Brando. The superb screenplay, based on Mario Piuso's novel, allows the viewer to delve deeply into the world of crime, power and family values.

Director Francis Ford Coppola created an incredibly atmospheric film, combining drama, thriller and crime plot. Excellent acting, beautiful music by Nino Rota, skilful work with the camera and scenery - all this is perfectly combined in ""The Godfather"".

The film not only tells the story of a mafia family, but also touches on deep themes of morality, justice and family bonds. It's a story about human relationships, ambition and how power changes people.

I really enjoyed ""The Godfather"" and even though a score of 9 may seem insufficient, it is one of those films that leaves an unforgettable impression and that you think about for a long time after watching it. It is a classic film that is worth watching for all film lovers."
8,Welcome to the Family,"As what Marlon Brando says ""kiss my hand, call me your Godfather for justice...and friendship. This film is incredible, Francis's directing is justice to the film history. Marlon Brando is incredibly strong in his character. The blood is too graphic. The Score is beautifully mastered to the picture. God bless for ""The Godfather"" Especially, Al Pacino's acting is superb.

A mistake to this film...the deaths, the irony of the characters. Theme is good, but not great. Redemption, Trust, and Family. This Italian Mafia takes over New York and the rest of Hollywood. I love this film because of the death of James Caan's character, Sonny. Wow, the deaths in this film. There is one death, two deaths, even many deaths in the film that make the film incredible."
10,family,"Laying the foundation for the story, the translation takes a scriptwrit-like approach to presenting the story to the reader. The whole book is as steady and slow as an Italian opera."
7,Pretty realistic movie.,I like this movie for it's realness. It's really amazing how a gangster family fight to stay in their position.
5,Maybe in 1972 it was impressive.,"I mean come on... I have watched the movie for the first time as an adult in 2020 at 34 years old. I have seen so many better films. I don't get all the reviews, it's like they all belong in the past. I see nothing great in this movie."
10,Positive and effective effect of the film.,The body language as well as the character of the godfather of the film are included and we see his beautiful acting. This film shows the prestige of a powerful person and at the same time Badright.
9,This is a wonderful movie!!!!!,"The film gave me a very different feeling. Splitting the ""Godfather"" apart, each small piece is actually bland, but when these bland small pieces are combined together, they produce such a huge magic force. Real emotions are the foundation, there is no pretentiousness, no exaggeration. Just like our real life, people are very sensitive to reality."
10,Top One for me!,"Everyone does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
10,The greatest movie ever made.,"Francis Ford Coppola achieved perfection on film with this great work. He directs so subtly that he makes it seem simple. But watch the subtleness of the scene outside the hospital when Michael (Al Pacino, at his best) lights the cigarette of Enzo the baker. One quick shot of Michael's hands, and they aren't shaking, and we know that he was born for the family business. The great Marlon Brando ad-libbed the films most important scene, that in the garden with his grandson, as the Don dies in peace, ironic for a man that lived such a violent life. The moody cinematography of Gordon Willis is the best ever caught on film. And the score by Nino Rota (I know the Academy didn't believe it belonged entirely to Rota, but who cares what the Academy thinks?) is a classic. The rest of the cast, which includes Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Richard Conte, John Marley and Sterling Hayden is in top form. Every film and television show about the mafia since this one has borrowed or outright stolen from this film. It is a story of profound depth, an American tragedy, told in three acts, and this, the first act, is the best. And yet at its root, it is a very simple story, as Don Corleone prepares his children for the lives they will have to live and the world they will have to live in. It can be summed up as family values, mafia style."
10,Extraordinary,Superb I liked it everyone should watch it Movie gonna make your mind blast
10,Greatest Movie of all time?,"In my opinion, easily one of the top five movies of all time. I believe every person should sit down and watch not only this film, but the second and third ones as well.

Coppola and Puzo collaborated to create a beautiful artistic picture. Although an organized crime family is depicted, the real story is about family, and love. Michael's struggle is well documented, and as he attempts to stay away from the family business, his love for his father causes him to become a criminal as he attends to his father in the Don's greatest time of need.

As it turns out, Michael proved to be the ideal choice for the next Don, and now the story begins to unfold. The whole Godfather Saga chronicles one man's struggle to maintain his business but at the same time maintain his family.

A touching yet tragic saga about a likeable man."
6,summer time,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone. The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[7] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."
1,3 hours of boredom,"This is the 3rd time I watched this movie...and I always found it boring.

Today I watched it to see if it really was the best movie ever made...and no, it's not.

It's not the best...it's not the worst.

In reality 0 this is maybe a 4 or 5 or maybe a 6.

But to bring the score down from over a 9.5 to reality, I voted it a 1.

Not fantastic actors, not a fantastic script. Nothing mind blowing about this.

Lots of stuff didn't even make sense.

It drags on and on and the story barely comes to a close.

This movie is so far over-rated, it's sad really.

There are so many other better gangster mafia movies out there than this.

Not too violent, not too intense. Just really long and boring. Even for a 1970's movie, this is overly long and boring.

Goodfellas is far better and the Sopranos is also far better than this.

Highly over-rated."
10,Great Film (Even if a Tab Bit Overrated),"Five stars, but, possibly a slightly unpopular opinion: a bit over-rated. But... great acting, great script, great themes, lots of depth. The narrative is rich and complex, the characters are very memorable, and the performances by so many actors (from Al Pacino to Robert De Niro to James Caan) are iconic. The film's cinematography and attention to detail create an immersive atmosphere that pulls you into the world of the Corleone family. The score is haunting and perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing the emotional weight of key scenes. Additionally, the exploration of power, family loyalty, and moral conflict adds layers that make it worth rewatching and thinking about. Can't take stars off just because others have put this movie on a pedestal. Re-watch and discuss it every few years with my wife."
8,A great movie,The great movie one of the best mafia movies that ever made
10,My Favorite Film of all time.,"I just created an account and knew i had to review this movie first.

The Godfather is easily the most impressive movie because of the following: The directing is top notch,Coppola reveals his first masterpiece within an instant. The cast is Probably the best iv'e ever seen,which includes Brando,Pacino,Duvall,Caan,Keaton and many,many other great actors/actresses.The screenplay is very faithful to the book,proving adaptations can be perfect.Most of all the story itself,which for me never get boring to watch.Their really isn't a straight path story here,we have a movie that represents life in the 1940's as the crime families from each district confront their differences leading to a bunch of events that i won't get into. Overall this movie amazes me every time and iv'e seen at least a dozen times,each time better than the last. I have to give a personal thank you to Al Pacino,who is easily my favorite actor delivers one of the best performances to date.I cannot emphasize enough how perfect Al was for this role. To think they actually doubted him at first,wow just imagine him not in this movie is beyond me.

I love this movie half to death,if you haven't seen it and are a movie lover like i am you definitely need to Netflix/Buy this movie!!!!

10/10"
10,A classic crime movie,"This movie has really aged well . I'd watched it for the first time in 2010 ,38 years since it was filmed and i loved it . The movie has a lot of characters and it'll be hard to remember all of them so to get the real gist of the movie you have to rewatch a couple of time . But it's worth it . It's one of the best movies ever made in my opinion ."
10,Masterclass of a film,"Review of ""The Godfather""

Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" released in 1972, is a cinematic masterpiece that has secured its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, this epic crime drama captivates audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and profound exploration of power, family, and morality within the Mafia underworld of 1940s and 50s America.

At the heart of ""The Godfather"" is the Corleone crime family, led by the iconic Don Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando's portrayal of the aging patriarch is nothing short of legendary, capturing both the ruthless determination and tender familial love that define the character. His raspy voice and imposing presence command every scene he is in, making Don Vito a figure of both fear and admiration.

Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, the youngest son who initially wants nothing to do with his family's criminal enterprises. Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader is portrayed with subtle intensity, showcasing his character's moral descent as he becomes increasingly embroiled in the world of organized crime.

The supporting cast is equally exceptional, with James Caan as the hotheaded Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as the pragmatic Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Michael's innocent wife, Kay Adams. Each actor brings depth and complexity to their roles, adding layers to the intricate web of relationships and betrayals that drive the narrative forward.

Coppola's direction is masterful, employing a deliberate pace that allows the characters and their motivations to unfold naturally. The film's cinematography, by Gordon Willis, is striking, using shadow and light to heighten the drama and emphasize the moral ambiguity of the characters' actions. The score, composed by Nino Rota, is hauntingly beautiful, underscoring the film's emotional weight and dramatic tension."
10,From my favorite movie,"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed"
6,Most overrated movie ever,"I've never been so bored in my life like when i watched this movie. I started watching it with a big expectations due to what people say about it . But at the end, i ended up forcing my self to finish it. maybe because it's too old ? i don't know. The only good thing was the acting for sure. The main actor was a phenomenon."
1,Massive bullshit,"Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young."
9,Godfather 1972 are separated with 2020 dark-side world.,"Without undue emphasis, it shows the closeness, the warmth of family ties. The scenes are filled with wives and squalling babies, festive weddings and equally festive funerals, spaghetti prepared in the kitchen. There is the flavor of Italian home life that few gangster films have attempted. At the same time, there is also a specificity in the persona that few films have dared.

Which crooner was separated from whose orchestra on a friendly suggestion from the Godfather? And which movie producer was induced to hire him for a war movie by finding the head of his favorite horse in bed with him one morning? (Here, literary hyperbole may have embellished the facts, but it makes an effective, blood-curdling scene.)"
10,The greatest movie ever made,"This is a masterpiece! The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history ever. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you to see this movie. This movie is very strong, very good script, great casting, excellent acting, and of course great directing. I love this movie!"
10,COMPLEX MASTERPIECE!,"If you want to write something about this movie, either you write a complete separate novel, to express everything, or you just write 6 words: One Of The Best Movies Ever! But not the best movie for Marlon Brando. No, there is no ""Apocalypse Now"" neither! By far Brando is much better in: ""Morituri"" (1965), ""Candy"" (1968) and, absolutely phenomenal (especially in the scene when he's talking to his wife's dead body) in ""Last Tango in Paris""(1972). All the other actors are super exceptional: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Morgana King (Mother Corleone). But, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie is Al Lettieri in the role of Sollozzo."
10,best movie ever made,"the godfather is the best movie i had ever seen.I don't know how many times i watch this movie,maybe 20 or more. I think all the film lovers must see the film. Marlon Brando was excellent as godfather,but i like Alpacino most. His transformation from civilian to underworld don was terrific,and i cant imagine anybody else in the role of Michael. I don't know why he did not awarded an academy award for his portrayal of Michael . That's why i don't like academy awards. Tom Hagen is also very good. I liked the way Coppola directed it,as a lengthy movie i never get bored. I also watched THE GODFATHER part2, also a great movie and THE GODFATHER part3,which was not so bad as many says. Undoubtedly THE GODFATHER part1 is my best movie and i will never stop watching it."

10,The Greatest!,"Perhaps the greatest movie ever made. Growing up i watched this movie more than a hundred times, and still.. never ceases to amaze me.

The honor and morality of ruthless kilers, the cold and in the same time warm atmosphere. The clash between the top actors (Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall) and the newcomers (Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, John Casale, James Caan). This movie is a school in acting and directing, and a pure sample of how a flawless movie should be.

Everything perfect."
10,best top250,This movie deserves first place to the end.definitely not second place.
10,Best of the best,"Just a legendary movie with legendary actors.

The movie match so well with the book! Marlon Brando is a his best !"
8,A Classic,You can not have seen this movie its such a classic.
9,This classic inferior to GoodFellas.,"The Godfather Part I deserves to be seen for what it is, not what its reputation is or what Part II added to it. With that in mind, my review: The first 2 hours are rather aimless, shabbily edited to look like a discordant bunch of too-thoughtfully-crafted ""moments"" without a common center. The actors' portrayals, while very strong throughout the cast, frequently overshadow what they are talking about. I tend to think that the story is usually the most important and interesting part of films, but here it is put on the backburner by, dare I say, too rich character-development. Actually, is that what it was? I come away from it without any true understanding of Michael's motivations or concept of morals, or why he chose to totally ignore them in the pursuit of power. I often felt that Don Corleone himself, who is not in the film as much as one might expect, is also hidden behind his own famous mannerisms and the reputation that goes along with being the Godfather. Having said that, the last hour, with Michael as the new head of the family, finally gains a focus and becomes interesting. The cross-cutting of the christening and the murders was perfectly masterful and thrilling. However, how the film morphed into Michael's story (and how he himself morphed into the cold blooded killer) is rather abrupt and unconvincing, though I am grateful for the change in tone.

Most importantly, it is inferior to GoodFellas, and thus can't even stake a claim as the best film of its genre."
3,this movie no good,"I waste money on no good film. I write now because I mad. All talking, no thing else, very boring. I like alien vs. hunter better.

9,like,"The characters are numerous, the story is huge, the structure is flexible, the composition is exquisite. The essence of a movie is the art of telling a story. In a limited time, it is vivid and full to tell a complete story. In a movie, you can see the life of others, and it seems that you have finished your own life."
10,Excellent in every aspect,"I truly loved The Godfather and I'm 14. The movie is absolutely hard to dislike, ex. great acting, great dialogue, great way of ending the film. I can't believe this film got only 3 Academy Awards. It deserved a lot better than that. James Caan should have won Best Supporting Actor. He was excellent as he was aggressive. Yes, this is the greatest film of all time, better than Citizen Kane, which was a very good movie as well. What I most loved about The Godfather is that it is completely original and unforgettable. If you don't like it, ""I'll give you an offer you can't refuse."" Ha, ha."
10,Loved it,Greatest movie for it's time. Make an offer I can't refuse.
10,overrated you say?,"Nope. It is, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made. It has everything you ask for in a movie. It has drama, action, comedy, etc. It has it all. The best thing of all might be the one that holds it together, the story. I remember watching this when I was younger. Although I liked it then, I love it now. It gets better after each viewing. It is not for everyone though.

I know some people that do not like it. The reason is because it's not their kind of movie. Some cannot sit through it because of the length, and others because of the lack of non stop action. These things do not bother me. If you love watching movies, then I highly recommend this one.

Hands down this movie deserves a rating of 10/10.

9,I am amezed to see the explanation of this movie,"Mainly I have understood this by reading the imdb of the movie Francis Ford Coppola's *The Godfather* (1972) is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the gangster genre and remains one of the greatest films of all time. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film follows the powerful Corleone crime family, led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), as they navigate the treacherous world of organized crime. At its core, the film is about power, loyalty, and the moral decay of those who seek control. The story revolves around Vito's reluctant son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who transforms from an innocent outsider to a ruthless mafia boss. Brando delivers a legendary performance as the aging patriarch, his mannerisms and gravitas making Vito Corleone an iconic character. Pacino's portrayal of Michael's gradual descent into the mafia underworld is equally remarkable, capturing the nuances of his internal conflict. The supporting cast, including James Caan as Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, adds depth to the narrative, making the Corleone family feel authentic and complex. Coppola's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and emotion. Gordon Willis's cinematography uses shadow and lighting to enhance the film's dark, brooding atmosphere, while Nino Rota's haunting score adds to its emotional weight. The film's pacing allows the audience to absorb its themes without feeling rushed, making every moment impactful. One of the film's greatest strengths is its exploration of family and power, showing how personal choices can lead to inevitable consequences. Michael's journey is both tragic and compelling, as he sacrifices his morality for the sake of the family. The film also delves into themes of loyalty and betrayal, with characters making difficult decisions that test their allegiances. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" becoming part of pop culture. Violence is used sparingly but effectively, making each act of brutality feel consequential rather than gratuitous. The famous baptism scene, where Michael consolidates his power while renouncing sin in a church, is a brilliant juxtaposition that highlights the duality of his character. The Godfather is more than just a gangster film; it is a deeply human story about ambition, family, and the corrupting influence of power. Its influence on cinema is immeasurable, inspiring countless films and directors. Even decades after its release, it remains a gold standard for storytelling, acting, and filmmaking."
10,great movie,"an amazing movie everyone should see it takes you on a journey. the characters are played amazingly. as well the action scenes keep you looking forward to the next climax. this movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. i am sitting in my computer science class right now writing this review this movie is so damn good i risked getting in trouble to write this review! everybody should watch this and even show there kids forget about the swearing and blood show the kids the movie, proper grammar? who needs that for a review of such a phenomenal movie. if you are looking for something similar watch the Godfather part 2 because it is very very very VERY similar. hope you enjoyed and show your kids the movie!:)"
6,wow,This movie really suprised me and I enjoyed it and it was really enyoible. But u could change a few things but its good
1,I'll never understand,". . . why this movie gets such high ratings. It's a great story, but Coppola's criminal lack of attention to detail and continuity is insulting and Talia Shire's, James Caan's, Marlon Brando's and Diane Keaton's amateurish performances are distracting and laughable. Neither of them can act at all. Watch it again and I'm sure you'll agree."
9,The Godfather - Almost as Good as Godfather II,"Saying this film is almost as good as Godfather II is not a knock in any way. It is a great film. It is like comparing a BMW with a Mercedes. Both are great luxury cars, and both have several million diehard fans; just as this film and Godfather II have their admirers. I personally prefer Godfather II and a BMW. But back to the film. Brando is great, Pacino is great, Caan is intense, Keaton is good, Shire is good, and Duvall is perfect in his role. This was before napalm was invented, though. The story is riveting, and every scene is a masterpiece of filmmaking. I particularly enjoyed when Caan beat up his brother in law. I never had male in-law problems like that. However, I could have used Caan for one of mother in laws. A film for the ages."
10,Real Drama,This is been excellent and favorite movie all the time. Mr. Francis done really a great in the history of cinematography. First opening scene has revealed the outstanding performance of Mr. Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was absolutely amazing in his young age. This movie set the dimension of a underworld trend setter movie.
10,This Movie Will be The Best Movie Ever In My Life,"Love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
10,Smart human,A wise woman does not expose a man's lies. A wise man does not let a woman know she is lying.
10,Best film ever made,"I don't really know what to add to the reviews of this film to make my review worth reading. The Godfather is a so well done, masterfully crafted film that deserves to be the Top 1 film in IMDB. Well it's not that far since it's ranking n. 2 as of now. I am a film lover and I have watched some amazing movies, many good ones, but also too many that disappointed me. I can honestly say that The Godfather is far beyond being amazing. The Godfather stands out in many ways: acting, cinematography, directing, soundtrack, story and of course production design, which is flawless. I've watched it 3 times and I know that, soon enough, I will watch it again."
9,Best of 70s,"One of the best master piece by ""Francis Ford Coppola"", Desevrs the best Rating ever. It gives Marlon Brando the new name. Al Pacino as his best. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando, whose iconic performance has overshadowed an even better turn by Al Pacino as his son Michael) is a man for whom family is all. ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,"" he says, and he lives by that. He's devoted to his wife, dotes on his children and grandchildren, throws a lavish wedding for his daughter, and kills or threatens anyone who gets in his way or that of his family and friends. His sons are all in the family business, which includes union racketeering and gambling."
9,Who's being naive Kay?,"The Godfather is an iconic film that has captivated audiences for decades, and it's hard to overstate its influence on cinema. The performances are one of the film's most remarkable aspects. The casting feels flawless, with each actor embodying their character so deeply that it's difficult to imagine anyone else in those roles. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, for example, gives a performance so compelling and layered that it becomes the very soul of the movie. The same can be said for Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, whose transformation from an innocent bystander in the family business to a calculating and ruthless leader is one of the most powerful character arcs in film history.

The soundtrack also plays a significant role in shaping the atmosphere of the movie. Nino Rota's score is timeless, evoking the grandiosity and melancholic weight of the Corleone family's legacy. From the very first notes, the music immerses the audience into the world of crime, power, and betrayal, making the story feel even more monumental. It's hard to think of a film where the soundtrack so perfectly complements the emotions and tensions playing out on screen.

One of the central figures in the film is Michael Corleone, whose character arc serves as the backbone of the story. Michael's transition from an innocent, war-hero son who is initially detached from the family's criminal activities to the cold, methodical Don is brilliantly portrayed. His calm and calculated demeanor, even in moments of high tension, signals that he always had the qualities to lead the family, even if he resisted it at first. His decisions, especially the lie he tells at the end, highlight a central theme in the movie: that objectivity and strategic thinking often outweigh moral considerations. It's a chilling reflection of how power operates in the shadows, with Michael's final decisions drawing a line between personal ethics and the brutal efficiency required to run an empire.

The film is undeniably dense, filled with many characters and intricate subplots. For someone who struggles to keep track of names and faces, this can feel overwhelming. It's a complex narrative that requires close attention, with new characters constantly emerging, each playing a pivotal role in the grand scheme. This complexity, while sometimes confusing, also mirrors the chaotic and interconnected nature of mafia life, where loyalty, betrayal, and shifting alliances are part of the daily routine. The fact that even minor characters end up having a significant impact later in the story shows how intricately woven the screenplay is.

Dialogues are undoubtedly the heart of The Godfather. The film is filled with memorable exchanges that capture the themes of power, family, and corruption. Scenes like Michael's conversation with Kay where he insists she is being naive, or the moment when a character mentions how he would steal a purse if it were another wedding-only to later betray the family-demonstrate how every line is charged with meaning. These dialogues don't just drive the plot forward, they build the world of the Corleones, exposing how deeply corruption is embedded in the institutions that are supposed to uphold justice, like the police. The line between morality and immorality becomes increasingly blurred as we witness how personal and political conflicts are resolved through ruthless actions, and words that carry heavy consequences.

In terms of pacing and direction, there are moments where the film feels somewhat disjointed. The transitions between certain scenes occasionally feel abrupt, as though some sequences weren't given the full time to play out. This isn't to say that the direction is bad-far from it. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully builds tension, especially in scenes like the famous revolver scene, where the stakes feel incredibly high and every second drips with suspense. However, at times, the pacing slows, creating atmospheres that might feel drawn out or unnecessarily tense. While this deliberate pace works to establish the weight of certain decisions or events, it occasionally hinders the overall flow of the narrative.

Even with these minor issues, The Godfather remains a film driven by powerful performances and sharp dialogue. Its exploration of power, loyalty, and the darker aspects of human nature is timeless, and while the film may not be perfect in terms of pacing or complexity, its ability to create such a vivid world of moral ambiguity and raw emotion is what cements its place as a masterpiece. It's clear why no remake could ever do justice to the original-it's a unique blend of impeccable casting, memorable writing, and thematic depth that would be nearly impossible to replicate.

While the film's complexity might feel overwhelming at times, especially with the large ensemble cast, its strengths far outweigh these issues. It's not just a movie about the mafia; it's about family, sacrifice, and the human condition. The fact that it continues to spark conversation and interpretation speaks volumes about its impact. Despite the occasional pacing issues and the challenge of keeping track of all the characters, The Godfather excels in creating an immersive, emotionally charged experience that is still unrivaled in its genre."
9,The Best,"This one is absolutely amazing. This movie is rated diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting , enticing and thought provoking. It established new benchmarks for American cinema."
8,Best Movie,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is an enduring masterpiece that transcends the crime genre, offering a profound exploration of power, family, and morality. Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling novel, the film's intricate narrative and impeccable craftsmanship have solidified its status as one of the greatest films in cinematic history.

Et in the 1940s, ""The Godfather"" chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The story unfolds with the juxtaposition of familial loyalty and the brutal world of organized crime. As Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), Vito's youngest son, evolves from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless mafia boss, the film delves into themes of power, corruption, and the American Dream.

The narrative is meticulously structured, balancing intimate character development with broader socio-political commentary. Coppola's direction ensures that each scene contributes to the overarching themes, making the film's substantial runtime feel purposeful and engaging.

10,excellent,"I never thought it was going to be that good, Al Pacino was just perfect, the way Coppola captures the italian family essence was just amazing, the music made me get into the movie, and although it was so long I did not feel it...one of the best movies I'd ever see"
10,THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"This is the best movie of all time. It has everything a good movie should have. Nobody can not enjoy this movie if they are decently intelligent. It is THE BEST DRAMA/CRIME MOVIE of all time, for sure, and it is my favorite movie of all time. It is Marlon Brando at his best. When people think of Brando, they usually first think of the Godfather. If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT!! You are missing out on an excellent piece of film history. There will never be a drama film more powerful than the Godfather."
10,Awesome movie,"Likely among the greatest mafia movie ever. Nothing less. That is by far the greatest film ever to give organized crime to a portrait, this film shows all of it inside out and goes deep in.With brilliant playing by specially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this film reveals how one among the mind mafia families in Ny works, it gives a comprehensive image of how their company runs and what sort an opportunities they got to take on their company, for instance their abnegation in step inside the narcotic company brings on a lot of problems, but additionally it reveals what sorta sacrifices they make, each day might be their last day.

6,Good story bad phasing,The Godfather is regarded as a masterpiece and classic and I ain't denying that. The only thing that makes this a 6 for me is the phasing most Scene felt really dragged out. However I liked the movie and think people should see as long as you're not really inpatient. 6.8/10
5,yes,"Yes, this film is most definitely positively something id watch again and again and again."
10,"""I Believe In America.""","""America has made my fortune."" This is the opening quote to The Godfather and in my opinion, the best movie in American history. And what would America be without it's greatest cinema-piece? It would be a nation lost of entertainment, a nation without a character as undeniable as Marlon Brando's Godfather. Without him, there would be a missing link to every actor in the history of cinema minus the few previous such as Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca. The performance of he convinces anyone that Don Vito Corleone is truly alive. Not only alive in the film, but alive as an actual person who speaks to us in volumes, a man who's moral guidelines and love for his family make him a respectable role model, even though he is the head of a mafia family. Don Corleone reaches out to all that see this movie and he is instantly respected as a person of honor, one who we know is of high power, yet is more a democrat rather than a fascist like other corrupt crime lords. Sonny, his son is in fact, fascist in a manner of speech and it shows when he must take over the business. Tragically, Michael the youngest son of the Corleone family is molded into the form of ""zero tolerance"" throughout the picture. The film really isn't about the Mafia; it's about family. The most important thing in The Godfather isn't the rise of power or the loss of it, only how much the other people in your life mean to you.

Many movies inevitably become boring and have scenes that are meant to be remembered but are easily forgettable. The Godfather never becomes boring. It hooks you the minute it begins and keeps you attached. Impressive for nearly a three-hour movie. An undertaker gives a speech to convince Don Corleone to avenge his daughter against the decadent hoods that attempted to rape her. From there on, the movie continues as a sweeping epic. Death strikes many times in this movie; all the moments of this are breathtaking and at many times, heart-wrenching. I sympathize for the many characters in The Godfather that meet with tragedy because they are so lovable. The 1972 classic takes you inside of the crime syndicate; a place I am oddly enough, happy to be. I feel like a member of the Corleone family every time I watch. Prior to viewing, I must admit that this world wasn't my most desired destination. Many parts and lines are memorable in this movie. What's so amazing is that most of them are back to back, which is a trademark of director Francis Ford Coppola. Most of his films achieve continuous scenes, ones that are embedded in our minds forever. For further proof, see Apocalypse Now or The Godfather Part II.

The Godfather is however, better than it's sequel. Even though the second film may have a more powerful and haunting conclusion and may also have more of a meaning, it still doesn't dig as deep into your soul like the original. Why is the first movie better you ask? Because The Godfather is in this one. Not Robert De Niro's version, but Marlon Brando's. To attempt to replace Brando is a ridiculous waste of time. Brando is The Godfather. No one else can compete with that."
10,One of the best movie evere made,"What can I say?

The godfather is a movie taken care of from head to toe. The movie does not miss anything, it's just perfect, the plot, the actors, the well-written scripts, everything is perfect. If someone has not seen it yet, I recommend that you see it."
9,What to say that hasn't been said?,"Great story of a mafia family. Although this story does not reflect real mafia workings (a fairy tale in comparison) it's great entertainment with a lot of class and a lot of style. The sets are spectacular, acting flawless and characters intriguing.

There is a lot of subtle material ocuuring in the continuous power struggle the mafia family is undergoing, especially with Michael. His gradual change, from war hero to Godfather is brought on by the violent events around him. He can't help but be sucked in. His icy cold demeanor is a reflection of the violent world around him and how the human character adapts to it, the transformation from doting husband to ruthless killer. Various events; the assassination attempt on his father, his brother and wife's murder, the betrayal by associates, the beating of his sister, gives him insight into the workings of the human mind. As the cold, clear thinker (as opposed to his animal-like brother, Sonny) he survives and becomes king.

Brando is great as the older Don who is starting to lose his edge with oncoming age and the love of his family. His old school mentality does not adapt to the more businesslike, colder generation of mafia hoods where honor and respect are becoming a thing of the past.

This movie is marvelous character study comparison between father and son in a violent world. Intelligently done and should hold up for generations to come."
10,Incredible in every way,"This film was incredible. Unlike Goodfellas which was a juvenile and silly glorification of mobsters, Godfather was written to perfection and a masterpiece cinematically."
10,Brilliance.,"The greatest American movie of all time, the Godfather marked a new era of film making much closer to the old studio system style. It was also an early example of a new appraoach to film-making ushered in by new wave of directing talent. Known as the Movie Brats, an including The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola and the likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, they were directors emerging through the study of the film medium in the 1960's and here it definitely shows. Coopla brings in a new innovative, stately style and substance to the production.

Coppola takes the classic gangster genre and, complete with an all star cast and a brilliant, perfectly judged and written screenplay, turns the film into an epic work of beauty. Every scene is beautifully and perfectly composed, with the composition owing much to the classic Italian Reniassance era, in particular the of Caravaggio. The dark, warm colours make the film look a painting; a work of art to be more precise. Coppola direction is masterful, evoking classic Hollywood film-making elements, such as the close-up up and shot-reverse-shot, as well as new innovative forms of film-making including tracking shots coupled with the delicate use of sound and precise cross-cutting editing. He is helped by a wonderful script, co-written with Mario Puza, a lush score by Nino Rota and a masterclass in acting from everyone involved, particularly Brando and Pacino. A brilliant, visceral riveting, flawless masterpiece, quite possibly the greatest film ever made.

10/10"
10,100% Story,"This movie comes from the golden age of Hollywood. No CGI, no fancy video editing, no second hand stories. This is what a pure movie story means.

I mean there are other great stories, but this was certainly genuine, unique in its own way. I have seen some gangster/mobster/mafia movies and none of them could offer the profound ambient of this movie. I like the way they capture every detail, and how the plot is twisted in every way.

The costumes are fabulous. Whoever made them, I want him to make one for me. The cars I believe are authentic and derive from that era. Also, the buildings and the scenery... ooh the details.

Oohh Francis Ford Coppola I wish you could make more movies like this, and I don't mean the sequels to this movie"
7,An amazing movie that i couldn't refuse to watch,"Loved the the movie,the direction and the cast where amazing.

""Wow, what a phenomenal cast and an equally outstanding movie! From the moment the opening credits rolled, I was mesmerized by the talent on screen. Each actor brought their A-game, immersing me completely in the characters' world. The chemistry between the cast members was palpable, adding layers of depth to every scene. It's rare to see such seamless collaboration among performers, and it truly elevated the entire viewing experience.""

""Not only was the cast exceptional, but the movie itself was a triumph. The storytelling was compelling, weaving together intricate plotlines with finesse. I found myself emotionally invested from start to finish, laughing, crying, and holding my breath in suspense. The director's vision was executed flawlessly, capturing the essence of the narrative with breathtaking visuals and impeccable pacing. It's a testament to the filmmakers' talent and dedication that they delivered such an unforgettable cinematic journey.""

""In summary, this movie is a tour de force in every aspect. From its powerhouse performances to its gripping storyline, it's a cinematic masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact. I walked out of the theater feeling exhilarated, eager to discuss every twist and turn with fellow moviegoers. It's not often that a film resonates with me on such a profound level, but this one will stay with me for a long time. A must-see for anyone who appreciates the magic of cinema."""
5,it's not historically accurate to the genre or dark and gritty like i expected. slow paced over-hyped family film,"I do not understand the hype, i have tried earlier today on my second attempt to viewing this movie, i made it about 45 minutes until Don Corleone's first assassination attempt until I coulnd't sit through it anymore.

I want to say again I don't understand the hype and high 9.2 IMDb score for this movie. I will try to explain for the following reasons: #1) There is a lot of hype involved because it is considered a true crime epic, well it's not even a true story or based upon one has anyone realized that? Yes , there is some elements which are relative to the crime world at the time, but no this does not do justice to the real crime families. It's not based on a true story in any way other than something like Inglorious Bastards would be, it only uses some real names and real ideas in our history.

#2) The action and build up is very slow paced and makes it difficult to sit through without getting bored. The action crawls at a snails pace, it does not bother to cover the history behind how Brando's character came to be in the position of power he is in. For something with such a slow build up i am surprised they did not incorporate anything about the don and how he came to be. I am disappointed to be unable to connect with the don on any level, it is only assumed that he worked hard and is a respectable individual.

#3) It does not fully capture the real danger and constant rush involved with living a dangerous life every day. It does not feel real. The first shooting scene looked bundled and strange, even unorganized. It did not look professional or scary. And second, they didn't bother to finish him off or plan this effectively it looked like an assassination attempt doomed to fail. Not to mention his bodyguard, might i add this is the DON the GODFATHER his bodyguard looked like a quivering mass of coward. For someone in such an esteemed and established position he should be able to pick more skilled bodyguards. His crony immediately broke down and cried, any true criminal knows that business comes first, avenge your boss, don't sit and cry. If i was his boss and still alive i would get up and shoot my henchmen in the face for being a chicken. Also the scene where Robert Duvall sneaks a horse head into the director's bed? Am i the only that fully can see how ridiculous that is, and the fact that it is also quite impossible? For you that don't know the movie, he gets welcomed into the directors house to discuss business, and like a sneaky petty con artist insults him behind his back and mutilates his prize horse and sticks it on top of his bed while he's sleeping. The reality of that is just crazy. First of all, a person does not become a godfather by employing low integrity sleaze balls into his direct office, that is not how the world works. Criminal organizations have a code of conduct as well, and need skilled and practical criminals to do their work, criminals who often maintain their own standard of rules and principles. If a criminal did that kind of bull he is gonna being embarrassment to his organization.

#4)This film does not appeal to me as dark and epic, but family fun inaccurate to the brutality and hustle real gangsters encounter. It is a strange concept it is too long and way too inaccurate to reality.

In conclusion, I Want to say as a hardcore fan of crime, and someone who has broken a few rules personally in my time I can say this does not accurately portray the genre. It is far too long and slow paced for me to sit through, i cant say that i have ever finished this from start to finish i tried twice now and don't see my self as being able to."
10,An Offer You Can't Refuse: A Perfect American Epic,"A towering achievement that redefined cinema.

Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather isn't just the greatest gangster movie ever made-it's an epic about family, power, and America itself. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is magnetic, blending menace with unexpected tenderness. Al Pacino's transformation from reluctant son to ruthless boss is one of the greatest character arcs in film history. Gordon Willis's dusky cinematography bathes the film in a haunting, amber-toned shadow that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

Every scene feels monumental. Every performance feels alive. Every line of dialogue feels legendary. The Godfather is Shakespearean in its tragedy, timeless in its themes, and utterly masterful in its execution.

Essential cinema."
10,A masterpiece of cinema,"The film boasts an excellent script, superb direction, stunning cinematography, and a brilliant cast of actors who deliver unforgettable performances. The film explores the themes of loyalty, family, power, and morality in a realistic and nuanced way, showing the complex and often tragic consequences of the choices made by the characters. The film also features some of the most iconic scenes and dialogue in film history, such as the opening scene with Don Vito Corleone, the horse head in the bed, the restaurant assassination, and the final montage. The film is a must-watch for any film lover and a timeless classic that will never lose its appeal."
10,Amazing movie and amazing performances!!!!,"No matter how many years go by, no matter how many times I see this film.

I will always watch it as a first time full of suspense and passionate appetite until the end!!!

Well done to all those involved in the film, with my favourite Francis Ford Coppola as the pioneer!!!

The images and the shooting moments, you feel like you are living through the magic lens or through the eye contact in the film!!!!

The music permeates your acoustic sense with appetite, you feel that you shudder at times at certain points and in general all your senses and imagination are constantly overwhelmed!!!!

Kudos to all the actors, but especially my favorites: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan D,iane Keaton, Morgana King, Richard Conte, in amazing performances and moments of living what they play!!!!"
10,This movie has aged remarkably well,"10/10 just to explain why. Maybe like yourself I was not totally sweeped in by just the high review and I always had a feeling it might just be dissappointing. Like I never got into some other mega hyped movies.

BUT this movie is genuinely a gem. Everything is done so exceptionally well.

Literally just finished watching it and it much better then de Goodfellas which is already a good movie.

Going to stop writing this review so I can starting watching PT2."
10,great movie,"I love this movie. One of my fav movies to watch I this at least once a month. Maybe 4 times a month lol. They all did a great job. How did they get so many legends in one movie that is crazy, this go down in history as one of the greatest gangster movies of all time."
8,good,"I like this movie for me is a Good film, all look prety fine"
7,Book might be better,"It feels that the movie skipped and adapted so much stuff, which makes it even harder to understand. Might want to read the book."
9,Great Movie,"This Movie was amazing. I saw this movie many times.

This movie makes me cry. I fall in love with this movie."
9,Amazing,"Very good movie, watched it about 3 times now. Love the characters and the plot, the cast did an amazing job with portraying the characters."
10,Masterpiece!,"It's masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola.

Every characters is best and every actors done best actings. Direction of movies is fantastic.

A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Go watch this movie and also the second and third part."
9,Awesome,Super cinema movie this movie show you the life meaning and family and also crimes life.
10,The Godfather,This is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie is golden. Highly recommend.
10,Great movie,"In 1972, one based on a bestselling film written by Mario Puzo emerged. The saga of the Corleone family is like a tragic opera, soaked in blood and deafened by the noise of the guns. The shooting marked by disagreements between the director and producers. A film that addresses violence, mafia, family and love. Yes, the love a father has for his family. Cynical characters under a humanized view maintains the essence of the work, no one is who is by chance, are the circumstances that define their choices, all for a greater good: the good of the family. A metaphor for America in the history of The Godfather is clear from the first moment, Francis Ford Coppola holds a dramatic power of passages of the book by Mario Puzo turning a great book into a powerful film, both in its aesthetics and in its essence. The Godfather is my favorite movie, and undoubtedly one of the most important films in history. The most talked about, imitated and revered film."
10,The Best Movie so far in its Class .....,"The character played by Marlon Brando (Don) is incomparable with any other actor in this movie. Also the outline of the movie is fantastic. The story keeps on going and you never feel bored or non interesting scenes. The dialogues are very powerful. ""I'ill make him an offer he can't refuse"". The roles of Tom Hagen, Sonny and of course Michael (Al Pachino) are epic and very heart touching. The sound & music gives us a feel like Italian environment in USA. At the start you may feel a slow moving film, but as the time elapses the best of the acting, directing and dialogues comes on the surface. At the last its a must watch movie at least twice in your lifetime."
5,"Not actually that bad, I just hadn't seen real crap.","I still hate this movie, but I have increased its score and given it some slack.

I have to say there is an absolute ton of crap far worse than this.

Original Title: Unwatchable

I spent twenty some years of life before I watched this movie.

I was always told that it is the greatest movie ever. I sat down one day and got around to watching it. It is really long. It isn't really interesting, and I could not finish it.

This reminds me of Citizen Kane, another movie that gets a lot of praise.

I am not sure why this is a 'timeless classic', but it is a fifty year old movie and it doesn't seem timeless to me. If you must watch it, be prepared to watch a lot of stuff that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the story.

The problem with anything really revolutionary is that it only looks that way once. Once they change how movies are made, other people follow suit. Then it is no longer revolutionary for those that grew up after the change.

I also hold that anything that deviates from a 1.5 hour length is not usually improved upon, and I would happily take a pair of editing shears to this movie."
10,The Saga of a Powerful Family,"Godfather, the saga of a family, who preferred to kill to prove power and occupy territories from powerless people.

When I was watching The Godfather, I was very young. I couldn't believe, how innocent people were killed because of the Mafia (in general). I was nailed in front of the TV together with my father, brother, and mother, watching each scene with curiosity what happens next.

I had a great time viewing these movies, and I wish I had seen them sooner. It's remarkable to see how Part III was created 18 years after Part I, yet everything appears to be continuous when you watch them together.

Director, actors, and the whole production crew worked very hard to make this saga to a memorable film for the audience.

Hollywood could bring more such stories on the big screen."
8,Le Godfather,"The Godfather is definitely an impactful film that helped shape the gangster genre. I feel like it does a lot for Italian American and Mafia culture as its length. For me, I feel l went and did some other stuff while watching due to its length. I still find it is an impactful film regardless. It helped shape the gangster genre. It has two sequels (currently no remakes). It is often used as a blueprint for film making. I feel like it is good that it doesn't lighten up content to get a lighter rating in order to open it up to more audiences (I feel like that is a complaint of some stuff today in my opinion, I feel like the Venom movies should have been rated R). It does have a bit that takes place during Christmastime, so it is technically a Christmas movie, so that is the reason why I watched it and reviewing it today."
10,One of the Greatest Movies of all Time,"The Godfather is a film that is critically acclaimed to the point of reverence, and rightfully so. The writing of the movie is absolutely brilliant, it takes its time setting things up and developing its characters so that events that occur later on have an amplified impact. The outstanding score by Nino Rota is incredible, it is no surprise how popular the soundtrack of this movie is. Marlon Brando gives one of the most impressive performances I have ever seen. His portrayal of Don Vito Corleone was genuinely awe-inspiring. This is thanks in no small part to the dialogue of the movie which is simply stellar. The movie is absolutely brimming with nuanced and poignant lines.

The cinematography and camera-work is excellent too, each scene feels intricately filmed with characters and extras being placed in the perfect orientation.

This movie undoubtedly deserves its showers of praise and will forever be paraded as one of the greatest movies of all time. 10/10."
10,One of the Greatest Films I've ever watched,This movie was fantastic. I see why people call GodFather one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of those movies that just feel so real. I see a lot of other mafia films trying to use this kinda of style but GodFather is on another level. I applaud👋👋
10,The best movie ever,"The best movie ever, i liked so much, i recomend watch this movie, once a year."
7,AWESOME,I think this title is awesome cast and magistral directing. Amaizing production and wonderfull drama.
1,Just an Overrated Movie.,This movie don't deserve to be watched . The movie is very slow.
9,An amazing movie with a confusing plot,"Some people say this movie is way to heavy handed, especially compared to today's movies and movies Gen Z people like.

As a Gen Z, I disagree. This was amazing and deep, I loved it. This movie definitely deserved the love it got."
10,The Greatest Movies,As for what I consider to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen
10,The best movie in the history,This is the best movie I watched in my life. It has no mistakes
9,The Godfather (1972),"The Godfather is a great movie that innovated the crime genre. It has a great story which (for a nearly 3 hour movie) moves quickly. We are brought close to the professional and personal lives of these mafia men, and when we see some of them gunned down, it's relatively hard-hitting. This was an innovation at the time: for a mafia film to bring us emotionally close to the characters. Perhaps the most shocking scene in the film (not to spoil anything) ends with a car riddled in machine gun bullets. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone can be seen as one of the most iconic performances/roles in film history: it is Brando transformed, and he's fun to quote back to. Like any movie that is labeled with such a ""legendary"" status, The Godfather is a tad overrated; but still very good nonetheless thanks to it's great story, performances, and iconic scenes."
10,The perfect opening made a legendary movie.,"I heard about ""The Godfather"" a long time ago. But the reason I watched it for the first time is because of my English conversation class. My teacher is crazy about it. He asked us to write a movie thesis. The story itself is very exciting. But as a movie, to turn this story into a legend, you need a team of extraordinary play. Marlon Brando, as a veteran actor, blended the two roles of father and godfather very well, and very natural. His first appearance in the movie has completely conquered the audience. He is a unique godfather. Director: Francis Ford Coppola also arranged the story very well. Although this is a very long movie, I have no fatigue at all. The climax and calm of the story have very good rhythm and regularity. Music is also iconic. You may forget it briefly, but when you hear it again, you will immediately know it is ""The Godfather""."
9,Masterpiece,Masterpiece Brilliant acting Great storytelling Inspiration to all generations
7,The Godfather,"When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious ""Corleone"" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times."
1,It was... OK,"look i understand how many people love this film; good acting, pretty solid storyline, etc... but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward. i am a teenager, and while i do love guns, killing, and all that good ""teenage stuff"" that is in this movie, many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers. i feel that they are a thing of the past, and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest, and basically, don't love it as much as many people seem to. Having said this, i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather, not because of the mafia ties, but the struggles that the man character underwent; struggles that i can identify with. this was something ""The Godfather"" lacked.

again, its not bad... its just... OK"
10,A Legend,It's the Mona Lisa of the films and cult film that never will be old. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino adopt their role and they've contributed to the art to the that cinema era.
10,The greatest movie of all Time,"The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre and over the years I've watched over 500 movie of many different genres and so many different countries, culture... and still believe that The Godfather movie is the best film I've ever watched ! If u ask me what's so appealing about it i don't really know how to answer is it the music ? Is it Marlon Brando acting ? Is it Al Pacino performance ? I can't really say it's just a masterpiece ... i wish if i could give it 1000 star not just 10."
10,The best movie of all time,"Master pace, it's best movie you can see, the directing by coppola was pefectttttt Literally, I did not feel the duration of the film and the acting was in the greatest aspect and the writing is the least that is said about it is great and I do not need to talk about the dialogues because it is the essence of this film and I can make my statement that it is the greatest series of films that you can watch"
10,No Words To Describe,"THE GODFATHER ****

Here we have such a masterpiece of a film, that it has become a big part of the American Culture. Marlon Brando's speech is imitated, the horse head scene has been poked to death, and the musical score is used in spoofs. Yes, here we have the quissential mafia film. One of the first, and still the best.

It started off as a novel written by Mario Puzo, until Francis Ford Coppola came in and expressed his interests of turning it into a film. He took it to Paramount Pictures, and they originally slated it to be a modernized version. They figured it would be much cheaper to make it in the present day (1971) and would hit audiences harder. However, Coppola, along with Puzo, fought them day on end for the rights to leave it as it was. Eventually, they gave in, but gave Coppola even more troubles when they disagreed on practically half of Coppola's cast. Paramount eventually gave into Coppola again, and let him make the film.

This film is magnificent in so many ways. Performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, James Caan, and Marlon Brando make the film shine, and also make it some of the best acting ever caught on film. Most people will tell you that The Godfather is every guy's favorite film. I guess you could say that's true for the most part, although I know many women who love this film as well. It speaks a universal language to film buffs and non- film buffs alike.

The film is a wonderful example of perfection. A true American masterpiece."
10,This might be insane but.......,"I think this movie is better than every other movie put together. Absolutely perfect. I won't go on why because I see everyone else already stated why this movie is amazing. Easily the best movie ever. If you don't like this movie you don't like movies, period. The music, acting, directing, dialog are all fantastic. The only other movie that can match this is PART II. With is the second best movie ever. This movie will live forever in the minds and hearts of every movie lover around the world. I can;t see how anyone can call this moving boring, actually this first time I watched it I thought it was just okay, but by the third time I was blown away. If you haven't seen this film go NOW and watch it, and then watch it again and again. It will the best movie experience of you life, I promise you that."
10,Incredible,Totally blown away. Absolute masterpiece one of the best films ever made!!!!
3,More action please.,"I watched this film last night because I heard Kanye West once said that it was an all time classic. Now I do respect the rapper and producer's opinion but I beg to differ.

Firstly I found it quite boring, it just doesn't have the action packed pace of some of my personal favourite movies such as Weekend at Bernie's 2, Teen Wolf, or Kickboxer 3 : The Art of War.

The acting wasn't great either. I know Pacino and Brando are decent actors but compared to performances such as Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club or Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack, it's seriously under par. It's easy to play a moody gangster but could you imagine Al Pacino playing Ross Geller in Friends? Me neither. The guy has no versatility.

One more thing is the music wasn't too hot either. Just classical nonsense all the way through. By my calculations, The Godfather would be 37% better if there was a tad more Genesis, maybe ""Invisible Touch"" playing over the restaurant shooting scene.

3/10.

Cheers."
9,This is THE GANGSTER FILM.,"An amazing piece of work. The first time I saw the movie I couldn't but realize how the character was studied. This should be a subject of great interest to the filmmakers today because you don't get to see this kind of work.

Great movie. Great cast. And an overall great experience."
10,👍🏻,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
10,Best film in all times!,"I saw today again and again and again idk how many time i watched and every time i learn something, this is best movie of all times!!!!!!!!"
10,Excellent...!!!!,"This is the one. The movie that sums perfection in 175 minutes. Just gets better every time I see it. Every bit of the film is precious and the movie's soundtrack is a classic. Just to hear the initial notes sends shivers down your spine. The conjunction of all this stars in one movies and the great performance given by each one of the actors is amazing. I love Brando's performance, and the way that Micheal Corleone's character is developing thru the film, Robert Duvall is great as Tom Hagen and James Caan as the hot-headed Santino opposite to everything that is Michael Corleone. All wrapped in a fine script written by Puzo which is really flawless. This is why I love movies."
10,a real film,It shows what cinema art is and what cinema is not. The Godfather helps me to understand art better and i think it does its duty as good as possible. and i should say that this film shows golden ages of cinema too.
3,"Too long,good acting","The movie is too long and almost put me asleep. Even though,great acting by Al. The story is not unique and not interesting. I know it's popular to love the movie as a classic piece, but i didn't like it so much."
10,Timeless cinematic excellence,"As long as movies exist, The Godfather will always be relevant and stand out as one of the all time best. When most people think of a perfect movie, this one comes to mind, and for good reason. Every single aspect of filmmaking is executed down to the finest detail with flawless results, most notably the violence, which is graphic but never gratuitous. The ensemble acting is arguably the best ever, with every performance being beliveable and memorable. The story of a mafia family trying to survive amidst a crumbling empire is very compelling, but it's much more than a mafia movie. It's a story about family and the importance of staying together.

Over the years, The Godfather has become nothing less than an American institution, inspiring several imitations as well as parodies and creating many phrases and expressions that have made their way into pop culture. There is something in The Godfather that appeals to everyone and every generation. For this, it will always find favor with the masses and truly remain a timeless classic of cinema."
10,What do you really want to watch ?,well... what do you really want a movie to be? did you ever ask yourself that? If somebody gave you all the power to produce a movie... what would you do? a movie ... of course... but this is NOT a movie. reality is not something that you can create at your free will. the hardest part in art is to (at least) try to express reality. But you will only express it as YOU see it... I think this is one of those artistic accomplishments that came very very close to what everybody sees. that's art. And thanks to Al Pacino & Marlon Brando ! anybody who even questions these actors... should think twice before. I'm proud to be a contemporary with Al Pacino ! thank you
10,This film it's the very best of picture of New Hollywood,"This is a film that contains almost all of the factors that a perfect film should have. Great themes, plot that hooks you from the beginning, little twist and details that make you love the film, fantastic cinematography and designing, good costumes, amazing character development, and of course the greatest cast any film has seen (Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...)"
10,"Leave The Weapon, Get The Cannoli","It is certainly one of the best films ever made in the movies, it really is a shame that it is difficult to produce movies these days. with such an engaging story. I miss the Mafia-themed movies nowadays, it would be nice to write about how the Mafia acts today in the world because it is a little explored theme nowadays."
8,Masterpiece,This movie is amazing. I can not believe this. this movie is absoultirly awesome.
10,An Amazing Film,"The Godfather is probably the most well crafted film ever made. No true fan of film will deny this piece of art. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino turn in amazing performances. James Caan and Robert Duvall are equally brilliant. The cinematography is among the best I've seen and the lighting is nearly perfect.

Watch this movie. Then watch it again."
7,"I thought it was going to more ""special""","This movie was amazing, I'm not gonna lie. I really liked the characters. I loved the story and the message it was giving. The cast is full of very talented people who did their job amazingly and the sountracks just makes me relax but it felt a little boring at some parts for me.

I think this is releated more to my personal taste because all of my friends adore this movie but I thought that it was going to be way bigger and more special. Like because of how popular this movie is I thought I'm going to see something big or revolutionary. The movie just felt too long and I couldn't wait for it to be finished.

I think it is good to be watched one time so you can walked around and say that you have watched the Godfather but for me, The movie was a little off and personally I would have enjoyed it more if i was reading it as its book or playing it as a video game because as I said earlier the story is very nice."
1,Extremely overrated,"An overlong and slow film that may have seemed better 50 years ago, but is now boring and very dated. Marlon Brando's make up looks so fake and the obviously Jewish James Caan is badly miscast as an Italian-American. The restaurant meeting would never have happened in reality - Sollozzo tries to kill Vito, and then just a few days later Michael is just going to sit down and have dinner with him? Lol. In any case Sollozzo would have known the police captain had to remain on call 24 hours a day. McClusky would have given a false location, rather than the restaurant, to the police."
9,Classic,The movie everyone has to say they liked (don't dare to say you never watched it) if they don't to go in a fight with a stranger.
10,the god father,Is the greatest of all time .....cant get bored of watching the triology
10,BEX,"It can be boldly said that this film is one of the eternal masterpieces of world cinema. A wonderful acting team with a great director, writer and cinematographer who forces us to see this film to the end. This atmosphere is very special and wonderful and it gives us a mafia feeling."
10,is the definitive 10 stars out of 10.,"Love this crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."
10,What happens if you step into Chaos?,"When you finally decide to watch this movie, since it came out in the 70s, and you were born about twenty years later, you sit down in front of your TV with some degree of expectation. Expectation the movie sees in your eyes, then laughs at you for some minutes. And then a man wakes up with blood all over his pajamas and a horse head in his bed. So you realise that something you were simply fearing is actually true. That is the complex life of the Corleone family.

But please, try ignoring your expectations. Forget about the hype, as many describe this as one of the ""greatest movies of all time"", if not THE one. You won't be disappointed, that is, but there is nothing like a ""greatest"" movie. This is ""only"" a masterpiece in cinematographic production, acting, writing and score, much akin to an opera piece.

""The Godfather"" does not care about classical Aristotelian unity, and it can do that thanks to an incredibly coherent screenplay thanks to the combined effort of writer Mario Puzo and director F.F. Coppola. Years pass by, oceans are crossed and decisions are taken without the viewers noticing, as they can't ignore every character's intriguing motivations and cold-hearted yet realistic resolution. This is one of the greatest strenghts of the movie, as its surrealisticly realistic tone constantly entangles your brain in its world: you always know that all you are watching is just fiction, only a story, yet it impossible for the viewer to unsee the cruel nature of a world that did exist. Its a ""historical character saga"" about nonexistent characers.

Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's performances have no particular traints of features. Because they are flawless. The supporting cast did a great job too, so good in fact that most of the time you can't tell who is the supporting and who's the main cast.

Gordon Willis' fotography is gorgeous from the first moments of the movie. Slowly moving scenes, beautifully lit like Caravaggio's portraits, bring a whole new life to the words ""noir"" and ""chiaroscuro"". We are talking about Italians, after all, and making Marlon Brando mumble some ""italian"" words sure does not mean a lot. Still, it was nice to hear Italian words pronounced correctly almost all the time.

Nino Rota did not write music. The sophisticated sounds you hear while your eyes are accompanied by the splendidly crafted frames are powerful overflows of emotions. Nino Rota was truly a prodigy and a master of his art.

But how are all these different features kept toghether in this masterpiece of a movie? It's a slow and steady descent into darkness, just look at Al Pacino's character, Michele Corleone. So, what happens if you finally step into chaos? Well, you won't like it. Your life won't like it. Your loved ones won't like it. But you won't even notice."
7,Loved this movie,Its just nice watch it you wont regret it. Loved every part of this movie
1,THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!,"I hope they remake this movie maybe then that nonsense will stop, but then again once is enough. I swear people just claim it to be the greatest of all time because it's the COOL thing to do, most of them probably haven't even seen it. It's long (really, really long), boring and pointless. Marlo Brandon (Archie Bunker called him that) was a terrible actor."
9,Every aspect of the film was on point,"This movie was really good but the only problem i have is that it lasts too long in my opinion. With that aside, Coppola changed everything we know in film creating this masterpiece. Stratnig from the plot and the sound, incredible editing, lighting thought out well. Also ,the complete change of Michael's character because of the family which we see is the main priority in most of the gangster movies was outstanding . Marlon Brando who stayed so in character, and the lightning always above his head which shows no emption in his eyes, where he had to show it with his voice did a marvelous job. And Nino Rota who made music for Don Korleone as a light motive and all the other compositions made this movie 10x better. The editing ,with picture and sound, especially in baptism scene, was so incredilbe that it makes it one of the best moments of film history in my opinion. The ending also has a really powerfull message. There will never be movies like this again simoy because we entered the animated era with VFX being the best part of the film. It is no mistake to say Coppola did marvelous job with this movie and gained the respect all over the world. Genious."
10,10/10,"10/10 loooooooooooooooooooooove it.

Simply Brilliant."
10,The originator of gangster movies,"Representatives of Italian churches and triads 'successful people in the capitalist countries such as the United States have escaped, stolen, established, avenged, whitewashed growth history, and mixed the generation and destruction of family, love, and friendship in different situations. . Family interests are above everything else, and everything that is not conducive to the growth and development of the family must be eliminated. The coexistence of interests is the foundation of harmony, and the divergence of interests is the beginning of hostility. The death of the old godfather, the birth of the new godfather. Is the beginning of an unstoppable ending."
9,leading gangster movie,"i saw more gangster movie but all are based on this movie. himself is not even the central character in the drama. he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II"
10,I think it's very beautiful and intriguing,"This is the most interesting film I have seen so far. It contains a lot of life principles. I like it very much. Every month I will look at it again. Each time it can bring me a different experience. I really won't get tired of it at all. Too many details and scenes are handled very well, which makes people can't help praising,"
10,One of the best films I've ever watched,"One of the best films I've ever watched. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, it is also liked by many moviegoers.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox.

Do not miss this film!"
6,Classic!!!,This movie is a classic. It introduced a lot of up and coming stars. Definitely a movie that needs to be added to your catalog. The horse head in the bead is iconic
1,HIGHLY OVERRATED,Worst film I don't know why the hell this movie got Oscar
9,One scene of this movie and I have to see it all over again!,"This movies keeps surprising me. I have never seen Al Pacino in a better part. Marlon Brando was a legend then already, but only became one for me after this movie. The mix of family-honour, realistic action/ murders and the incredible cast makes this film one of my all-time favorites!"
10,The Greatest. Truly.,"Now, let's take a look at what anyone who is serious about film says is the greatest of all time. They're right. Both Godfathers stand alone as the two of the best scripted, acted, and directed films of all time. In all, they come out to the two best films. If you read some of my other reviews, you'll find that I consider a saga one film. A saga is best watched simultaneously. The Godfathers are a perfect example of how a series can get it right. Except the third. The third was just plain bad. Did Coppola really need to do this? Throw in another addition to the greatest saga in history? Sure, Andy Garcia was pretty spot-on as Sonny's illegitimate child. But they might as well have had someone like Dustin Hoffman play Michael, because he would've looked and sounded more like him than Pacino did at the time. And Sofia sucked. Good director, bad actress. It was not needed, because the first two were flawless. The ways of how this crime family rose, fell, rose, fell, etc., was perfect. I distinctly remember saying in one of my film classes (in front of a bunch of total film snobs) that Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The other students stared at me with blank looks on their faces, as if I had told some horribly offensive jokes. Screw them. Why shouldn't he be considered? He deserves it, with The Godfather, Part II, Apocalypse Now, and The Conversation. Four classics. Did the other students not like it because he made a couple of flops (Jack, The Rainmaker)? All the best did (Kubrick-Eyes Wide Shut, Nolan-Insomnia), and they continue to be praised. I did enjoy The Outsiders, even if it doesn't come close to touching The Godfathers. Apart, they are masterpieces. Together, they are the definition of flawless filmmaking.

The genius behind the storyline is that we never see the Don at his peak. We see him just before his peak, and just after as well. Everything, from the script to the directing, makes this storyline perfect. But it is the acting that has the biggest aspect on the story. Two actors (De Niro and Branda, both two-time winners) won for the role of Don Vito. Also, the surrounding cast of Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Keaton, make the film what it is, attached to a pitch-perfect script by Mario Puzo and Coppola. to quote Richard Roeper, saying you like film but have never seen The Godfather is like ""saying you love to drink but you've never had water."" Too true."
10,The best movie ever,"I see this movie at least 1 per month, and i love everything about it. The actors could not be chosen better, Marlon Brando made his best presentation. The Godfather raise Al Pacino and Robert Duvall to glory. It is the cinema masterpiece."
9,All-time Great,It really is one of the all time great films for numerous reasons. But what really stood out to me was Al Pacino's performance. He's so good and brings out so much dynamic to Michael's character.
10,Epic,"One of the best movies of all times. Good plot, wonderful cast. In my opinion a piece of art."
10,No summary needed....,".....for true cinema fans. I feel more like I'm just casting my vote to help keep this from being caught by ""Shawshank Redemtion"", which not only isn't even close to being the 2nd best film of all time (I was thinking more like ""Casablanca, ""Sunset Blvd."", ""Gone With the Wind"", etc...), but isn't close to being the best film of the 90's (Pulp Fiction, Schindler List)). the Godfather is the best film of the 1970's, which was itself a peak time for film creativity. the performances here are truly a shining example of the best in naturalistic acting. the cinematography is unsurpassed, with the dark lighting playing a key role. a lot of women mistake this for a ""guy movie"" or ""male fantasy"". maybe it is, but it isn't ONLY that. the choice we all face between our dual nature is fascinating and compelling."
6,Nice Movie i like And watch,I like this and watch many time.Beautiful crafted in this movie
5,slow to start,My husband loves this movie so I tried watching it. Really don't know why it is so highly rated. Hard to get into it. Very slow start.
9,The Godfather,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.

Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.

Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.

Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.

Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).

It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance."
9,A classic cult film,"I had watched this film for the first time in 2014 and since then I always revisit it for its performances, direction and also the principals which it reflects upon in life. Its more than just a crime drama, in fact according to me its an entire world which the film takes its viewers into. Its a must watch if you are a movie buff or even if you are into dramas as this movie will live for ever in the world of cinema due to its outstanding storytelling, layering, characterizations and performances. The best part is that it also reflects upon the grayish shade of each character and that shows the depth the film has and its not just any shallow story or film."
8,Great!,Great. I like this movie. I have watched this movie over and over again and still don't get bored watching it. The plot of the movie is very engaging. There are many unexpected and touching details.
10,film,"Best noir drama, cinematography is like painting best exile to study lighting and colour palate should really study and enjoy this film"
10,You will fall in love with the Corleone's,"This is an amazing movie. I would recommend it to anyone. It makes you feel like a part of the ""family"". After watching the movie, you feel like these are real people, no actors. It's hard to believe that Puzo invented these characters."
10,A Masterpiece,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate."
10,the best movie in the world,"It is the best movie that can exist on the face of the earth, on the day that another one is made as I hope to be alive even, but until now there is no one who wins"
7,A Flower of Sin,"As someone who didn't see this film until today, I hesitated for a long time before deciding to write this review. In fact, I've heard about The Godfather for a long time, it's said to be a film that 'a man must see once in his life', and people around me have mentioned it to me in one way or another. There are two reasons why I haven't watched it. The first is that the film was shot too long ago, and I felt that some of the ideas and filming techniques didn't resonate with me. The second reason is that it is a 3-hour drama that I don't have the courage to sit in front of my computer screen and finish it in one sitting. But today I did, haha. In fact, to be honest, maybe my expectations were too high, after seeing the shock to me is not so big, maybe this is a film that needs to be repeated to savour it. So today I'm going to talk to you about some of the little details of the film that I like.

The first scene in the film is so poignant that the lines between the funeral parlour owner and the godfather let the audience know that this is a gangster-themed film. The Godfather is also portrayed very impressively in this scene, most notably in the way he speaks, with his raspy voice and bulging cheeks, which the actor is said to have actually stuffed in his mouth at the time. In the dialogue between the two men, we learn that the funeral parlour boss didn't get what he called justice, so he came to the Godfather for help. His anxiety can be representative of the anxiety of the general public, especially the lower and middle social constituent groups. They want fair, direct, and effective punishment, so they turn to social groups with a gangster twist, which is often more effective in particular times. The Godfather agrees to help him with his problem, and the boss kisses the back of the Godfather's hand, a classic gesture that echoes the end of the film. I must mention the cat in the Godfather's hand, which perfectly portrays the Godfather's gentle and kind image. The second scene of the film comes to the wedding, and the cheerful and crowded scene is a strong contrast to the first scene. The characters of the film also appear one by one, and the film is officially opened.

In the wedding sequence, there are three dramatic events that the Godfather has to deal with: dealing with the unfair treatment of the undertaker, helping the woman to emigrate, and helping a celebrity to get a role in the film. The film shows one of the most difficult things to do - take care of the Hollywood mogul. This segment gives Tom's character a rather colourful logo.

Next comes the reversal of the story, when the Godfather is assassinated, but the situation is not fatal. Mike is calm and collected in the face of danger, while on the contrary, the other two brothers are at a loss for words. Next, Mike protects his father in the hospital again, and it is the rival assassination plan that fails again. This episode once again shows Mike's carefulness, alertness, resourcefulness and daring beyond the ordinary. The next assassination is in an Italian restaurant, a few bullets decided Mike's fate.

Mike returned to the U. S., replacing his father as the new generation of Godfather, the Godfather and Mike in the garden scene is also very exciting. It's not long, but it's very informative, but it actually explains one thing: whoever steps in and arranges a negotiation with the enemy is a traitor. But the scene is very informative: 1. The Godfather's poor state of health, suggesting that he will soon pass away. 2. the final succession of the old and new Godfathers. 3. the old Godfather's deep regret that Mike has taken over the family's business, and he hopes that his son will be the one who will control others, rather than being played by them. 4. the ambiguity for the Godfather's death in the next scene, when he is enjoying the heavenly pleasures of the world with his grandson. 5. how to deal with enemies, and to identify traitors . In fact, this scene is the Godfather's last words. At the end of this scene, which is also the climax of the film, Mike completes the baptism of the Godfather in the religious sense, and also completes the baptism as a mob godfather. And truly becomes a godfather like his father.

The film portrays the deceitfulness, intrigue and sinfulness of the noir characters very well, and at the same time shows the emotions and character of the mission in a delicate and precious way. It combines the beauty and darkness of human nature into one, making the fate of the characters more tragic. The Godfather is a landmark in both content and form, and no movies from that time can compete with it."
2,Did I watch the same movie???,This movie was incredibly boring. It kinda had me in the start but lost me afterwards. I guess it's goos in other aspects of filmmaking but I watch a movie for entertainment.
9,Irreplaceable,"A perfect combination of a traditional Italian familiy mixed with mafian and underground crimes. One of the movies you watch and understand the plot, but conclusions and story are changing days after."
10,"A great ""family"" movie","This movie gives the audience a look at what family really means. ""The Godfather"" has the cast, writing, score, directing, and cinematography that makes great movies. The story of the Corleone family is one that endures. It is less about crime and more about the trials of any normal family. It casts light on the hypocrisy of the establishment through showing society its own dark underbelly. The thought that a mafia don is no different than a Senator or President (Kay and Michael's discussion after Michael returns from Sicily and tells Kay he is running the family business), shows how naive society can be and how quick it is to offer blame on people who believe in something as opposed to nothing. All in all one of the Ten Best movies of all time."
10,COOL,"COOL.

COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL."
10,"Impressive, most impressive...","All of my 21 years of living, I had never had the desire to see The Godfather movies. I didn't care much about the Mafia or anything related to it. Then one day, I was a little bored (I do live in Lubbock ya know) and I started watching this movie. Wow. Great acting, great mood, great everything. This is basically a perfect picture. Francis Ford Coppola brought together everything and made the film very realistic. And let's not forget Al Pacino's stirring performance as Michael Corleone. Great flick. Too bad George Kennedy's not in it."
10,Amazing,"In my opinion one of the best movies ever made, no waste from beginning to end."
7,The son of a Mafia,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed. Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/19122-the-godfather"
4,"Shallow characters, unrelated sketches.","There's no transition between Michael I (american hero, away of family business) and Michael II (Sicilian mobster). The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence."
10,How every movie should be made,"I can't say enough great things about ""The Godfather."" It is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. The plot is gripping, an amazing interpretation of the American Mafia, and the film's acting is superb. The characters make the film seem like we are watching a documentary moreso than a movie. You can see the transformation of Michael from the reluctant son, to the man who inherits an empire. Al Pacino's performance is outstanding. Marlon Brando is such a believable godfather that I think mafiosos throughout history would feel intimidated if they ever had to go to a ""meeting"" with Don Corleone.

James Caan also provides a smashing performance as the hot-headed Sonny. His ferocity and high spirited attitude adds so much to the film. I've always wondered if Robert Duvall's natural speaking voice is that of Tom Hagan or of another one of his characters like the preacher or Gus.

This is one of the few films that I will never, ever grow tired of watching. Dramatically and cinematically speaking, it is one of the few films that I admire and wish that other Hollywood directors and producers would try to emulate as far as style, story development and acting goes, especially in Hollywood's dark time of remakes and lackluster script writing."
9,Mafia King,"Probably the best Mafia ever! So many scenes that depict the life of living with the gangsters. A great cast of family in crime, and the trials of families involved."
8,GOOD,"""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Never let your enemies know what you're thinking."" ""Never hate your enemy. It affects your judgment."" Malone's performance was truly disheartening, the inarticulate godfather, but no one dared ignore his every word. His face was always impassive, but behind it lurked something that could not be ignored -- a kind of elegant rage, calm cruelty!"
10,Great movie,"This film is just mind blowing! I love it! The characters, the music and the story - I had goosebumps all the time. The film is perfect. Its great directing meeting great great artists."
10,how you start whaching movies,"In case you want to start watching movies and you don't know the way to start you should start with this timeless masterpiece this movie is a masterpiece drawn very carefully from actors photography scenario audio, costumes scenes drama violence and emotion The great role of Marlene Brando in this movie makes you attached to this character and the principles that the role reflects You can't really describe this movie in the ways that I watched it Also I can't either, no matter how expressive words and balanced language I used to clarify the movie, I don't know how Francis Ford Coppol was able to turn the scenario of Coppola and Mario Pozo into this beautiful masterpiece."
10,"GREATEST MOVIE, PERIOD....",Best directed and acted movie ever! Too many great things too name about this movie. From the costumes to the music. Everything is superb!!
6,best movie ever,Must see movie of all times love this movie all of the godfathers movies
8,boring but good,"Good movie but it is long , I mean 3 hours it is really a long time , the acting was the best thing and really great , the soundtrack not that good I don't now may be because I don't love classic movies"
9,Great Film,"""The Godfather"" is a classic. The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history.

""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. Must Watch 9/10"
10,About the mafia underworld seen from the eyes of the Corleone Family,"This movie is perfect in every aspect of it, the script is to good, including lines that no script has ever equalled, and is true to real crime in the real world. The directing, producing of this is perfect, some of the best acting ever, the art directing is fantastic, costume designs fantastic, perfect is the word. This film is great to me because nobody had an idea like this one before the film, this film included great drama, not like other crime films which are just there for the explosions, and gun shoots. To me this film has the best ending ever, no ending has ever come near this one, maybe the second one came close, but nothing else. If you haven't seen this movie, and you're a big movie buff, I suggest you see this because this is the movie you can't refuse."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece of Cinema,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a film that has transcended generations and become a landmark in the history of cinema. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the movie presents an epic narrative that immerses viewers in the ruthless and intriguing world of the Italian mafia in mid-20th century America.

His masterful direction creates a dense and immersive atmosphere, conveying both the grandeur and intimacy of the story. Meticulously chosen camera angles and stunning cinematography capture the essence of the characters and the environment they inhabit.

Furthermore, the brilliant ensemble cast contributes to the film's exceptional quality. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the powerful leader of the mafia family. His magnetic presence and distinctive voice bring to life a complex character who has become a cinematic icon.

His transformation throughout the film is fascinating to watch, showcasing Pacino's talent and versatility as an actor.

The story unfolds in a captivating manner, with thrilling twists that keep viewers glued to the screen.

Its perfect combination of masterful direction, incredible performances, intelligent screenplay, and memorable soundtrack makes it an undeniable classic.

In summary, ""The Godfather"" is a film that deserves to be appreciated and celebrated. It is a timeless masterpiece that sets the standard for the mafia film genre and continues to inspire filmmakers and captivate audiences to this day."
9,"It is just an incredible movie then, now, and for eternity.","For a film that is almost 50 years old now, the story is brilliant, the acting, sensational especially from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. I watched this movie for the first time about 2 weeks ago now and wish I had seen it sooner. There are very few films that I would give a 10/10 to but the godfather takes the cake with the cherry on top, for those who like a good story, brilliant acting, a bit of the mafia, guns blazing, this is your cuppa, it certainly is mine. Utterly incredible, now I just need to watch part 2 and 3!"
10,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing.","The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history.

10,Nice this movie,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

10,One of my Top 10 Favorites.,"This movie is one of the most brilliantly crafted piece of film i have ever seen. The story is told so well, so complex, and with so many characters you could get lost but...its so engaging its brilliance. The dirction is in VERY HIGH top notch and so is the acting. The script is great and this is a must see for everyone."
7,Overrated! Vastly inferior to the second film... (Very Minor Spoilers),"The first 20 minutes of this film were slow. But then it took off and the plot got more and more interesting until some stuff happened and the main protagonist had to go to some foreign place. After that, it became a bore-fest filled with long drawn out scenes that added ""little to nothing"" to the plot. Like the guy's foreign wife... What was the Point of That!!? Fortunately, It ended in a pretty bad@$$ and brilliant manner. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie were pretty great. Still, that doesn't excuse the amount of filler and lack of character development for the characters that were actually important in the next film. That includes The protagonist too. (His Character Arc wasn't handled very efficiently. He was a lot better in the second movie.)"
1,Boring,"Despite hearing about what a classic this is I hadn't seen this until now. All I can say is Wow!! I didn't know how lucky I was before to miss this but now it is too late and I will never get those 3 hrs of my life back. The acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow, those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard. I suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012, but at least that had some ridiculous special effects, all this had was some really bad acting. The best parts were a couple of LOL moments during the shooting scenes, otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and I fell asleep at least 5 times."
10,godfather,"A masterpiece, everyone should watch. Al Pacino reinvented himself."
10,this is brilliant and takes its place as one of the best films of all time,"The Godfather is a 1972 American gangster-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay by Puzo, Coppola, and Robert Towne (uncredited).[3] It stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton, and features John Cazale, Talia Shire, Al Martino, and Abe Vigoda. The story spans ten years from 1945 to 1955 and chronicles the fictional Italian American Corleone crime family. Two sequels followed: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990.

The Godfather received Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay, and has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In addition, it is ranked third, behind Citizen Kane, and Casablanca on the AFI's 100 Years100 Movies list by the American Film Institute. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.[4]"
10,An amazing period piece,"An outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers."
10,The best movie ever,If there is one way to run a business its like Don Vito Corleone there is no way to describe the sheer brilliance of this film i will never forget it as long as i live. Although he is no longer alive Marlon Brando is in my book one of the greatest actors. I don't recall blinking once through the whole movie and although the movie is a little cheese in the visual effects it becomes timeless by having such a classic setting like the 1940's new york. Thing i loved best was the characters and how they each changed through out the film although the time span was skewed so as to not be able to tell how much time had gone by the way the characters acted was enough of a clue to show vast amounts of change in time and life. I loved this movie for many reasons but when i grow up i wanna be like Mikey Corleone
9,A classic.,"It's not just the gangsters or the atmosphere...It's the recreation of the time. It's the music. It's the tension.

Sometimes, a film just gets everything right. This is one of those times."
10,The Best Movie,"This is movie is the greatest movie ever made (in my perspective). Has the best actors and also the best story line, who couldn't ask for a better movie.

10,BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"The Godfather is one of the best movies ever. It has an excellent story with an excellent mafia atmosphere, and since I love the mafia theme, I fell in love with this film. It's unbelievable how well the film is made, and it's a 1972 film. The actor Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone, performed a perfect job, and the godfather himself is definitely worth mentioning. Overall, all the actors did an excellent performance here. There are a lot of legendary scenes. The scene in Italy is one of the best and maybe the best scene of all the movies ever. There is also a soundtrack, which is masterful and it is one of the best soundtracks ever. Also maybe the best ever. The Godfather is MASTERPIECE and it's a MUST-SEE movie."
8,unscrupulous killer,"What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word ""cinema"". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes.

Although this film has a three-act structure, all the acts are well packed with content. And so the film is watched in one breath. And most importantly, what message ... Each person has the right to decide for himself what meaning was laid down by the author. For me, the central theme of the story is the theme of the family and its importance. In three hours of screen time, the two protagonists undergo a gigantic evolution, turning into their opposites in interaction with each other. The all-powerful mafia becomes a feeble old man, and an idealistic young man becomes an unscrupulous killer."
10,The Godfather of Mafia Film,"As the name of this masterpiece implies, Godfather is truly the Godfather of Mafia Film. Every cliche and idea that has been introduced into movies and TV shows based around the Mafia have elements that were first introduced in the Godfather and its sequels. And the Godfather's influence does not only lay in English speaking countries. For example, as someone of Turkish descent, I have noticed that many of Turkey's mafia-based TV shows are influenced by this masterpiece."
10,Best movie ever!!,"From the initial scene that represents joy (marriage of Vito's daughter) to Michael's death due to the death of his only daughter (innocent, unrelated to the world of the Mafia), the godfather represents cinema at its maximum splendor, he here my arguments. In this first film a series of events occur that make this film the best in history. At first Coppola chooses his cast perfectly, especially Michel (Al Pacino), a character with little experience and innocence in the world of the Mafia, Sonny, an impulsive man lacking reason, and Tom, a great lawyer and thinker, but always (redundancy ). ) focused on advocacy. This is where Michael stands out, as his cunning focuses on the street, on everyday life, on quickly reading his surroundings and in particular the sign that there is a conspiracy to murder his father, Vito. First talk of the first film, Santino thinks, Vito realizes that his son opened an important door for the enemy (Sollozzo) to take advantage of his weakness or perhaps enthusiasm, trying to overthrow Vito, through the natural and economic seduction of his son . Older, who at the time falters and interprets that he must take the reins. Later, Michael, in a flash of personality, performs one of the best sequences in cinema (spoiler); suggest the death of the police commander and Sollozzo himself. The only son who was never involved with the mafia suggests getting involved, the beginning of the best progress of the character, and likewise of one of the best actors in the history of cinema. With these short scenes that exemplify the magnificence of Godfather 1 (without even representing 30% of the saga), I take the argument as sufficient to explain what, for me, is the best movie and cinema saga that has existed, exists, and Maybe, in life, it will exist. I prefer not to dwell on these amazing details that explain life itself, and I give a rating of 10/10 for this film, which is the only one that in my life I have taken the time to, in my opinion, evaluate."
10,Masterpiece,"A film masterpiece:a dramatic gangster movie that deals with power, karma, true love. Photography wise, content wise, and music wise it's an absolute classic"
9,Finally after 48 years !,"I finally watch it after 48 years ! What an excellent movie , performance wise each and every character shine in their own way , the twist and turns were amazing !"
8,Very nice,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

10,A masterpiece!,"One of the best gangster movies that have been released.Some people say this it the only good one in the trilogy but I disagree with that statement, although it is the best one. The story and acting are superb. Hell, Marlon Brando as The Godfather is a reason enough to watch this film. It really feels as Coppola had some inside informant give him insight on how things work in a mafia family. They are many other crime movies but in my opinions none of those is on the same level as ""The Godfather""(that's not saying they are bad or of inferior quality of course).

I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, enjoys not only crime flicks but good cinema in general."
1,Glorifying criminals and their lifestyle.,"I really don't understand why some people loved it so much. I agree acting by all actors is outstanding, but this movie is about a crime family and it glorifies the criminals of the society. Criminals are volves of society which prey upon sheep (good people) of the society,they use evil and immoral ways to become rich and powerful. Criminals must not be glorified. Please stop promoting such crime movies. All crimes movies should show a terrible fate of criminal who either has to spend rest of life in jail or is given suitable puinishment for his or her crimes. I did not live the movie as it glorifies lifestyle of criminals."
10,Great movie,"The godfather really shows the image of the Italian mafia, especially the music and characterization"
10,Ok. It is a GOOD film.,"I did not know how good it was until I saw it not so long ago.

Coming back and forth (I am not one to write that much, I am very sorry) with the movie, one of the things which I felt in loved was the Soundtrack and the characters. Our young Al Pacino has at his shoulders such a big role and it is amazing how he makes a good transformation of the character. Marlon Brando, not just only as a actor but his persona makes goosebumps as he is in the room. Someone clearly to respect and admire.

The history looks simple enough but treasures such many things that make you enjoy every minute of it.

It is not for everyone, I got to admit it, It makes me sad in a way to know SO MANY people that have no make it 'till the end of the film."
10,The Godfather of all movies.,"I made my day by watching ""The Godfather"". When i was finished with it i just thought i have now watched The Godfather of all movies. The acting was spectacular. I could not have imagined a Drama movie could be so fun to have watched."
10,The Greatest movie I have EVER seen!,"I have seen movies from all genres, but NOTHING and no other movie has surprised me more than The Godfather! This movie has EVERYTHING, a great script, unforgettable performances and characters, great acting and a MIND-BLOWING story line! I was really surprised on how serious this movie was made and the effort it took to make this into a successful masterpiece! Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is EXCELLENT! I was really enjoying every minute of his screen time and because of his Italian accent and also because he was a very interesting and likable character. The amount of drama that occurs in the film between the five families is absolutely heartbreaking and mind-blowing due to FANTASTIC performances brought to the film! I also really enjoyed Al Pacino's character known as Michael Corleone! I felt that he had a lot of charisma in almost every scene he was in and he tries to avoid being an idiot character and ends up being another likable character throughout the film! I think this is DEFINITELY a film that everybody should see at least once because it is definitely worth a watch for anyone who LOVES watching movies from any genre including myself. The Godfather is a film that HIGHLY surprised me and it's a classic and a masterpiece in movie history and it will stay as one of the GREATEST movie of all time and it has to be the greatest movie I have ever seen and i'm gonna give The Godfather a 10/10."
10,"Simply put, this is the greatest film ever made.","As close to a perfect film as you're going to get. The young, fairly new director(in 1972)Francis Ford Coppola did an outstanding job of getting A+ performances out of his 'entire' cast. When watching this masterpiece of American film, one does not even take notice that they are watching actors perform. Instead, it's as if a hidden camera has captured the real lives of a post war New York mafia family. This is by far my favorite film of all time and recomend it as a must see. I envy the person who will have the thrill of seeing it for the first time. It's quite awsome."
9,Enjoyable but disappointing,"The Godfather seems to be one of the most critically successful films of all time with many people claiming it to be 'the greatest movie of all time'. This makes it impossible to watch this film with a truly open mind. Anyone wait bing this film will most likely have very high expectations for this alleged masterpiece.

The film wasn't bad. The narrative was interesting, the dialogue was clever and it was executed perfectly with some of the greatest acting talent ever seen on screen. It was a good film, a great film in fact but the greatest film of all time? Not quite.

The film felt too long and was at some points hard to watch, almost even boring and although there are few things wrong with the film it just feels as though it is missing something special that would be expected from 'the greatest movie of all time'.

That said the film was somewhat enjoyable however it's reputation left me wanting something more and sadly the prequel films weren't quite that something."
10,Indescribably Special,"Somehow 3 hours seem to flow on by faster than you can imagine. By far, the best directing in any movie I have ever seen. It is unbelievable how separate plotlines weave into one-another so perfectly. Despite being killers every character is so real and understandable. I can imagine living as each character and following the same paths they had as fate dictated. I don't believe that any movie will or has captured the pure magic of this movie. I am fully engage and in awe every time I watch this movie. I follow the stereotype of short attention spans among young people, but I cannot say that I was ever taken out of the movie or bored for even a second from the first line to the last, a feat only achieved by this and The Shawshank Redemption. The only criticism I have ever heard about this movie is that it is too slow, but I don't see it. There are no moments that left me bored, each moment is packed with pure entertainment, and every moment without dialogue or action is filled with incredible music that lets you ponder and digest the events that just transpired. That raises another point in how incredible the music is. The main theme is captivating like I have never seen before. It is so recognizable and unique. It has become a joke among my friends who I initially watched this movie with to play the main theme whenever there is any violence or talk about money. I even hum it without even realizing. I bring this movie up every time I need to make conversation with someone who was old enough to remember the release of this movie. There is something about it that separates it from all other movies. It perfectly entails everything great about movies and is the peak of entertainment."
7,Go on,"John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history."
1,Awful,"People do not understand cinema. I see the movie The Fighter with top stars and sure it gets Oscars or The Godfather oh ya great movie. I just watched a movie called Rockaway (2007). A movie where the main actor is just a normal man. And, yes, he acts normal and looks normal. But the power that can come from a normal man explodes in this movie (Rockaway). The people who rate The Fighter or the Godfather with high ratings or liked it any are people with a low IQ. They probably like these types of movies because cuz they like crime, like the Godfather. The godfather is trash. This little dude in (Rockaway 2007) this movie mostly uses intelligence to take down the mob and its godfather. I cannot stand the movie the godfather because America is praising crime and gangsters. This movie shows how one mans determination to stop a gang of thugs is expelled mostly with intelligence training determination and more. I cannot stand the Oscar and academy award panel- they do not know how to judge films. I will sing to everything good when the day comes and people stop admiring trash like The Fighter and The Godfather. I get a kick out of the movie Rockaway because the character can be a good role model. He is not a criminal, drug addict, and he isn't stupid. When we watch The Fighter, or The Godfather, you see top American actors committing crime, drugs, and utter stupidity. But in Rockaway, a regular American, or hispanic, not sure, man comes back to town to take down the entire Russian mob. He even takes down the Godfather of the mob while he is blind, after his eyes were taken out. I am thankful that I am not stupid enough to be excited when the bad guys (mobsters) win. I am the type of guy that likes to go to work without the mafia trying to get in my way. Mobs and gangsters and their movies just don't excite me, but seeing this high rating, helps me to understand why there is so much crime in America and why most people are too scared to go outside haha."
10,Best film out there,"The godfather is a film that everyone should see once in there life.

The very good at setting in america and Italy are so good, Marlin Brando RIP plays a In unsettling an impressing act as Mob boss."
10,good,"Good plot, good effects for 1970 good actors totally good. I think everyone must watch."
10,the greatest ever,"What a incredible movie, this is the movie of the century, i have watched it three times, 10 out of 10, masterpiece, well deserved Oscar, i loved everything about this movie"
10,Pioneer of Hollywood Movies,"Godfather is the most iconic movies of all time, my most favorite movies of all time. The direction was great, The artists and the acting was incredible . this is my favrite film of all time. Everyone on earth should watch this movie once in a lifetime.

Watching GodFather is just awesome always.."
9,An Offer You Can't Refuse,"A timeless masterpiece. A truly awe inspiring piece of cinema. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Very well directed with dazzling cinematography. Acting was superb and the script was flawless.

I'd recommend this film to anyone, especially those who enjoy Scorsese's work with mobs like Goodfellas and Casino. The film is so enthralling you can not believe it came out in 1972. The camera work and direction of Capolla was truly amazing.

It has such memorable and quotable lines. And another mention of the acting, because Pacino was unbelievable and so convincing as Michael. A defiant masterpiece, everyone should see this movie, at least once."
9,The Godfather,"THE MOST LARGEST FILM THAT COME BACK IN THE CINEMA HISTORY THIS PRINCIPAL WRITTEN MAKES A BOOK OF 1000 QUALIFICATIONS THIS IS NOT A POINTS THAT CAN BE GIVEN ON THE WORLD NATURALISM IN NATURE IN THE INDOOR AIR, Of course it is one of the masterpieces, the masterpiece of the father's film is that the curiosity and the mafia within everybody keeps going on the film in a way that will never break you from the film. Father 1 and father 1 after father 2 in the movie before the father is a father of mafia tells the state. In 3, he tells about his father's life after himself. Alpacino is Alpacino in the film Baba is a film. After Dad's film, he's already taken the wounded face. But many people who know father film do not know wounded film. A wounded face is one of the films that can try a masterpiece among mafia movies in the movie. The point based on the film was the point of importance to the family. How much a man is a father of mafia, there is a family that should look after him. The Godfather, the leader of many mafia leaders, has also opened a new style among the mafia. The Carlin family, which determined an image that would never be destroyed, has entered into legendary films with the father film. The Godfather is adapted from the same book by Mario Puzo. In the film, we will observe the developments around an Italian mafia family living in America, and we will get to know them closely. Michael Corleone, the family's youngest son, who joined the army to get away from her business, who is opposed to her father, takes on the job she does not love to save them from the difficult situation her family falls into. It is not only about getting to work, but it is able to get over all the responsibilities"
6,good but dull,"okay i saw this movie and it isn't really worthy of being in list of top 5 movies. i mean i have seen many movies that are 'much better' than this movie.personally i found this movie to be just about the people who say 'family first' and believe too much in morals and honor. the movie is good but its not really that good to be rated in the top 5 movies.

the movie is slow and very slow and at moments i felt sleepy with those dialogs regarding how one should treat another or how if you do this you wont get porked or whatever. i am rating this 6 for okay-ish plot and good acting."
1,waste of 3 hours,"While The Godfather is often hailed as a masterpiece, I find it to be highly overrated. There's no denying that the actors are professional and the direction is solid, but to label it as the best movie of all time feels excessive. The film is good, but it lacks the elements that would make it truly exceptional in my eyes. The storyline, while iconic, doesn't stand out to me compared to other crime movies that offer more engaging plot twists and intricate narratives. There are countless other films in the crime genre that I believe are superior in terms of storytelling, character development, and overall execution. I think the film's reputation is more about its cultural impact and historical significance rather than its actual quality as a movie. While it may have set a standard during its time, I don't see how it surpasses many other films that have come since. For me, it's a decent movie, but far from deserving of the overwhelming praise it receives. I give it a low rating because I find the hype around it to be disproportionate to its actual merits."
9,Subtle,"The Godfather (including Part 2 for purpose of this review) is probably the most analysed film of all time, so really I don't see the point in repeating any of the rhetorics. Rather, what I intend to provide here is my honest two cents of this film.

The Godfather is not an easy film to watch, so it baffled me at that time of watching for the first time (and still baffles me to this day) how it is so universally loved by almost anyone who has watched it. Firstly, there are so many characters that I gave up remembering anyone other than the Corleone family. Secondly, the script is so subtle and tight that the moment I missed a single sentence, I did not get the next scene. It was no easy feat to follow every sentence given the frequent mutterings, so subtitles are almost indispensable. In the end, I pretty much referred to the plot synopsis every 5 minutes.

Make no mistake, the reasons above are also what probably makes the Godfather regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It just surprises me how a film as subtle as the Godfather has received just as much attention as 'lighter' classics such as Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc.

Ultimately, my verdict is that the Godfather is a great, iconic film from the 70s era, but my honest take is that the Godfather is perhaps a little over-hyped (not overrated, but over-hyped) to the extent that it gets more exposure than some of the other equally great films from the olden era. For that, the Godfather is a great film, but is not in my consideration for the greatest film of all time."
8,Love this movie but...,I love this movie but hate me if you will the second is better. Just facts!
10,A Classic and Great Movie of all time,"I watched the movie so many time. Each time I watch, I learn something new. The movie shows the principal of life. There are things that we need to respect. There are things that we need to sacrifice. There are things that we need to learn how to wait.

It's a movie that talks about a big Mafia family but not just that. When I go out too often, I always think of this movie when the godfather asked his son did he eat at home with family? if not, he is not a real man.

There are a lot of great things you can learn from the movie. A classic that you must watch!"
10,The Greatest,One of the greatest movies of all time. The cast & characters were perfect.
10,****,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film."
10,Perfect,"The best gangster movie of all times. A can't miss movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are spectacular and give an excellent performance. If anyone wants to know how Mafia lived, this is the best example to see. Marlon Brando stars as Vito Corleone is purely a Don. The soundtracks are great although sometimes the movie is sometimes slow, but keeps the interest and excitement in you throughout the whole movie. In this movie Michel Corleone(Pacino) makes his way into his family's business to protect his father and himself until he becomes the new Don. Francis Ford Cappola made the right decisions in casting especially with Pacino although all the oppositions he had with the producers."
8,It's a great movie to watch but not the greatest movie.,"When I listened from my friends that this movie is a master piece and I saw that Metacritic has given it a100% than I thought that this is a true master piece. But when I saw the movie,I felt that it's a great movie but not the greatest, as we should have some idea of the novel before watching it,so as to know what is happening in the movie ,also we don't know when the time is passing in the movie because they don't show after how many years is a event occuring in the movie (If you are confused of what I am talking about then you should see the movie). However the performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is out standing and the direction of the movie is fabulous. And when you see this crime drama you never feel that the movie is stretched upto 3hrs. However, it's my opinion about this movie ,according to me ,go for it and I promise you that that you will watch a great holly wood classic that will not disappoint you."
10,impatient and a little insecure,"""I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."""
2,Vastly Over-rated,"The Godfather is an engaging and compelling story to say the least, but as a movie- so what? Just because something makes for a great story or play doesn't mean it can automatically translate onto the big screen. There has to be some point of making it into a movie, and quite frankly, The Godfather works just as effectively as a book. The characters, the dialogue, the plot twists- yeah, they're all okay, but where are the shots, the angles, the editing techniques, the sound effects that make this into a number one film??? The conventions of film are all used pretty simply according to the Hollywood format- ie, make the camera invisible. There are few scenes anywhere in The Godfather Trilogy that stand out in the history of cinema. If you want an entertaining movie, you will certainly like the Godfather. But you may just as well read the book (unless, like so many today, you haven't the time). But if you want a film that stretches the genre or that will blow you away with an element OTHER than storyline and dialogue, you can do a lot better."
10,Best. Movie. Ever.,"I didn't know movies could be this perfect. The acting, the story line, and the cinematography are superb. How much more can I write?"
10,Best movie ever,"Its simply incredible. By far the best movie I've ever watched. The way in which it makes you sympathize with the characters, even when knowing they are gangsters, or the perfect dialogues that we hear from the characters. It's simply perfect. The character development couldn't be better, specially the work they did on Michael. And to top it off, the ending scene is simply a masterpiece. I know that the thought of it being 3 hours long is scary at the beginning, but it will be the best 3 hours of your life. It is a movie that everyone should watch, as it is an essential part of modern culture and is simply too good to be skipped. Simply a masterpiece, highly recommend it."
10,An offer that can not be rejected,"There is a class of hell to hold people who refuse the offer to see this movie.

,This film is by far the best film ever made, I, who do not get tired of watching it, its unique soundtrack and narrator of the ups and downs of human life, I learned many lessons for a better life and knowing people from the great Don Corlione I suggest you watch this movie."
10,No words can give the justice that this movie deserves,The story....the cinematography...and the actors! And ol the actors are at there best. Line after line and the inesity that makes part of the family through out this film. You relate to them in a way that you root for the gangster
10,the best movie ever !!!,"Siciliano rules,this movie shows a way of lifestyle"
6,Coool,"It insists upon itself. Love the actors however, Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duval and plus. I myself have not seen this film until my 20s, I am still a youngster and i have much to learn regarding what exactly makes a film a great film, weather it be actors, camera work, great writing. I didn't want to check it out because it has been said its been the one of the greatest gangster films of all time. Thought it was just a film the was blown up and given so much praise because its what it is, The Godfathers. I finally gave it a shot and, although great i did not care to view the sequels. Maybe i will one day, but for now I am not to thrilled to check them out."
3,The Godfather supremacy has been broken by the Ring.,"The Godfather supremacy has been broken by the Ring.

The Godfather is a wonderful film, but it is not the best trilogy ever, at least not anymore. Let me give you a hint why the trilogy of Lord of the Rings is better than the Godfather trilogy. Godfather part III a big time loser!!!

You don't even have to be a fanatic filmgoer to see and realize that. The movie was clumsy and boring to a point that it was almost clear to me that Coppola wanted desperately to make his trilogy without having a clue of what he was doing. That reminds me of another 80'ties character called George Lucas (see Star Wars-saga). Maybe Coppola was trying to take the quote from Alfred Hitchcock a bit too literally, when he said that style in film is to plagiarise yourself. Godfather III is a recollection of scenes we saw before in a different outfit, adding some cheap cosa nostra crap that did not work, like the fake set-up scene with the helicopter. This is the moment where by unbelievable coincidence the Godfather and Sonny's son came out without a scratch. This is not the same kind of realism I saw in I and II. While Return of the King is the climatic moment of the trilogy, Godfather III was its lowpoint.

This is Hollywood wanting to sell tickets the cheap way, betting on a sure thing. And what about the story? What is it? Financial corruption at the Vatican? It is nothing more than an expensive soap-opera. So what if he did it the traditional way. He should of realized that he had no good story.

It is not because the actors from the Godfather trilogy received Oscars for their performances and probably LOTR not is because the actors from the first trilogy did a better job than the others. It has nothing to do with it. The whole show is not about rewarding talent, but to uphold a tradition of celebrating those who are loyal to the spirit of Hollywood. LOTR has but conformed to one tradition, the one from Middle-Earth, in a galaxy far far from Hollywood.

Let's not forget however to point out that Coppola is responsible for putting his daughter in the film who given us a stunning insight in how bad acting can be. Fortunately for her she has proven, she is much better off directing films. Even Pacino doesn't bring a good performance. While in Godfather II he brought us a believable and likeable anti-hero, while in part III he doesn't do anything else than shouting.

There are unforgettable scenes in the Godfather trilogy. But so there are far better scenes in LOTR, and probably in a way future generations will get inspired in how to make a sensible symbiosis between technique and story, in the same spirit of Hitchcock and Welles, who both were neglected by The Academy of Motion Pictures. If you talk about memorable scenes, look at how Peter Jackson brought us Gollem. It brakes again new boundaries for visual effects and surpasses even the matrix by far. Phantasy has never been that real since ever. And the examples could go on and on.

Part III doesn't bring anything new, while LOTR innovate at every turn. LOTR is not the typical Hollywood film. In fact, it is not a Hollywood film at all. But It is a pure refreshing experience and a great motivation for a lot of young filmmakers."
10,The Cream Of All Mobster Movies,"""The Godfather"" is, in my opinion, the best gangster movie ever created. I like this movie for its superior directing and excellent storytelling. This movie shows us that even gangsters are born human beings. They face victory and defeat about as much as any other group of people. Despite its graphic intensity, I found myself paying very close attention to the emotions of the main family. I'd say that it is a step above ""The Untouchables"". Anyone interested in major film classics should see the original ""Godfather"" at least one time."
10,The classic tale of a Mafia family. Not for kids.,"Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo bring the famed-mafia novel to life. The Godfather is an excellent portrayal of power, betrayal and family. Beautifully written and stunningly executed, the film is a landmark motion picture with stunning performances (Brando, Pacino, Caan) that is still held up to this day as a timeless classic. Spectacular. Every time I see it, it gets better. From its flawless direction, to its exceptional score, to its (near-)flawless script, I have no doubt ""The Godfather"" is one of the best movies ever made."
10,"No movie can get any better than ""The Godfather""","A Masterpiece of its time and all time, this movie defined the term - ""blockbuster movie"" and set the ultimate limit for a cinematic masterpiece. No one would have ever believed that this movie would have such an impact on popular, mainstream American cinema. The executives of the studio that funded this movie's production just seemed to keep their fingers crossed and hoped that the movie wouldn't bomb really bad in the box office. Their fears were not unreal. They were taking a mammoth risk by funding a movie to be directed by a 'risk taking, not so popular' director starring many unknown actors in major roles and to top it all, the story was to be adapted from a decently popular fictional novel. All these factors could have kept this movie down. If it weren't for the amazing talent exploited really very well in every department, aspect of the movie, their worst fears would have been realized. ""The Godfather"" established many careers and gave life to many interesting personalities to have ever graced the screen. A ""Definite Watch"" for anyone who wants to know what a 'perfect, no non-sense movie' is all about and also in general, an engrossing movie that grows on you over time."
10,i love it,"This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
10,The Godfather (1972) is the Godfather of the films!,"Good movie. I thought it was cool! In addition to having a lot of action, there is a lot of drama. The Godfather is the best movie ever, Michael Kyle said. In my opinion it is the best."
9,part 1 is the best,"This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
7,the best,"This movie was amazing. I watched this movie several times a day and night. In fact, it was very exciting"
1,a classic!,"I am a teenager, and i never thought of finding The Godfather so interesting! It shows a vivid and perfect example of the words Classic and Timeless in a movie. The Godfather takes you to different heights with each scene, directed of course, by Francis Ford Coppola.

Marlon Brando plays one of his funniest (for me, anyway) and greatest role. Al Pacino is another worth mentioning, the acting and the presentation of both actors are some of the key success of the Godfather. Having seen the movie, makes me want to pick up the book! If you need a break from all the recent ""typical movies"", then watch The Godfather."
9,The Godfather,"This one of the best movies, highly marked as an exceptional film, having an excellent story, interconnected with the actors to bring life of the movie.

Big budget film, with an excellent actors and of course locations.

Dressing, prop and set-up with high standards, for this type of movie.

Mafia, described as an enclosed family, with hierarhichal atributions within the members, no excuses and truly powerful.

Superb montage, genre alongside side with gangsta characteristics combining powerful elements, scenarios and time.

Probably it will be seen by few more generations, being a good example of how movies are made."
8,Great movie,"""The first time I watched The Godfather, I was a teenager, and honestly, I didn't appreciate it as much as I should have. At the time, I found the pacing too slow and didn't fully grasp the depth of the story or its significance. I dismissed it as something that wasn't for me and moved on.

However, after revisiting the film 20 years later, I decided to give it another chance, and I have to admit, I was completely wrong in my initial judgment. Watching it now with more life experience, I can truly appreciate the brilliance of the storytelling, the deliberate pacing, and the intricate character development. Every scene serves a purpose, and what once seemed slow to me now feels like a masterpiece of tension, emotion, and complexity.

The Godfather is not just a movie, but a profound exploration of power, loyalty, and family. I'm glad I gave it a second chance because it has become one of my favorite films, and I finally understand why it's considered one of the greatest of all time."""
10,The Greatest Of All Time - Classic,"The Godfather"" is not just a crime drama; it's a profound exploration of morality and the consequences of one's choices. It's a film that continues to influence and inspire generations of filmmakers and remains a must-see for anyone who appreciates the art of cinema. In summary, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of iconic, and his performance sets the tone for the entire film

The film's storytelling is masterful, with a gripping narrative that spans generations of the Corleone family. The intricate web of relationships, loyalty, and betrayal is portrayed with such depth that it keeps you engaged from start to finish."
10,Great movie,"I learned a lot of thing from this movie.

I love the Godfather movies. They are some of the best films ever made. The story, the acting, the music, the cinematography, everything is just perfect. The Godfather movies show us the complex and fascinating world of the mafia, and how it affects the lives of the Corleone family. The Godfather movies are not just about crime and violence, they are also about loyalty, honor, family, and power. The Godfather movies are great because they make us feel a range of emotions, from fear to admiration, from sadness to joy, from anger to sympathy. The Godfather movies are great because they are timeless classics that will never get old."
10,A masterpiece that presents a dark mafia movie with a meaningful family drama at its core.,"This film is utterly brilliant in every possible way, from the character arcs to the dramatic and emotional moments. I won't say much about the plot; only that you need to watch this movie immediately if you haven't already so that you can experience its greatness firsthand. The brilliance of this movie lies in the fact that there are no ""heroes"" or ""villains."" Only people who do what they believe is right for themselves and their families, even if it means going against the rest of the world. I'm honestly not exaggerating when saying that this movie is quite possibly the best film I have ever watched."
10,Very good movie for long afternoons,"When you want to see a good movie, you have to see this one. The script, the actors, just whole the film is incredible. It takes about three hours but it's done before you know. Everyone I know loved it, and I know many people."
7,A conflicting masterpiece,"Yes. I gave the movie a 7 out of 10.

I do acknowledge that the movie is a masterpiece that defined future mafia/gangster movies and even cinema as a whole, and I do very much enjoy the well-played characters in the movie where Brando and Pacino were the stars of the show.

However I couldn't help but feel like the movie stretched on for too long. It's not because I have anything against longer movies, hell, I loved Oppenheimer when I watched it in 2023. Maybe it was the fact that it was an older movie that often used a slower pace to build up tension. Maybe I have become numb to quality movies because of the Marvel and action movies that come out today? Who knows.

Nevertheless I still very much enjoyed this movie. I can see why it is seen as a masterpiece, most definitely."
9,Nearly flawless,"This movie is truly a masterpiece. It is nearly flawless, and was remarkably realistic. No need for mob stereotypes ..... Just a conservative portrayal of a family with deep roots. Remarkable, and a treat to watch over again. It's too bad Brando was a bit of a flake, because he is probably the best actor that ever lived. Every character is complex, but I think my favourite must be Sonny. A hot headed son who is expected to take the reigns of the family one day, in spite of older brother Fredo. I was a kid when it came out but I would love to see it on the big screen. I also find the ages of the actors interesting... Pacino and Caan were very close in age despite Caan as being portrayed as years older. Duvall is actually considerably older than those two. And Abe Vagota is the oldest living cast member."
10,Brilliant!,"What more could you ever want from a film?! The Godfather, created by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolutely mind boggling film. The acting is brilliant! Brando, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall are masterful actors. The topic, the mafia, fascinating. The motif and symbolism (shaded eyes, oranges for death), stunning and so well presented. The transitions (edition), genius. Most of all, watch for the wonderful cinematography...Coppola knows how to shoot a hell of a film! I personally don't believe any other film can compare to this movie. Truly a masterpiece and revolutionary in setting higher standards in filmmaking."
9,good picture,"Hawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners,"
10,An aspiring classic and one of the most memorable in cinema,"From a stand point, The Godfather is one of the most epic and flawless Movies to be ever made. Everything from the direction to the fantastic art style and tone, this film is amazing. Here's why this is one of the most influential Movies today.

The story is great, in the 1940s, an aging patriarch is getting tired of his job and constantly struggles through Family life until he gets shot by a criminal, due to his damage on his chest, his son Michael Corloene takes over as patriarch and must infiltrate a series of criminals and live a New life in Sicily but the criminals Michael is looking for is after him and his Associates, With that in mind, he must protect everyone from this nasty spree from happening and have both New York and Sicily back in business.

The film's direction is a miracle, the film really is a serious gangster drama than most drama's With a touch of humor, this film has none of that, each character has the own respective emotion which makes the character more like a Virtual reality game than a fictional character in a Movie since the characters are portrayed realistically and that makes the film bring more attention to the Viewer than it's general audience.

The performances are fantastic especially Al Pacino, they really act like real life People which makes their acting skills nearly improvised, i must confess that Marlon Brando can sounds kinda wheezy and talks to quiet, but he is good but Al Pacino is the star of this Movie.

The art style is great, the film has a Perfect use of film grain and color which makes the film looks more realistic and appealing than usual.

The film is without it's problems, but pretty minor, the film's story can get to complex sometimes but that's a nitpick, other than that, the film is flawless.

The Music is great, sounds just like what a gangster soundtrack should be.

The Godfather is one of the best films of all time, the direction, soundtrack, performances, art style, story and it's emotions to it's characters make's this film appealing, the film's too complex but still don't overlook this Movie.

10/10"
10,Perfection.,"""The Godfather"" is a pinnacle of cinematographic excellence, evident in its meticulous attention to detail and masterful execution. Three specific examples highlight the film's brilliance:

The Opening Scene: The film's iconic opening sequence sets the tone for the entire narrative. As Amerigo Bonasera pleads for justice for his daughter, the camera slowly zooms in on his face, capturing every flicker of emotion in Marlon Brando's performance. The use of close-up shots emphasizes the intensity of Bonasera's desperation, while the stark lighting creates a sense of foreboding. This scene establishes the film's themes of power, loyalty, and justice, laying the foundation for the story that unfolds.

The Wedding Sequence: The wedding scene is a masterclass in visual storytelling, showcasing Francis Ford Coppola's ability to orchestrate complex ensemble shots. The sprawling mise-en-scène captures the opulence of the Corleone family's world, with the camera weaving through the crowd, introducing key characters and relationships. The use of long takes and fluid camera movements creates a sense of intimacy and immersion, drawing viewers into the festivities. Meanwhile, subtle details in the background, such as the whispered conversations and exchanged glances, hint at the underlying tensions simmering beneath the surface.

The Restaurant Murder: One of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history, the restaurant murder is a tour de force of suspense and tension. Shot from Michael Corleone's perspective, the scene unfolds in real-time, intensifying the sense of immediacy and danger. The use of low-key lighting and deep shadows heightens the atmosphere of dread, while the absence of music accentuates the sound of the train rumbling overhead. As Michael calmly executes his plan, the camera remains steady, capturing every calculated movement and expression. The scene's shocking climax, punctuated by the sudden eruption of violence, leaves an indelible impression on viewers, solidifying ""The Godfather"" as a cinematic masterpiece."
10,Good but not great,Good movie but Petro Balbao better movie. thanks -kristot
10,Masterpiece,"Direction and Production As a passionate film enthusiast, I can't help but marvel at the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. His ability to craft an immersive narrative that captivates the audience from the very first scene is truly exceptional. Coppola's talent for developing complex, multifaceted characters is evident in every frame, using cinematography that shifts between light and shadow to symbolize the moral duality of the characters. His choice to shoot many scenes in dimly lit interiors adds a tone of mystery and danger, underscoring the clandestine nature of the Corleone family's activities.

The production of ""The Godfather"" also stands out for its meticulous attention to detail and authenticity. The recreation of mid-20th century New York is flawless, from the costumes and sets to the music selection, which includes traditional Italian pieces that add an extra layer of realism and emotion to the narrative.

Performances The performances in ""The Godfather"" are nothing short of legendary. Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, delivers an iconic performance that defines the mafia patriarch with a blend of toughness and humanity. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, cementing his place in cinematic history. Brando manages to convey an imposing authority while showing a touching vulnerability, especially in scenes with his family.

Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, undergoes a masterful transformation from a reluctant, innocent young man to a calculating mafia boss. The evolution of his character is handled with impressive subtlety, and his ability to convey deep internal changes with minimal facial expressions showcases his immense talent. Michael's relationship with his family, especially his father Vito, is the emotional core of the film and is executed with an authenticity that deeply resonates with the audience.

Script and Themes The script, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is a work of art in itself. It balances the complexity of organized crime with family dynamics, presenting a story that is both intimate and epic. The dialogues are sharp and memorable, filled with lines that have become part of cultural lexicon, like ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""

The themes of ""The Godfather"" are universal and timeless. The film explores power and corruption, the cost of leadership and loyalty, and the struggle between family duty and personal ambition. These themes, presented with emotional depth and rich narrative, make the film transcend its genre to become a meditation on human nature and society.

Legacy As a lifelong fan of cinema, I can't overstate the impact ""The Godfather"" has had on popular culture and the film industry. It has influenced countless movies and TV series, setting a standard for crime and family stories. Its critical and commercial success, with multiple Academy Awards, is a testament to its enduring quality.

In summary, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines visionary direction, exceptional performances, and an impeccable script to create a powerful and emotionally resonant narrative. It is a film that remains relevant and cherished, a true gem of the seventh art that continues to inspire generations of filmmakers and viewers. For anyone who loves cinema as much as I do, ""The Godfather"" is not just a movie-it's an experience, a benchmark, and a timeless classic."
7,Good ideas from the novel presented in an average way,"Another oddity in my collection, it is an overrated piece similar to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Schindler's List' although much more watchable I have to say. In the end there are too many ridiculous scenes and poor acting that undersells the overall arching plot.

Some strange things I have to ask within the first hour. Why does Don Corleone buy fruit in some craphole edge of the road stall? Why two oranges and a pepper? When the hitmen run towards him he does nothing to defend himself, yet he knows they are gunning for him. They shoot over 6 rounds into him and he, as an old man, survives and is placed into intrusive care?

What the hell writing is this? Or perhaps this is more a failing in direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Michael Corleone finds out his father was shot by walking around the street and finding a newspaper with something on it? What? Not a phone call or something that makes sense?

This is then followed by Sonny Corleone getting a phone call of the shooting. Why not Michael? What is going on there? Then Sonny writes a note with a pen on the kitchen cabinet door? What the hell? Not a piece of paper or just remember the facts, but he writes on the cabinet door?

This is awful. The script is nonsensical and the attention to irrelevant details is what boggles my mind. I think simple minded people think that is fascinating or something but it doesn't hold up the suspension of disbelief for me.

What I like from this film is the slow pace and burn. The conflict from the family turf war is gritty and well done. I love that David Chase, like many, took some inspiration from this movie and put a lot of details into 'The Sopranos'. But this movie itself is above average, well made, but full of plot holes and useless tat that could have been cut down to a tight film. The movie 'Goodfellas' has served more inspiration to filmmakers and popular culture than this title did.

Scenes such as the ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" one aren't as great as people claim. In this film it is just an afterthought that was captured on film. Nothing special in the way scenes like that were shot or presented, just bog average really.

The best part of this film is the transformation of Michael Corleone, it is good writing. But of course that came from the book, didn't it. This starts to get interesting at just before the hour mark. The murder scene is good but something is off about it. The wine cork pop is a joke, surely? The hit itself was well done, and showed at least how a hit should be done. But the bit of fanfare music is over the top and then a strange piano solo music to accompany the scenes thereafter? They use the garbage spinning newspaper montage like 'Citizen Kane' did, and it is lazy in my opinion.

Then plot then send Micahel off to Italy, which is ridiculous. The about turn in tone is off putting and thereafter I always lose interest. Somehow he gets married to an Italian girl and then becomes boss so suddenly. This is bad writing and happens too fast. Don Corleone in Italy running around with a small child in the tomatoes was ridiculous and over the top; stomping through the tomatoes like Goddzilla, then dies.

The end 30 minutes with Michael running things is again, over the top and ridiculous. He spent his whole life in school and the military, he knows jack diddly about the family and now they show him running everything on his own.

Whatever people say is great about this film, I question with more thought. It is not awful but it is certainly not a masterpiece. For gangster movies I prefer 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', and of course 'The Sopranos' is the best written title ever created.

7/10 a good movie though nonsensical at times with above average filming."
4,Didn´t like very much,"A bad movie, just lots of conversation for 3 hours, and little action."
10,the best mafia film ever made,"The truly amazing performance by Marlon Brando as the ageing mob-boss Vito Corleone is not the only stroke of brilliance in this film. The performance by the then young Al Pacino as the youngest son Micheal was also first class. His portrayal as a young man, recently out of the army, who was determined to stay well out of his fathers business but through a series of events transformed is quite stunning. Far greater than part two and one of the best films ever made. Supported by great performances by Robert Duvall as the families adopted son and lawyer Tom Hagen and James Caan as Vito's psychotic eldest son Sonny, Brando's portrayal comes believingly to life in this fantastic film."
10,Simply the greatest film ever made!!!!!!!!,"There really isn't much you can say about The Godfather because it is simply the best movie ever made and anyone who says otherwise knows nothing about films. The storyline is superb, the actors are excellent and the music is good too. I thought Al Pacino should have gotten something for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. Funny how he never got a Golden Globe or Oscar for this part but yet it's that character that he is known for most. Francis Ford Coppola got this production perfect down to the smallest detail. This movie is truly a work of art and no other film has even come close to its stature. It is a triumph no other movie has been able to recreate! Everybody around the world must see this film at least once!"
10,The Godfather is best movies,"It has been observed that the women's roles are negligible in this movie: Kay is naïve, and Michael's wife in Sicily is little more than eye candy. The other wives are not active players in the movie either. But to say that this is not about something is to misjudge the film."
10,Powerful hard hitting masterpiece!,"You may of heard that the godfather is meant to be this huge hitting box office Oscar winning best movie ever made, well it is. But you need to be one of those people who accept movies and like them for what they are, as the godfather lasts for over 3 hours. It never gets boring and is a huge surprise in the movie industry. It is great powerful and well acted. The certain kind of movie that shouldnt be missed. The story surrounds the Corleone family. There lives in the mafia world. It will leave you shocked when yo watch this movie. Don't miss it if you love movies. This is now known as the ""all time best movie ever"" And its great and fun to watch.

10/10

If you like this i recomend Goodfellas, a great movie that comes close.

The Godfather is great see the whole collection ""Classic""!"
10,CINE,La mejor película que haya visto nunca ... sin más
2,"The GodFather? More like thE NodFather (as in I would rather be nodding off on Heroine than watching this crummy, cheap movie)","Man. This movie has got to be even worse than Chitizen Kane. Martin De Niro really brings the pain with this cheap, crummy piece of tripe that was produced very cheaply and boringly. More like the NodFather. It's soooo boring. They called it ""Gangstarr movie"" but Ice Cube and 2 pac arent even in it yet! I want my 40+ Years back.

Marilyn Brando? Who's that? And Al Pachino hasnent even started to turn into a Turkey yet! Thats his only good feature! What a cheap, boring piece of movie that probably isn't even as good as home made movies on youtube.

I generously give this movie a 2 star rating due to the fact that it was the first not black and white movie, so really they had no idea what they were doing it;s really just a victim of the times, so we got to hate the players and not the game and just becaue this movie sucks and has no context whatsoever and superheroes werent invented yet I shouldnt be so generous bt I take suypathy to Robert Schorscesesesesssy and (god rest his soul) give it 2 starts."
9,Absolutely amazing! The greatest movie I've ever seen...,"I can say that this isn't just good movie, it's amazing, it's not just one of the best, it's the best movie I've ever seen. What an idea, what a music, what a brave of characters in this movie. I read book of Mario Puzo a year ago, all the movies in this trilogy I had seen for 3-4 years. Book is also great, but I definitely like movie much. Sometimes I compare it to ""Once upon a time in America"", there is such an idea I think, but greater is Godfather I mean. 10 stars out 10. I didn't give such a point to any movie... Still the best however I have seen about 100-150 movies. I don't think something will change for me in future so Godfather will be the greatest one for me."

10,A RATING YOU CANT REFUSE,"A masterpiece in 600 words. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is near perfect. A film you can show a non fan and have the completely invested in every character. A three hour movie that isn't long enough, perfectly paced with drama and action.

The plot (non spoilers) The story of a mafia family in the 1940s. Don Vito Corleone is the boss of one of the 5 families of the New York mafia. He has three sons. Sonny, the oldest and most ill tempered. Fredo, the insecure weak on that no one takes seriously. Michael, the youngest and smartest but wants nothing to do with the family business. Through the events of the family, Michael finds himself involved with the criminal side of the family.

Synopsis The greatest example of a man's turn from clean cut model citizen to cold blooded crime boss of organized crime. A movie that every person must watch in their lifetime. Also watch PART 2. Just as good in a different way."
8,Great and stable Acting,The acting and expressions from all the characters go perfectly with the Plot and Jonour of the Movie
9,Another Don' Roaming.,"Incoming hot take: It's good.

I watched ""The Offer"" a few weeks back and since then decided that it's high time that I watched ""The Godfather"" again, for the first time in what must be a couple of decades. It's a really perfect balance of interesting performances and a gripping story.

Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) turns down the opportunity to move his crime family into the lucrative narcotics business post-WW2. An attempt on his life leads to his hot-headed son, Sonny (James Caan) taking temporary control of the organisation whilst consiglieri Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) tries to stop the escalation to all out war. Vito's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino) a decorated war hero, commits a murder on behalf of his brother and then heads to Italy to avoid retaliation.

You almost don't need to watch ""The Godfather"" again, so many of its lines, moments and scenes are iconic to all of pop culture that they are embedded in the consciousness. Brando is never quite as broad as the impressions make out to be, and though some lines are difficult to hear, there's a subtly to it that can be overlooked. It's mostly Michael's story though, as he rises to become the new Don from not being in the family business at all at the opening wedding. For me, this is still Al Pacino's best performance. Visually it's excellent, the score is another iconic aspect of the enterprise. It's just a great film. A perfect blend of commercial and artistic endeavours.

Being slightly more critical, it does introduce us to lots of characters and later refer to them by name only, eventually though these problems ease out and you learn who to focus on. John Cazale is slightly underutilised, but he would return for a bigger role in the sequel.

Speaking of, looking forward to rewatching that second film at some point soon."
10,Best movie ever!,"What more is there to say that hasn't been said? This is hands down my favorite movie of all time? ""The Godfather"" stands as an enduring testament to the power of storytelling and filmmaking. Widely regarded as the greatest movie of all time, this cinematic gem has transcended its genre, leaving an indelible mark on both the film industry and popular culture. Several elements contribute to its status as the pinnacle of cinematic achievement.

At the heart of the movie is a compelling narrative that unfolds with meticulous precision. Mario Puzo's source material, combined with Coppola's adept screenplay, weaves a tale of power, family, and betrayal. The film effortlessly navigates the complex dynamics of the Corleone crime family, delving into the intricacies of their relationships, both familial and criminal. The narrative unfolds in a series of interconnected events, creating a rich tapestry that captivates the audience from start to finish. Central to the film's success are its iconic characters, brought to life by an ensemble cast delivering career-defining performances. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary, a nuanced and powerful performance that earned him an Academy Award. Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader as Michael Corleone is a masterclass in character development. The ensemble, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale, complements the leads, creating a memorable cast of characters that have become archetypes in cinematic history. The women in the film are very under-appreciated and deserve more recognition, including Simonetta Stefani as Apollonia, Diane Keaton as Kay-Addams Corleone, and Talia Shire as Connie Corleone. Coppola's directorial brilliance is evident in every frame of the film. The film's cinematography, led by Gordon Willis, is a visual symphony, employing a rich color palette and innovative techniques to evoke the mood and tone of each scene. The iconic use of shadows and low-lighting techniques adds a layer of sophistication, heightening the film's sense of drama. The wedding scene, with its dynamic ensemble cast, is a testament to Coppola's ability to orchestrate complex sequences with finesse. The hauntingly beautiful score composed by Nino Rota is a character in itself, evoking a sense of melancholy and foreboding. The main theme, synonymous with the film, has become synonymous with organized crime in popular culture. The music serves as an emotional anchor, heightening the impact of key moments and leaving an indelible imprint on the viewer's psyche. Beyond its critical acclaim, this has left an enduring impact on global culture. Phrases like ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" have permeated everyday conversation. Other iconic films that people quote on a daily basis include ""Look how they massacred my boy"" which has become memed. The film's influence extends beyond the screen, shaping perceptions of organized crime and influencing subsequent generations of filmmakers. Beyond this movie being art, it is also a crowd-pleaser all thanks to its fast-pace even for drama standards. The movie makes sure it can be accessible to everyone and not just cinephiles. It has the rewatchability factor as well.

So overall, this is not merely a film, it is a cinematic opus that has stood the test of time. Its masterful storytelling, iconic characters, cinematic prowess, evocative score, and cultural impact collectively make it the quintessential movie experience. As it continues to be celebrated and studied, The Godfather remains an immortal masterpiece, rightfully earning its place as the best movie of all time."
10,MASTERPIECE,The Godfather is one of the best films in the history. No more comments. Go to the couch and see it for yourself. Enjoy it.
7,good movie to watch,"very good and impressive movie, it's very glad to see this show. everybody have to watch this, therefore any time you see this you will learn new stuff.so be happy every moment in your life, nothing impossible if you want to learn so there is nothing important, money market securities are usually more widely traded than longer term securities and so tend to be more liquid, banks actively use money market to earn interest on surplus funds that they expect to have only temporarily. Review articles in academic journals analyze or discuss research previously published by others, rather than reporting new experimental results.The concept of ""review article"" is separate from the concept of peer-reviewed literature. It is possible for a review article itself to be peer-reviewed or non-peer-reviewed."
1,"I just don't get? it was I supposed to of cried, been scared or something else?","Whilst I'm sure I could easily get frustrated by its popularity, and perhaps the popularity of it gave me to high expectation, after all it felt like a movie from the 40s or 30s whilst I guess I was expecting something with this popularity to be in some way revolutionary, although I do appreciate Hitchcock and so forth.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I spent a lot of it confused as to it appeal. The caricatures where undeniably very emotionally uncompelling. Maybe the dramatic flaw was there to be realistic, if that is what forensic physiology implies but I don't know, but it still gave all the sad moments a detached fell and because it followed so many people I don't feel I had time to trust them. I suppose if it only follow one chariture like the series Ripely that could of been I starting point.

Most of all I guess my biggest question that I suppose might shut me up is what was this supposed to make me feel about the mafia. Naturally if it was a glorification then same on them but I suppose if I tried to make me empathize with victims of the mafia then I guess I can respect that even if it defiantly hasn't worked in my case because I have to ask.

To summaries what was I supposed to feel and how one earth dose this movie accomplish that? I am geniuenly asking."
10,Unquestioned masterpiece of 70's cinema,"I am not going to get into extensive detail on how great this film is, hundreds if not thousands before me have already done so and to good credit. As a Hollywood director has once previously stated on another non-Godfather film commentary track, watching the film is a cinema class in of its self... if you are going to watch only one film in your life, it is this one. I must agree, I watch this film repeatedly, not only to be entertained but also to study as a filmmaker myself. Obviously the many directors who turned down the assignment to direct this adapted script had a strong moral objection to glorify the mafia, and I agree, there is absolutely ""nothing"" glamorous about real life gangsters in organized crime. But this is a fictional tale and Coppola used his own strong Italian American heritage to infuse the film with far greater themes and family bonding than any of the other directors originally approached would have done. He raised this film from the exploitative gangster flick that it was slotted to be by the studio, even wanting to change the novel's 1940's setting to modern day to save money on the budget, to that of Shakespearian levels and the best example of film art in Hollywood films. Coppola well deserved the Oscar, fame and the money that followed the film's release, in my opinion anyway. Perhaps it is because I saw this film as a youngster and accepted the film as is, as many others I watched, good and cheesy, but watching it even now there doesn't seem to be a single bad shot or angle in the entire film, except one.... Diane Keaton's false ""double-take"" reaction to the exploded vehicle in the back ground when she is confronted by Tom as she returns to the Mall to see Michael. It always takes me out of the film."
10,Terrific,"Best movie of all time, I watched it more than 10 times and every time that I watch this movie I like it more and more."
10,Reflection,"Rest in peace, godfather. It's just, I have to correct you. Even though you don't spend much time with your family, you're still a real man. Because your role has taught countless boys to become men. For this reason alone, I will always respect you."
10,Masterpiece,"A work of art, nothing more to add, a very captivating film and a reference in its genre. Everyone should see it at least once in their lives, as it is a cultural heritage for all humanity that should be seen at least once. At first I was reluctant to see it, as it seemed very long and boring, but when I decided to watch it completely the first time I was totally captivated and amazed by such a tremendous work of art. The sequel is very good as well, but the first of the saga is undoubtedly the best of all, not necessarily for audiovisual quality or other aspects, but because it marked a before and after."
10,Godfather I,A Classic...the best movie ever. Ranks #1 with me for all time great
10,the greatest,"What can I say other than this is the greatest film ever made. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is exquisite. The screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo is very rich in detail. The best thing about the movie however is the cast. Whoever was casting director on this film did a fantastic job. I mean, Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Keaton, Cazale...they all deserved one big Oscar. 10/10"
7,User Reviews,The god father movie is a gangster movie. hide spoilers
4,Overrated film,"One problem I have with the godfather it lacked tension cause I was pretty bored throughout the whole film. Nothing really going on in the movie that capture my attention maybe beside the one scene where Al pacino gf died in a car explosion. Im all for dialogue between characters if done right but this one I can't see to engaged by it due to director bad directing in the movie. The camerawork has big part of the movie being boring cause the director use the basic camera work back and back forth on the face when having the conversation between the character as opposed of thinking of new camera angel to get the audience engaged by the dialogue. The characters talking in the movie is like how someone talk in quiet place that has no energy and no personality which failed to engage when we watch it. If I want to watch that, I will listen to my parents in a conversation when we eating dinner which will be more entertaining. Also all characters have no personality, their just so egoistic an narcissistic that it's hard to root for them. The movie is just lifeless dull so I don't get why it's considered a masterpiece to cinema ."
9,I love it,"The Godfather is excellent Melo drama of crime film. About family, social, personal of our self about what should we do for protect the family and bring a punishment for bad people, and we also must teach a bad people with kindness not with violence."
10,You can only rate this a pure 10,"A perfect movie. Everything is well written and acting is on point. Even after so many years, it's still one of the best movies ever created and it will stay like that for a long time!"
10,wonderful,"The old generation of godfather's calm, calm, deep eyes, with a vague tone about the dignity of men, the words ""I will make him an offer he can't refuse"" let me have a deep respect for this role. Another mission depicts sonny, the elder son of the godfather of the older generation, who is hot-tempered and bent on revenge after his father is shot."
9,Brilliant,"I just watched the film and it was awesome, awesome word doesn't enough to describe this masterpiece. A film which truly captured my mind and also my thoughts, I just went berserk watching the film and I cant able to come out from the trance because every little detail in the film was totally went over the top and it made more beautiful and sharp, the one point we all should admit is that this piece needs to be released in 20's era, because everyone will have a scope to witness in big screen and ofcourse this is supposed to witness and enjoy on big screen, and cast and crew everyone did their best to bring this output."
9,Best Movie,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is not just a film-it's a cinematic landmark that redefined the gangster genre. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film masterfully weaves a compelling narrative of power, family, and loyalty, set against the backdrop of organized crime in post-war America.

Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone, portraying the aging yet formidable patriarch of the Corleone family with gravitas and depth. Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, the reluctant son who is slowly drawn into the ruthless world of the mafia, is one of the finest character arcs in film history. His transformation from an idealistic war hero to a cold, calculating leader is both haunting and mesmerizing.

Every aspect of The Godfather is meticulously crafted, from its brilliant screenplay and deeply layered characters to its breathtaking cinematography by Gordon Willis. Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly complements the film's atmosphere, making each scene even more powerful. Coppola's direction ensures that the film is more than just a crime story-it's a profound exploration of family, morality, and the cost of power.

With unforgettable dialogue, intense drama, and some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, The Godfather stands as a timeless masterpiece. Whether you're a first-time viewer or revisiting it for the hundredth time, its storytelling and performances remain just as compelling. A must-watch for any film enthusiast and a true testament to the art of filmmaking."
9,God Father,"The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. This timeless classic has left an indelible mark on the film industry, captivating audiences with its intricate storytelling, impeccable performances, and unforgettable characters. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary, while Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant heir to a ruthless mafia leader is a mesmerizing journey. The film's exquisite cinematography and haunting score further enhance its brilliance. ""The Godfather"" is not just a movie; it's an immersive experience that delves deep into the complex world of organized crime, making it an enduring gem in cinematic history."

9,This movies is my favorite,"Arguably the best motion picture ever made along with Godfather Part II. Brilliantly acted, sensational scripts, holds up with time. 9/10"
5,amazing,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions."
10,Masterpiece!,"This movie is definitely top 3 best movie ever made. It's a classic that will never run out of time.

A movie so intelligent and smart in every way. Showing the dark side of an organization like this but also I brotherly and family loving one.

Godfather movie 1 is great. And so is godfather 2. You need to see them both to understand the hole concept of it.

This classic movie has everything you want in a move. They don't make movies like this anymore and it's to bad.

The acting is phenomenal. The directing is great and the storyline and so interesting that you will not turn your head away for just a second."
8,Set the precedent...,"It's been a few years since I have seen this film, but it is definitely one of the all-time classics. I would give it a '10' but I find the length drags it down a little. Other than that deserving of belonging in the Top 250 films. However, I would not give it #1. I would have to reserver that honor for Sergio Leone's ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"". ""The Godfather"" did give us some awesome performances, one of the only Brando roles I truly enjoyed. As well my 2nd favorite Coppola film (1st being ""The Conversation"").I think it's worth repeat viewing, and a definite keeper in a movie lover's collection. Bottom line a solid '8', with a desire to see it again soon."
9,good movie,"The Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, close to a surface that is significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer that keeps the liquid from boiling rapidly. Because of this 'repulsive force', a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with the hot surface.

10,the best,Simply the best movie off all time.best acting by marlon brandon
7,good,"It wouldn't be possible not to watch a movie that is touted as a masterpiece that has attracted so much attention in the world, so that it starts about 10 times and ends with 10. I was the one who quit my movie in a minute, and then I didn't think there was anything wrong with me, but I started filming again last night with a calm head, and the movie is 15th. After a minute came the realization that you know I'm telling this because a lot of friends like me couldn't stand it and left, but I thought I should tell you in advance how many mistakes they made, my only criticism of the film is that it's very boring to enter directly into events without entering such a movie, presenting characters, but in the following minutes you can't even follow, subtly drawing you into the plot, involving you in costumes, and of course, with the quality of the actor, the drama thriller action romance, there's a lot that can be said about the film, drama thriller romance, costumes, and of course, it offers you a delicious movie, especially Marlon Brando the late officially blew, and then, of course, the great master al Pacino takes the reed in his hand and leaves the bomb on your lap for the continuation of the series, I strongly advise, be sure to watch it well..."
5,headline,How long does rewiev has to be to be long enoight?? I think this film is very overrated in my opinion... everyone has its own opinion so...
10,Very good,"Having watched the film only once maybe my opinion isn't the best but I really enjoyed it. Everything that you would expect from a classic New York gangsta film and all the characters fit their role perfectly. I love how Al Pacino slowly becomes more and more involved in the family and sometimes we have to do things we don't want to.

Just a classic film."
10,Best Movie ever created,"The AFI rated The Godfather the third best movie ever. Only citizen Kane and Casablanca were higher. I haven't seen citizen Kane, but I have seen Casablanca, and that can hold a very, very small candle to this masterpiece. In this movie nothing is gratuitous or useless. The dialouge is perfect. Even though this is a three hour movie, all the scenes still stick in my mind. Only great movies do that to you. If you see it, you'll see what I mean."
10,Most Powerful Movie Of ALL THE TIME !,"Amazing To Watch !

I have been late out but most of my time i enjoy to watch this movie."
10,NUMBER ONE,"It is the best film I have seen to date. It is flawless in every way, acting, story, cinematography, direction, etc. I have seen Citizen Kane, but I must say, this one beats it. I can wait until it comes out on DVD. You know when a film is great, that is when no matter how many times you have seen it, if you happen to catch it on TV, you still watch it and are glued to your TV set, this is that film."
10,Just WOW !,"**Review of The Godfather**

The Godfather is an absolute triumph in cinematic storytelling and remains a cornerstone of film history. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this masterpiece weaves a rich tapestry of family loyalty, power, and the complexities of the American Dream, all anchored by unforgettable characters and performances.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, capturing the nuances of a patriarch who balances ruthlessness with deep familial love. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael to a formidable force in the crime world is nothing short of mesmerizing. Each character is meticulously crafted, making the Corleone family both relatable and deeply compelling.

The film's cinematography is stunning, with its atmospheric lighting and meticulous attention to detail immersing viewers in the world of organized crime. Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly complements the narrative, enhancing the emotional depth and tension throughout.

What makes The Godfather truly remarkable is its exploration of morality and the consequences of choice. It invites viewers to reflect on the nature of power, loyalty, and sacrifice, leaving a lasting impression that resonates well beyond its runtime.

This film is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing exceptional writing, direction, and acting. It's a cinematic experience that demands to be seen and appreciated-truly a work of art that stands the test of time. If you haven't watched it yet, you're in for a profound journey into one of the greatest films ever made!"
9,A Timeless Masterpiece,"The Godfather, released in 1972, stands as an undisputed classic in the realm of cinema, a mesmerizing portrayal of power, family, and the dark underbelly of organized crime. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's acclaimed novel, this cinematic masterpiece continues to captivate audiences and remains a benchmark for storytelling excellence.

Set in the post-World War II era, The Godfather unfolds the story of the Corleone crime family, led by the enigmatic and iconic Vito Corleone, portrayed flawlessly by Marlon Brando. The film delicately balances the intricate dynamics of the Corleone family, interweaving themes of loyalty, honor, betrayal, and the price of power.

The Godfather showcases the masterful craftsmanship of Francis Ford Coppola, who skillfully crafts a narrative that pulls the audience into the gripping world of organized crime. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the characters to breathe and evolve, and the script, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is a work of art, filled with memorable lines that have become an indelible part of popular culture.

The film's cast is a tour de force of acting talent. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of mesmerizing, showcasing his ability to exude power and vulnerability simultaneously. Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone is a revelation, as he transforms from an innocent outsider to a ruthless leader consumed by his family's legacy. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, deliver exceptional performances that add depth and authenticity to the story.

Beyond its captivating performances, The Godfather is a visual feast. The cinematography, courtesy of Gordon Willis, paints a dark and brooding picture of a world where shadows hide secrets and violence lurks in the darkest corners. The film's iconic score by Nino Rota has become synonymous with the movie itself, elevating every scene and evoking a sense of both grandeur and impending doom.

What sets The Godfather apart from other crime dramas is its exploration of the themes of family and loyalty. Amidst the violence and corruption, the film delves into the moral complexities faced by its characters, questioning the extent to which they are willing to sacrifice their personal values for the sake of the family's survival.

The Godfather's influence on popular culture cannot be overstated. Its quotable lines, unforgettable characters, and powerful storytelling have left an indelible mark on cinema. Countless movies and TV shows have drawn inspiration from its narrative structure and iconic moments, but none have managed to replicate its magic."
10,The G.O.A.T.,"Movies don't get better than that and its been 50 years since that movie. The best production ever made. Marlon Brando and every single actor or actress playing in this movie are almost , if not perfect. The Godfather Part 2 & 3 are equally great and I wish movies today was just a tenth as good as these 3 movies!! Truly the greatest of all time. I could not possible pick a favorite scene because there are one too many iconic moments in this film. Of course if an offer I could not refuse was made to me... There would not be much I could do if you know what I mean. Al Pacino is still my favorite actor, the godfather movies are the reason!"
7,Amazing!,"I loved the plot,characters, everything about it was amazing. This movie is very iconic!"
1,i h8 this movie,"This is the worst movie ever. It is so over rated. One of the worst movies ever made. 3 Oscars? are you kidding me? more like 0 Oscars. why do people like this movie so much. i guess all critics and 91 percent of people are dumb. oh well, as i was saying, avoid this film at all costs. Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are the worst actors ever.

and it's so boring. i fell asleep half way through it. then i woke up. it was still going. i fell asleep again. i woke up again and it was still going! i know i already said this, bt the Godfather is the worst movie ever it was so bad that i'm just kidding. it's a classic. it's still over rated. but that's not saying much. 10/10."
10,"Bravo, This is a cinematic masterpiece","The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made and it is one of the few movies that doesn't have a single flaw in it. The direction in the Godfather is superb and he acting in the movie is excellent, Marlon Brando gives us one of his best performances. Frances Ford Coppola makes the movie focus more on the family than on anything else and is much more than a gangster movie, it is more about family. The Movie is a film noir perfect in every way. 10 OUT OF 10."
10,A Masterpiece of Cinema Fifty years young =),"I won't go into an in depth review of all the characters and plot lines etc. I'll keep it simple with just my immediate thoughts.

Spanning ten years from '45 through to '55 in post war America/Italy, The Godfather is a stunning masterpiece crime drama film and it's easy to see why it has cemented itself in the hearts of film buffs both young and old.

The centralization of the film is the Corleone family members and Coppola's direction is razor sharp. The entire film is masterfully shot from start to finish, death scenes are hard hitting and very impactful but never overdone. Acting and dialogue is superb from everybody. Brando's lines are a little hard to understand at times but he perfectly captures the image of an ageing Mafia boss.

Clocking in at almost three hours, it's a slow paced film but very engaging throughout. I enjoyed it so much it didn't feel like it was that long of a film. It feels like two hours, not three.

The 4K restoration makes this movie look truly fantastic. It looks like it's a movie made in the early 90's not the early 70's. I picked up the 50th anniversary box set in 4K and can't wait to watch Part 2 and Coda (Part 3). So great to have the full set of these three legendary films on the best format available."
10,"A stellar cast for a timeless, brilliant and spectacular classic film","A stellar cast for a timeless, brilliant and spectacular classic film. A milestone set in the history of cinema by three big names: Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The best Mob film ever made, pioneering in many aspects: camera movements and shots, poetry of light, actor's work in pauses full of meaning and tension. The work of production designer Dean Tavoularis and costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone were very meticulous and truthful and created that impact of truthfulness that served as an indispensable support in the unraveling of the intertwining of a terrible and shocking but tender at the same time story, always exciting. A film that gives you something more at every new vision."
10,The Best,Cant say anything. Phenomenal performanes. One of the best soundtracks ever. Directing is unbelievable. Characterization is extraordinary....
10,The Critically Tripled's view....,"The top ranked movie on Critically Tripled's Top 200 Movies of all time! If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must be living in a box. The DVD set is truly amazing a must own! If you want to see more of Critically Tripled and who else is on the Top 200 Movies and many other options please respond to this review to me via e-mail or via post! And if you don't, it's ok, because if I wanted you dead, I would have killed you already."
10,"After the success of a new Top Gun movie and a new American Gigolo show, Paramount should think of a new Godfather movie or show!","Is it even possible to still contribute something to the many glorious reviews that are already available?! I just do not know... This movie is perfect in so many aspects that it is ridiculous to say anything other than what everyone is already saying.

But wait... Maybe I can still contribute something! I personally loved the amazing performance of Marlon Brando in the role of Vito Corleone, a godfather in his 70's or 80's. To even realize that Marlon Brando was as old as I currently am, just makes me appreciate what a difficult task he was faced with.

The cool thing that I learnt is that the dentist of Marlon Brando even had a special mouthpiece made that brought his chin forward. Together with the very recognizable voice of Vito Corleone, it is this combination that contributes to making this movie iconic. Who hasn't ever tried to mimic the voice of the godfather?!

This 50-year old movie still stands at the top of the list of ""best movies ever made"". And rightfully so! I have watched this movie already several times in my life, and each time I enjoyed watching it.

And of course it isn't too surprising that I give this movie a 10-star rating. Anything less than a perfect score would be an insult!

It is remarkable that after 50 years - I write this in 2022 - Paramount still hasn't decided to make other movies that fit the ""Godfather""-franchise. I can think only of the 3 movies that were released. But who knows... Seeing that Paramount just released a show based on the 1980's movie ""American Gigolo"" and another movie based on ""Top Gun"" makes me think that we may possibly see another Godfather show or movie! The question will then be how close it can come to the quality of the original Godfather trilogy."
10,Unique,Among One of the best gangster movies And the characters are never forgotten by us
1,Eh,I have nothing against this movie honestly... i could just never get into it long enough to stay awake.
9,Its good,Really good. I liked it. beings a biy slow but it works.
10,"If saw this, and thought that isn't good, see it again, cause you saw wrong.","The first time I had seen ""The Goofather"" I thought that was just ""ok"" and ""good"", I think that my main issue was that the movie was ""too long"". Well, I passed the last 5 years thinking: ""Man, we saw that movie in the wrong way, this isn't possible"". And, yes, I was wrong, and yes, I had seen it wrong.

The thing here is, I saw the movie a couple of days now, and I can't thing in a bad thing about it. Really, that isn't one think that seems misplaced or something. The script is fantastic, the movie had a lot time jumps, but you don't get confused, the actors are great (Marlon Brando and Al Pacino mainly), the photography is beautiful, and a lot other things.

Well, I really think that isn't much to say here, there wasn't said yet. The Godfather is a real masterpiece."
10,Best,"One of the best movies ever. If you haven't watched it, definitely watch it. I have never seen such a movie in my life. The actors are great, the story is very good. He dealt with the dirty order in the world. The lead is awesome! All the scenes impressed me a lot. I think this is the best of the whole series. The talented team and behind the scenes team did a really good job. I continue to recommend this movie to everyone around me. I watch it again and again in my spare time. He dealt with the dirty order in the world. The lead is awesome! All the scenes impressed me a lot. I think this is the best of the whole series."
10,Perfect,I can only recommend it because it is a masterpiece.
9,It's the kind of movie that happens every 100 years. Absolutely perfect.,"You simply cannot leave this world without watching this absolute masterpiece. No spoilers will be given here, i will just tell that you MUST watch it! From the soundtrack to the way the scenes are shot. All The sequences in the film planned to the detail so you can have a sensation of fluidity within almost 3 hours of pure epicness. All the details about the mafia underworld are there. Also, the detail and importance of all characters who appear in the screen is superb, leaving no one without importance or purpose. Also, the casting of Marlon Brando and pretty much everyone was just perfect, as the future would prove few years later. If you do not enjoy this movie, you wont enjoy any other."
10,Best movie ever,"Best movie ever, I love it so much! I enjoy every moment, every second"
10,Good one,"With several million hardcover and paperback books acting as trailers, Paramount's film version of Mario Puzo's sprawling gangland novel, ""The Godfather,"" has a large pre-sold audience. This will bolster the potential for the film which has an outstanding performance by Al Pacino and a strong characterization by Marlon Brando in title role. It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as to be superior screen drama. This should not mar Paramount's b.o. expectations in any measure, though some filmgoers may be disappointed."
5,Maybe I don't get it,"This film acurately depicted scenes from the book very well, and the acting is good. That said, not all books cross to film well. This is one such instance, in my opinion. Beyond the faithful recreations of some classic scenes, I don't see what there is to like. I'm sure some people say they just like it because it's popular."
10,Classic,"Classic movie with classic actors in which it cannot be missed. A movie that I grew up with and your children and grandchildren will as well. Not many movies are made in this way. Some try to replicate, but it cannot be done. A timeless classic that does not go out of style. A movie that may not be for the whole family, but eventually will."
10,one of the best.,"Francis Ford Coppola's *The Godfather* (1972) is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the gangster genre. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone anchor the film's powerful narrative. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, intricately weaves themes of power, family, and loyalty. Gordon Willis's cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score add depth, making the film an immersive experience. *The Godfather* remains a timeless exploration of human nature and the American Dream.

In short words... one of the best films ever, MUST WATCH."
10,Simply The BEST,"It's the one of the greatest movies ever , it deserves a 11 not 10 for there is no movie can compete with it"
9,Quite Possibly the greatest film ever made,"The Godfather earns its status as a landmark in cinema. Coppola outdoes himself in his direction, and the performance of Marlon Brando as the titular character may be the most iconic role in film history. Sporting a great story, lots of suspense and a perfect ending, The Godfather is a must see for anybody."
10,Think.,Good. Combat is a good thing. Only the strong must survive When there's war there's game.
10,"Brilliant, the best film EVER, brilliant","I have only seen THE GODFATHER twice but is already one of my favorite films ever. Some of the ideas in this film are very, very creative. Espcially the part where Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) goes to the Italian resturaunt to kill the two men, but he knows they will search him. So he gets one of his friends to hide one in a bathroom stall. Isn't that brilliant. The performances are excellent. James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino. All great. What I don't get is why Marlon Brando agreed to portray in this film, but claimed his one of the worst experiences of his life. I think they could have chose someone a bit better for the role of Vito Corleone. Other than that, this movie is awesome. Everyone should see this. 175 minutes of family, action, drama, and murder. Why else would it be the #1 film on the Top 250 Films of All Time list."
7,Not a masterpiece,"This movie is one of the most famous in the history of cinema, but I can't see the reasons. It's true that Marlon Brando plays like a god and that Al Pacino begins to show why he is one of the best living actors... but there are too many dialogues that choke the breath of the movie. There are also some ""holes"" in the screenplay: for instance, why do we see one of the Godfather's sons (Al Pacino) first like a shy guy and then like a determined and blood-thirsty beast? Only because they killed his sicilian wife that he forgets soon to marry another girl? The direction of Coppola is flat: I don't like the way he just throws away the ""crescendo"" of some thrilling scenes and the way he doesn't emphasized the story. Besides after some killings we get to know their ways, so the last killings are ""phoned""... we exactly know what is going to happen and so the surprise goes wasted. Only in the final Coppola succeeds in finding a beautiful alternated editing where he shows the deep contradictions of the members of the Mafia: Michael Corleone is in a Church where he swears to renounce the Devil and in the meanwhile his men are making a massacre. So: a good film but not a masterpiece as many people think."
10,Greatest movie of all time,"What more can be said that already has on this utter masterpiece of a movie. Along with part 2, these are my favourite films of all time and I personally don't think there will ever be a movie that will surpass these stunning pieces of work. Let's start with part 1, The Godfather. An outstanding achievement in American cinema following Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, Francis F Coppola directs and achieved such a stunning piece of work, it's pretty much as close to perfection as a movie can get. It follows the story of an Italian American crime family, and is based on the real life Five families of New York City during this era, but is superbly paced and developed in such stunning fashion, you literally feel you are there with them in the screen. The character development is outstanding and we grow to love these characters like they are own family. The cinematography world class and still hasn't been beaten to this day. Who can ever forget the beautiful brown contrast colours that dominate when you are engrossed in this piece of art. The music without saying is up there amongst the finest piece in movie history. It's a film that still holds up, despite it being made nearly 50 years ago. It put actors like Al Pacino on the map to true stardom. If you haven't seen the Godfather then you clearly don't appreciate good movies. The greatest film of all time."
9,perfect,"What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word ""cinema"". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes.

Although this film has a three-act structure, all the acts are well packed with content. And so the film is watched in one breath. And most importantly, what message ... Each person has the right to decide for himself what meaning was laid down by the author."
10,incredile,"I was roughly twenty years away from even being conceived when The Godfather came out. Growing up as a film nut, I often heard of The Godfather as possessing a sort of mythic status that few films made after 1955 possess. I first watched it back close to ten years ago as a 12-year-old, never fully getting the story with the film falling into the ""great film that I didn't appreciate"" category until a month or so back when I got the Coppola restoration Blu-Ray and realized as an adult how fantastic of a film it truly was. The Godfather works so well because it isn't a film that kisses its ass on a variety of sub-levels. Francis Ford Coppola went out of his way not to make the film one that glorifies the Mafia in any way but still realized what a magnificent project it was. It begins in celebration and ends as the first part of the trilogy in bitter-sweet victory and tragedy for the Corleones with Michael having slowly morphed into a different character by the end and the Corleone family itself has endured tragedy after tragedy. Depending on if you're selective to certain genres of movies -- particularly crime and heist thrillers -- the 1970s were either a fantastic time with the New Hollywood group of directors or a pitiful time where the Anti-Hero was all the rage. I've always tried to keep a foot in both camps for the most part, but if a film like this doesn't make you at least sit there as the credits roll, musing in thought like Indiana Jones after being given a clue by a recently-killed shaman or anti-Nazi spy the first time you watch it, then I'm not sure you know how to appreciate films and movies as art and not just entertainment. There are so many ways this film just works so well; the first is that Coppola always had a way of making the cinematography and direction style look both extravagant, but also bleak at the same time, partially through sun-faded cinematography (I'm just guessing) and also partially through the way the film itself was shot. As well fact that Coppola spared nothing when it came to deploying talented screen stars of the day to cast The Godfather, leading Marlon Brando to find international success once more with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as the reluctant, but the eventual successor to his father Vito, Michael Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and of course, a pre-Rocky Talia Shire as Connie Corleone. These cast members in particular stand out in their performances and convey a sort of detached emotion that makes the film so great (if you need clarification on this, the scene where Vito overlooks his own son's body in the morgue is a prime example). Although it is the best install installment Godfather trilogy, the film itself suffers from a few key points that I've never been able to reason out why were included. Specifically, the whole sequence involves Johnny Fontaine and the Woltz horse fiasco which has no real involvement in the over-arcing storyline. However, with how spectacular of a film it is, I'm not going to sit here and complain about it any further."
10,This movie and other 2 parts are amazing!,"I have watched all 3 parts of this series, all are amazing. I don't think i can watch any other movie(s) like that."
9,Words cannot express my feelings,"Within three hours, the group portrait is complete, and the characters are evenly shaded, and there are no idle strokes. Many scenes can be called great. The environment, sound, lighting, and props are integrated. For example, when the hospital changes rooms, the editing is too good and busy. He never forgets the tears around the godfather 's eyes, which is suitable for movement; for example, the clip of baptism and killing is a thrilling one. The second generation of the godfather gradually sublimates and freezes in the intersection of joy and cold blood."
7,The Godfather,"A good movie is never responsible for setting up three views, but only expressing it, and then leaving the rest to the audience to choose."
2,"Immersive, but as much about the 1950's as 'Happy Days'","1. Haircuts completely wrong in that 1970's manner. James Caan, for example.

2. Clothes ditto.

3. Nothing personal, but Brando was a ham.

4. Al Pacino simply does not have the physical presence, at least not then. In the 'gangster' suits and hats he looks ridiculous, not important or scary.

5. Extravagant son-et-lumieres do not an epic make.

6. For its time, The Godfather was a refreshing change from the regular fare of 1972 with some good catchphrases, that's all.

7. Greater than the sum of its parts because it's lush, visually and musically; but actually there's not much holding the set pieces together."
10,**** (Out of four),"""The Godfather"" is one of the crossroads one must cross before proclaiming oneself a movie fan and a genuine movie buff. Francis Ford Coppola's film is probably his most flawless, although it is NOT my favorite Coppola film (that honor belongs to the unmistakably problematic but highly visionary ""Apocalypse Now""). Still, in the midst of a 90s cinema which seems to re-evalutate itself every five years or so with new computer-generated images and thusly cannot enjoy the same degree of timelessness of several earlier, better movies, ""The Godfather"" will undoubtedly hold its own as one of the most artistic endeavors in the relatively new medium of cinema.

The story has been told many times before: based on Mario Puzo's bestseller, the film examines the aura of the Italian Mafiosi as exemplified through the Corleone family, led by patriarch Vito (Marlon Brando, an Oscar winner in a very professional bit of acting). WWII-hero Michael (Al Pacino--the real star of the film as well as the real Best Actor of that year) comes home and breaks family tradition at his sister Connie's wedding ceremony not only by wearing his military uniform, but introducing his family to his WASP-ish girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), the epitome of modernistic feminine and Protestant intentions in the Corleone's traditional Catholic--and increasingly outdated--worldview. The wedding scene is one of the great expositions of cinema, and yet the film lives up to all expectations by dashing us headlong into the Corleone's violent world. Of course who can forget the severed horse head in the mansion of the luxurious Hollywood producer, the murder of Luca Brasi, ""sleeping with the fishes"", Santino's bloody murder at the toll booth, Brando's death scene, the intercutting between the baptism and the murders, and especially the final scene as the door closes and Kay realizes the deceit her entire life will become? To launch into a detailed discussion of Coppola's masterly filmmaking would take beyond 1000 words, so let me just echo the comments of many when saying ""The Godfather"" is that priceless canoli one should always cherish amidst the decaying corpses of escalating Hollywood trash."
9,Great Movie!,"Acting was amazing, what else could you say. Watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall was so impressive."
10,pure genius,"`The Godfather' is quite possibly one of the best movies made in history. This film has been quoted/mimicked time and time again, even in a Rugrats (the famous children's cartoon) episode. Why would this movie be quoted so much if it wasn't so amazing? It wouldn't be. All the hype made about this movie really isn't understood until you actually watch the film. It's a classic that can't be described.

I suppose it's illustriousness could be arguable either way, but most viewers find this movie riveting and engaging. One could understand how someone could find this movie dry, especially in the beginning. If you're not familiar with the plot at all, many things could be missed the first time around. It starts out at his daughters wedding, and from there, all the events can easily run together and cause a vast amount of confusion within the viewer. If you stick to it, promises are that the movie does get betterimmensely.

There isn't one single thing that makes this movie so remarkable. It could be that it had a spectacular cast, intriguing plot, and very realistic situations. Or, it could be that this movie has what any great story has, a huge change in the main character. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is by far one of the most interesting characters through the movie. You watch every step of his moves, thoughts, actions and you see him evolve into the person his father tried so hard to keep him away from. The actual scene where he makes his huge jump could be argued, but it is often believed that this change took place at the hospital. This was his first opportunity to take charge of the `family business.'

Many details, sentences, phrases could go into this review to describe the movie. But, words could never really fill all of the emotions that you experience during this film. Out of all the classic films I've seen, this is by far the most captivating I've experienced. This film isn't recommended for smaller children, one because they wouldn't be able to comprehend as well as early adults would, and two, because there are some things that may be found offensive to a younger crowd. All in all, this movie receives a 10/10 stars for pure genius."
10,Godfather,Mohsen.r06 instagram godfather for all people al pacino is wonderful.
7,very good movie,I loved this movie a lot and i watched it more than once
1,Not as great as everyone thinks,"I found this movie to be disappointing in terms of story, narrative and authenticity."
10,The GodMovie,"The Godfather it is an adaptation of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, taking as its main theme the Mafia Italian. The story portrays the ""family"" of mobsters Italo-American in the city of New York, known for Corleone surname, being Vito Andolini Corleone (Marlon Brando) their patriarch and the head of the family.

In his excellent acting, Marlon Brando, in fact devoted his career as an actor and had the best actor Oscar. And it was not only him, Al Pacino really showed the brilliant actor he is, and showed his performance to the world. The film grossed an estimated US $245,066,411, winning 3 Oscars: Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, Best Actor in a Leading Role and the last Best Picture. And among many other awards.

The Godfather portrays the life of the Corleone family, who lived and ran New York, there are also other 4 families beyond this that commanded their respective areas, so one could not intervene on the other. Between business and crime, there the loyalty and mutual respect between family members and with the other, as these were the main slogans of the Mafia. Once they became members family, would be treated with respect and loyalty, if there were treachery or disrespect or conflict of ideals with another member or family, this or the whole family would pay with his own life, as happens in many cases portrayed in the film."
9,A must-see for any movie lover!,"The Godfather (1972) is an intricate yet compelling story about the Corleone family who is involved with the Italian mafia in New York in the 1940's. This movie shows the revenge, greed, and betrayal, between the Corleones and the mafia. Marlon Brando does a superb job playing the godfather who is the leader of the mafia, or Vito as they call him. His character gives one insight to what the mafia really is about and the business deals among them. Other actors such as Al Pacino and James Caan also portray their characters Michael and Sonny as the sons of the godfather very well too. Michael at the beginning of the movie has no interest in being involved in the mafia and by the end he has taken over the family business. People get to see first hand the transformation of these characters from beginning to the end of the movie. The story line makes this movie much more fascinating yet harder to follow than your average movie. Each scene that takes place in the movie is essential to understanding and delving in even deeper into the history of the Corleones and their involvement with the mafia. The great acting, excellent dialogue, and an ever-changing plot is what sets this movie apart from the rest. I recommend this movie to any movie fanatic. The Godfather is more aimed towards older teens and adults because of the complicated storyline and the violence shown."
10,The best movie of all times,"Should be nr.1 movie.

Its the best movie of all times I used to watch it when I was a little kid and I still watch it sometimes.

Great story.

The film is perfect and only people who dont understand would't watch it.

Gangsta movies are always a choice. Lol."
10,My review,"This is my favourite film. And after seeing al pacino 's acting i will definitely watch scarface too and the characters of this Godfather series was too good. I have seen that this this is on 2nd highest rating movie so i am here to give more rating to this masterpiece so i can help this to be on 1st highest rated movie on imdb.

Thank you."
10,One of the all time greatest and a unforgettable masterpiece.,"The Godfather was in 1973 a masterpiece and it still is and always will be. This movie is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made.

The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 45 years after its release. This movie has become a huge part of popular culture. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory. I can watch it over and over again with great pleasure...."
10,"The Godfather is a masterpiece that will hold up for many years, brilliant storytelling and a true classic","The Godfather is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo and it's based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. Why is this film regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? It's an three hour ride of cinema of some of the finest written, finest acted, finest cinematography, finest editing, the remarkable musical score by Nino Rota and of course the brilliance that is Francis Ford Coppola. He created a masterpiece but bear in mind, though it is a movie everyone should watch, the slow pace and long length might turn some people off but if you bear with the slow pace then you will absolutely love the film. For being released in 1972 it was a very violent film. It's also full of symbolism which makes a second or third viewing so much more fun as there's so many details the director placed into its many scenes.

The Godfather is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. Spanning from 1945 to 1955, it chronicles the Corleone Crime Family under patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss. There's a huge cast playing these well written characters, also some big names who're playing them. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Richard Castellano as Peter Clemenza: a caporegime in the Corleone crime family, Sonny's godfather, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen: consigliere, lawyer and unofficial adopted member of the Corleone family, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams: Michael's girlfriend and, later, second wife, Richard Conte as Emilio ""The Wolf"" Barzini: a crime boss of a rival crime family, Al Lettieri as Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo: an adversary who pressures Vito to get into the drug business, backed by the Tattaglia family. As you see, there are a lot of characters and everyone is extremely well written and some even based on real people. The whole portrayal of the mafia is extremely well done and I'm glad they did the research. Each character has a meaning to the story and there's some terrific performances in each scene you watch. Thanks to Coppola's request approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs, using over 120 distinct locations. The remaining portions were filmed in California, or on-site in Sicily. Shooting on authentic locations made everything so much more realistic and immersive, Francis Ford Coppola used that to tell the story he wanted to tell, and I think it helped a lot for the actors and look for the film.

Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is truly and I mean this, among the best performances I have ever seen in my life, I didn't really find it to be the best on my first viewing but now... Just wow. He deserved that Oscar, without a doubt. Al Pacino is also great, truly terrific but in comparison to his performance in The Godfather Part 2, it's not as great as it's literally hard to top that. Though Brando and Pacino deliver some of cinema's best performances, there are still a lot of others who does some impressive acting performances, one of them being Robert Duvall who are among my favorite actors. Along with Marlon Brando, he and Duvall wear some serious make-up and prosthetics that make them almost unrecognizable. Everyone in the cast does a great job with showing emotion through the use of the facial expressions and I love that, I can't name everyone but it's an incredible ensemble cast.

The film won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director. Since its release, The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. I'll agree fully with that as after rewatching this film for the second time I can only say how beautifully and brilliantly told it is, highest quality of storytelling and visual storytelling. The first time I watched it was in 2015 I believe and I loved it then, and absolute liked it a lot more the second time, it's a mesmerizing and literally breathtaking 3 hours."
6,Don't Like Violence,"I really don't understand, and don't want to understand, why people are obsessed with this type of movie. Every violent scene makes me sick, and I don't want to go back to any of them. I even think that to treat such a film as a classic, even if it is highly skilled, isn't it secretly instigating more people to worship violence? Damn manly. It amounts to violence in some ways."
1,Under Duress,"First saw this film back in Sydney in the early seventies. Had a certain kudos then as it was a groundbreaking film of its sort. Or so the story goes! Watched it on BBC i player as there was nothing else at all in the film catalogue. Main observations after all these decades. In the signature and most memorable moment in the whole 3 hours plus (snooze), I would love to know how the mafia goon managed to get the enormous horses head in the bed without the director in it waking up. Apologies if IMDb have already noted this ludicrous goof in the list of goofs. It was a completely lame scene if you will forgive the pun Marlon Brando seems to be having trouble with vocal clarity and was slurring his way throughout the film. Maybe hitting the Sicilian wine a little hard? All in all, including the mammoth length of the movie, no satisfactory end. Of course it was groundbreaking possibly for this reason and this reason alone. They were laying the foundation for a franchise of Godfathers. Something the film industry in the twentieth first century have taken to the max."
8,Drab and awful?,"Derirative, contrived, moronic in parts, inexcusably slapstick, horrendously acted, monstrously ill-informed, soul-wastingly aimless, incompetantly structured, amazingly awful dialogue, virulently hideous casting, monstrous over use of toilet humour, inescapably stupid bodily function gags, insanely complicated plot, innumerable plot-holes, a myriad of anachronisms, baffling directorial ineptitude, spectacularly pretentious and alienating, superbly bad costumes, terrible make-up, manically dire soundtrack...

...are all NOT faults of this quite splendid gangster epic. Liked it quite a lot."
10,best movie,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece."
8,Really good! A Iconic classic!,"Ive heard and read so many times that ""The Godfather"" is a must-watch classic, with a very large impact and reputation. And a very high rating on imdb. Aswell as it is one of the best films ever made. So i finally was able to give it a well deserved watch.

Starts out pretty good and gives that iconic first impression and the famous atmosphere you heard about.

And it manages to keep that all the way to the end.

Marlon Brando truly does a iconic, world class level, performance! Almost all of the actors does really good performances!

Soundtrack is really really good!

Cinematography and filimg is extremely impressive and well made! Extremely well directed!

Manuscript is truly amazing!

A movie you have to watch! I really recommend it! Really good! A Iconic classic!

However, Its not the best film ive seen. Atlest 20 films beat this one, in case of how good it is. But its still a very great film!"
10,Awesome movie,"Love it. I enjoy this film and live the cast. Is amazing and wonderful find movies like this one. A lot of Action, and suspense. This was the first time and I really enjoy it. I will tell close friends. Highly recommended. So excited. Im not sure if they will be doing another movie like this one. But that will be great for us."
9,Great Movie,The Godfather is an evergreen movie that can be watched anywhere and anytime.
7,Don't hang me up just yet,"Ok so the godfather is THAT movie that is a must watch if you tell anybody who's into movies that you're also into movies. If you say you haven't seen it they will tell you to go and watch it. That's what happened to me.

Why did I give it a 7/10? It was just long and at times felt boring and just unrealistic. But that's just me, 7 was my level of enjoyment, because it did keep my attention the entire movie, I mean I was really paying attention trying to pick up on all of its masterfulness but it was just a long movie for me. Not special at all. For me.

The casting, music, cinematography, dialogue, pacing, everything was very solid but to me I just didn't enjoy as much as people said I would."
1,"Appalling RUBBISH,","Brando was about the only semi decent thing in this (mainly because he was hardly in it, and i like Brando) overlong poorly edited piece of garbage. First things first the movie looks like crap Gordon Willis' Cinematograpthy is absolutely appalling, the editing is just bizarre it looks like it was made by a film maker trying to simulate tension or sadness and tragedy but had no ideas how to use the tools an experienced director would have used, the music made me want to smash my brains in and James Caan as an Italian American gangster was just ridiculous it would be like getting Danny glover to play Maculay Culkins character in home alone, but then again as someone who has seen a lot of the movies produced by Coppola like Peggy sue got married, tucker the man and his dream, the cotton club, Finnians rainbow, the rainmaker and many more poorly filmed dated badly written pieces of forgettable rubbish I should have expected the godfather to be as appalling as i found it, but as everyone who has ever seen the godfather who happens to be a film buff and not just a normal guy in the street who will watch the occasional movie they tend to drool over this muddy looking scrappy overlong bore fest. All in all I would say this movie should probably be destroyed so morons can't talk about how it is the holy grail of all movies ever made."
8,I agree,"Stereotypes have got to start somewhere. This is the birth of the modern gangster movie, so I'd expect the character types to be emulated by later films in the genre."
10,Best movie ever !,"When I was little a didn't like it a lot...But after several years I watched it again and WoW ! From the beginning to the end it so interesting.Yeah I know it is old but this movie is so good that I doubt that soon we will see something as good as this.I watched it more than 20 times and every time I watched it with the same interest.The script was wrote so good but after its combined with actors its just perfect.I read and the book but we have to agree that this is the first time when the movie is better than the book.Why? Easy - when we read we have all in our head but here we see something which is better.There are a lot of good actors which did this. And Marlon Brando - speechless. This role was perfect played and it was perfect for him.Here just a perfect movie which is mixed of one time script , actors and unique soundtrack."
10,The film that made us all an offer we couldn't refuse,"If there's one film for which the phrase ""best ever made"" seems like a massive understatement, it's The Godfather. This film is pretty much as close to cinematic perfection as you can possibly get. From the very first moments, with its beautiful theme playing on trumpets, it hooks you and doesn't let go for the next three hours. The opening is possibly the best I've ever seen: the first thirty minutes does an incredible job of establishing the setting, characters, and plot points, major and minor, all through dialogue and interactions. From there, it's a roller coaster of exceptional storytelling and character development that's endlessly captivating. And at its heart is the story of one man's rise to power coupled with the start of his fall from grace. Michael starts out as an honest man who wants nothing to do with the family business. But, as their enemies move in on them, he gets roped into that world in the worst way. After seeing the ugliness therein, he makes plans to make the family legitimate, but starts to go too far in his methods of doing so, starting a downward spiral that only gets worse as the series progresses. It's a brilliant character arc that I could probably talk for hours about.

It's astonishing to think that Marlon Brando had to fight to be allowed to even be in this movie, because he was truly born for it. He doesn't just play Vito Corleone, he is Vito Corleone, giving him a humble, gentle, yet subtly threatening performance that's easily one of, if not the best, acting job I have ever seen. Al Pacino, a personal favorite, excels as Michael, perfectly showcasing his growth as a character. The later scenes in particular are where he truly shines; all he needs to do is flash that signature glare of his and you know there's trouble waiting. James Caan really should have won the Oscar for his incredible performance. And the rest of the cast is fantastic too. What really makes the performances work, at least in regards of the actors who play the Corleones, is that they truly feel like a genuine family, in more ways than one.

From the opening pan out of the old man telling the Don his story to the final shot of Diane Keaton's disturbed look at what her husband's become, Francis Ford Coppola's direction is absolutely incredible. Every scene, every shot, every edit instantly grabs your attention and leaves you wondering what will happen next. The film is chock full of memorable moments, catchy music, and endlessly quotable dialogue. And it all leads up to a scene that still gives me chills every time I watch this film: the baptism scene. The music, the editing, the buildup and payoff, and the juxtaposition of this sacred ritual against all the horrors being committed at the same time make for a scene that's absolutely flawless and easily a top ten favorite. For the record, I actually got to see this film in theaters a couple of years ago for its fiftieth anniversary, and it was beyond worth the price of admission.

Overall, I think I've more than said all I needed to say about The Godfather. It's without a doubt one of my all time favorite movies, well deserving of its legendary status and I truly can't recommend it enough."
10,nice,Nice. The best In the world The greatest series you will ever watch .
10,Believe the hype.,"I remember when I was about 13 when I first watched the Godfather. I turned it off after half an hour. Three years later one of my friends had it on video. At first I was reluctant to watch it, but I became entranced by what I saw. Not only did it contain probably the best ensemble cast I have ever seen(Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Shire), but it is also one of the greatest stories in modern cinema. The predominant theme in this film is not violence or power as some might say it is, but family. Without giving the film away, the most moving and evocative parts of the film are when the members of the family are involved. I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Brando's work (Apart from 'Apocalypse Now'), but he deserved an Oscar here, for one of the greatest performances of our time. Caan, as the explosive 'Sonny' should have got 'Best Supporting Actor' too, as well as other magnificent performances by Pacino as Michael, and Duvall as Tom. Watch this film, you will NOT be disappointed. The greatest film ever? Probably-a definite 10."
7,The Story of The MOB,"One of the original gangster movies that can never be duplicated.

The Godfather chronicles a family from poverty to the highest rank in American society. A family enriched in culture, honor, pride and retaliation.

I watched this tribology in my youth, i never knew that the Godfather is loosely based around the lifestyles and chronicles of real crime families. It should fall into the category of documentary because no one writer can imagine and develop a screenplay that would soon become an American mainstay in film and popular culture. The Godfather is a must see for all young film makers and scriptwriters that is attempting to recreate a story of a family in the underworld."
2,"Oink, oink","Another piece of purest cured ham from the Porkfather. Brando is probably history's most overrated artist in any field.

""Mzumble grzblble grnf argle graarg"" (falls over with long, loud fart and begins to eat bits of old cheeseburger)

""Yes thank you Marlon, but I'm note sure Shakespeare put the emphasis on the second syllable."""
10,An all-time classic!,"There are simply no words to express how great this film truly is! How can one still watch this film made in 1972 today?

Very few films are able to achieve what the Godfather did, most aspiring actors look up to this movie as an inspiration and attempt to do what each actor was able to do in this film.

The movie is simply timeless and a huge reason why Al Pacino became a huge star. It is almost impossible to find any shortcomings in the film as all the performances were extremely organic and rarely felt scripted.

Last but certainly not the least, thank you to Marlon Brando, who did not just give us one of the most iconic movie posters of all-time but also hooked you to the screen whenever he came on and embodied the role of an aged mafia don with the utmost conviction.

A masterpiece of cinema, this."
8,what a film 🎥 👏,I enjoyed every second in this film it was so amazing and i can't belive that this film was filmed at 1972 absolutely wow the story was amazing of Careyoli family and all the story about mafias
10,Excellence,"The Godfather—Masterpiece. Watched this movie the other day and was surprised how good it is. Quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. This is what happens when you have excellent writing, superb directing, great acting, and the right sound track.

This is a story about family, set to the backdrop of the Mafia. More than anything else, it is about the ascension of Michael Corleone, from WWII hero into the ruthless world of organized crime. Brando was certainly deserving of his Oscar, but Al and Francis should have won one as well.

It's the only movie I've seen where every scene matters and every scene is memorable. Probably too violent for some, but is definitely on my list of 10 movies everyone should see.

Way to go Francis!"

10,Why this is a great movie,"1. The acting. Every performance in this film is believable. You forget they are acting and really believe they are the characters. 2. The pace. Not too slow, not too fast, just right. 3. The music. Perfect! 4. Character introduction, character development. All the major characters are introduced in a way, and then you see how they change. 5. The details, sounds, etc. You really get the sense of the decade they are in. The phones, cars, restaurants etc all feel authentic. 6. There is a love story, but too mushy, and it does not detract from the film. 7. There is some comedy, but in small subtle doses, and does not take away the serious of the film. 8. Suspense and surprises. 9. the most memorable opening scene of all time, arguably. 10. The impact on pop culture. Scenes, lines, etc. That are now part of our every day vocabulary."
10,The Best,"It's hard to say what they could've done better. Much like Titanic, everyone fits their role like they were born for it. It ages well and pays a hefty price, and it's smooth and has legs. Like any fine wine, this classic will be put on the topmost shelf of the cellar."
10,sajdv ascbkjv askjbc,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

7,nice movie,"The Godfather, the first film in the franchise, was released on March 15, 1972. The feature-length film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based upon Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. The plot begins with Don Vito Corleone declining an offer to join in the narcotics business with notorious drug lord Virgil Sollozzo, which leads to an assassination attempt. Meanwhile, Vito's oldest son Sonny takes over the family and Michael strikes back for the assassination attempt by killing Sollozzo and a corrupted police captain, forcing Michael to go to Sicily in hiding. While in Sicily, Michael travels around the country and meets a young woman whom he marries, but who is eventually killed in a car bombing. Michael returns to America after the news of his brother Sonny's murder. After returning, Vito turns over the reins of the family to Michael. Michael plans to move the family business to Las Vegas; but before the move, he plots the killing of the heads of the five families on the day of his nephew's baptism. Other subplots include Vito's daughter's abusive marriage, Johnny Fontaine's success in Hollywood, and Vito's second oldest son Fredo's role in the family business in Las Vegas."
4,"Good, but not THAT good","This is a good movie but not as great as everyone seems to think.

Certaintly not the number one movie in the top 250. Heat, in fact,

was much better than The Godfather. Pachino's acting was not so

very good and the plot was slightly sluggish. The whole time

where Pachino is 'away' is a blind alley of a plot line and only

serves to kill off his first wife that has no bearing on the plot really.

7/10"
10,The Godfather,"I saw this movie when i was studying in a university, reaaly this is so impressive , that a child reached in USA and became the head of mafia and criminal, he prove him self as a godfather he was involve in every field of life especially politics."
10,Masterpiece,"The Godfather Trilogy, is a masterpiece of international cinematography!"
10,"A great analysis on culture, family, traditions and dirty business","I think Francis Ford Coppola has delivered an amazing analysis on family traditions with The Godfather, which I consider his masterpiece.

Considering that it opened in 1972, and analyzing all the violence-full sequences, it is not strange to read about it as ""shocking"" in several reviews.

The Godfather and The Godfather part II are some of the movies you just HAVE to see. In part II, F.F.C. tells two stories: Vito Corleone's acension to power and Michael Corleone's new life as the new Godfather.

I'd give them both an 11 out of 10."

10,Great film,This is a wonderful film I really enjoyed this movie
10,Excellent,"This movie is phenomenal. Coppola's masterpiece one of my favorite movie. Great casting, great writing, great directing. Coppola has made one of the best cult movies of all time. This movie aged well, his 34 years old but still has a strong cultural influence. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are insane. They acting is phenomenal. This movie has a really strong part. The Godfather is not just a mafia movie, it's not a move just for the mafia and crime movie fans, this movie is recommended for everyone. The movie has a great artistic approach and a great message. The movie is so memorable a lasts for a life."
9,was perfect.,"""The Godfather"" is one of the most impressive and unforgettable productions in the history of cinema. The film manages to impress the audience by offering a realistic look at the mafia world. ""The Godfather"" has a great atmosphere with Marlon Brando's unique acting, Francis Ford Coppola's direction and Mario Puzo's flawless script. I can say that the movie has a rightful place in the history of cinema thanks to the depth of the characters, the fluidity of the story and its unique atmosphere. The Godfather is a successful and impressive mafia movie. Al Pacino is truly a very qualified and successful actor. He does justice to the role and conveys the emotion very well."
2,Great Acting...,Great Acting dreadful editing. It's one of those must see movies but its just over rated. Watch the horse's head scene and see how badly edited it is...terrible seeing as everyone holds it in such high regard. Wobbly sound and out of focus cuts throughout. Coppola should be ashamed.
10,very good,"The growth and death of a man, the rise and fall of a family. Brotherly love, father and son love, rational and emotional love, friendship, men face the sacrifice and responsibility of family, career, love, the opposition and unity of justice and evil, is interpreted in the film. Countless classic lines, many unforgettable plots.It is also a very classic movie so far."
10,Masterpiece,"Godfather Trilogy, is a masterpiece of international cinematography!"
10,A flawless movie that is a pleasure to watch,"This is my favorite movie. This on the surface is a movie about the Mafia, but if you scratch the surface, you realize this is a movie about family and about the consequences of being loyal to your family. Michael in the beginning is an all-American war hero, who is obviously not part of the family business. Michael transforms so subtly into a murderous, remorseless man, that you don't even notice it until the very end. Every actor is perfect, Brando gives the performance of his life. If you have not seen this movie(or even if you have), go rent it at the video store, make some pasta and spaghetti sauce, and enjoy!"

10,Some points from the beginning of the movie,"Everyone here have watched the movie, so I will save the effort to describe the movie again. After all, this movie is brilliant! One thing I like Don Vito Corleone is that he beat (though not depicted in the movie) the s**t out of the two punks who used violence on a girl. Nowadays, too many Americans ONLY blame other people or other things like they are the ONLY innocent ones. They kill because the video games are so violent, they steal because they cannot find a job paying them $30/hour to let them be a slacker, they sexually abuse minors because they are under control of the drug or alcohol, they are fat because the food is too delicious to resist. As a grown-up person, everybody should be responsible for his own wrongdoings. The video games will not open the TV by themselves, the alcohol or drug will not go into the body by itself and the delicious food will not go straight from the deep fryer into the stomach. This is a lesson I learned from Godfather, which is especially valuable in a world full of selfishness and cowardice."
9,It's much more than just a movie,"While the plot of this movie is amazing, star cast is outstanding, cinematography and background music are masterpieces in themselves - the part which I like the most about this movie is how perfectly it depicts the influence of the cultural during those days over the society. The fine and minute details of lavishing lives of these underworld mafias, suppression of even elite women in almost every class of society and a lot more is put forth by this movie. The movie is full of twists and holds on to the audience. Your adrenaline level can be fairly high during these three and a half hours of your live. A must watch."
6,Hey,"I try to find an old animation movie that I watched as a kid on TV in the 90s (it could be older) and made an enduring impression on me. I remember the ending most vividly: a bloody battle on the top of a hill where two armies clashed, apparently led by a man and a woman inside cyborgs or some kind of robotic vehicle. These two seemed to share a history (fling?? / siblings??) and confronted each other beside a nearby river. They both died. The movie ended tragically with a shot of the great tree on the top of the hill, surrounded by corpses of both armies..

The only other thing I recall is a young man and a woman that spent the night in a house and in the morning the woman transformed in a butterfly and flew away. The man tried to catch her but without success. The butterflies (souls??) seemed central to the movie.

It was all very depressing (as you can imagine :-P) but it was so powerful animation that stuck to my head for years! I tried to find it in IMDb, google and anime sites through keywords but to no avail. It seemed to be Japanese animation but I cannot be sure.."
4,An offer you can't refuse,"One of the jewels in the crown of the 70s cinema, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. Itialian immigrants, caring people, and mafioso. From the first frame in which you see Marlon Brando's face lit from in front and above like a dark angel to the last frame of the last film in which Al Pacino's wineglass falls out of his hand as he slumps, the family gone and destroyed.

The Godfather is the holy trinity of mob films. Every film after it has its influences in it, and, much like some people look towards the Star Wars trilogy for an answer to every question, many people do so for The Godfather."
10,Thank god,"Just « Don Al Pacino »

It's a movie you have to look in your life,

Script 10/10 Acting 10/10."
8,The Godfather is in no short supply of action and suspense.,"The Godfather

Smart. That's how I describe `The Godfather'. Every aspect of this film is dripping with intellect. The directing, the writing, the cinematography, and the acting. And all the elements of the film are woven tightly together to make a very entertaining package. The intricate plot follows the development of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and the enthralling drama that pursues his `family'. The script does the impossible task of capturing the complex politics of organized crime, and makes it interesting to boot. The plot leads the audience along its windy path where it comes across many peaks until it finally builds to the fantastic finale. To achieve this famous finish, the director employs the use of some pretty clever technical tricks. To achieve suspense, he cleverly places the camera at angles that leads the audience one way, until he surprises them with the real result later on. He also infuses the sound of the church organ music and the crying baby, and then gradually increases the decibels subtly and effectively. That technique pulled the viewers in and made their knuckles white during the climax of the film. The director was skillful in his mastery of all the film's techniques and in getting what he needed from the actors. This strong cast of cast of actors included Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Conn. Each actor portrayed their characters profoundly. Marlon Brando executed method acting techniques in a way that only a veteran like Marlon could. Al Pacino clearly shows his character (Michael Corleone) grow and change. His acting is subtle, confident and quiet until it explodes in an awesome rage. Michael Corleone is much like the entire movie. `The Godfather' is subtle and complex, and it builds to the memorable finish. `The Godfather' stimulates the mind and starts the blood and adrenaline pumping in anyone who watches it. That is why I recommend this beautiful masterpiece to anyone and everyone with a thirst for quality film."
10,"Pure brilliance, cinema at it's best.","Have you ever wanted to watch a movie with decency and class, with elegance and stature. If so, then this is it. The Godfather provides the audience with stunning acting, dialogue and memorable scenes.

The acting is phenomenal, with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and John Cazale all putting forward Oscar worthy performances.

The story is brilliant, director Francis Ford Coppola really put a lot of thought into this and the way the story is shown, it never loses interest, even though the film is two and a half hours long. If you stay focused, you stay amazed.

If the acting and plot weren't good enough, be prepared to be blown away by the classic theme for this movie, the way it is put into the scenes really adds to he grand stature of the movie.

It's a 10/10 and a definite watch for movie lovers with a good taste."
10,GOAT!,"Perfect movie does not exist.

Godfather : Hold my wine!"
10,GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"Impressive. The Godfather is a more important film, of course it is. But The Godfather Part II is a better film. It's more ambitious, it's more elegiac, it delves deeper into the soil of Italian-American myth, plus... what were they thinking of, trying to match the critical and commercial dynamite of the first film? The Godfather Part II was, from conception upwards, an insane project. But it worked. When I watched this movie I was amazed that how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role of it has been played by a famous and good actor before. And most problem to play younger Don was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando."
10,Masterpiece,"Unbelievable as it may sound, the first time I watched The Godfather I got too tired and we stopped the tape. After that I didn't forgive myself until I finally decided to rent it again. The second time around I made it to the end and I loved it. Of all the movies I've watched, I feel that this one has had the biggest impact on me. To me, being allowed to watch The Godfather is a gift. It's more than just watching a great movie: It's like observing a timeless piece of art by Leonardo Da Vinci.

The Godfather is a movie that tells the touching and invincible tail of the Corleones, an Italian family living in New York that is involved in the mafia affairs in the city. A drug lord named Virgil Sollozzo wants to start shipping drugs all over New York and asks Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to help him with his affairs. Corleone does not approve of the idea and would rather stick to his own business. Angry with the rejection, Sollozzo sends two of his thugs try to kill him, but he survives. Michael (Al Pacino), the youngest of all the sons, wants to be the man to protect his father, although the other members of the family don't want him caught up in the affair. The plot rises in levels of drama and thrills as the film goes on, and it just gets better and better. Most of the scenes easily stand out as some of the greatest moments in movie history, such as:

The beginning. What else? No one could ever forget the thought provoking scenes with Brando stroking his cat and negotiating with his close friends and relatives.

Michael's assassination of the cop and Sollozzo at a small diner.

Michael being named the new godfather.

The killings of family enemies during the baptism.

Of course, these are not the only fantastic scenes in the movie. The Godfather also has an A++ cast, like almost everyone who has watched it will tell you. It practically made the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and of course, Al Pacino. Best of all, it has Marlon Brando at what could be his finest (I still haven't seen Apocalypse Now). I know it's been said many times, but I'll add my two cents anyway by saying that The Godfather is a classic and is pretty much flawless.

***** out of *****"
9,Absolutely magnificent,"The Godfather is one of the most important masterpieces in the history of cinema. The film takes the audience on a deep journey with a family drama story set in the mafia world, while also dealing with universal themes such as power, loyalty, betrayal and family ties.

Through the lives of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his son Michael (Al Pacino), the moral contradictions experienced at the intersection of crime and family love are emphasized. Brando's performance perfectly reflects the depth and power of the character, making him one of the most iconic figures in the history of cinema. Al Pacino's transformation in the role of Michael Corleone deeply affects the audience. While dark shadows and slow motions create tension and dramatic intensity throughout the film, the music also strengthens the atmosphere.

The Godfather is not only a crime story, but also a narrative that questions the complexity of human nature, traces social and individual power and becomes universal over time.

In the world of cinema, this masterpiece continues to become more valuable with each passing year."
7,All Time Favourite Movie,"This movie has strong script, excellent acting, great directing."
10,Masterpiece nothing less,"This movie is my most favourite movie and for good reasons, first of all kudos to the actors in this movie and Marlo Brando for smashing it outside the stadium.

As for the plot, the mafia family crime thriller drama intrigued me so much, the directing style of Frank Ford Coppola, the mesmerizing scores help to elevate the movie watching experience more than anything.

A MUST WATCH."

Rizvi Hasan's goal is that one day he will go further. Rizvi Hasan wants to win the hearts of his audience through better work."
10,Greatest Mob oriented movie ever made,"The Godfather,1972, is the movie by which other mob classics are compared to. Although not categorized as a ""Mob Movie"", it is what all other mob movies are compared to. the story is great, the acting unsurpassed. By the time the movie ends you are rooting for the ""bad guys"", the Corleone family. Other great movies such as Goodfellas, Casino, Bugsey etc. are good, fun and entertaining, these latter movies show the lower level mobster, whereas the Godfather shows what life is like if you are on the top of the syndicate ladder. Keep in mind that as great as this movie is in real life the mob's retirement plan isn't all that great!!"
9,Bada-bing!,"A masterpiece is just about all there is to say about this film. A cinematic jewel who's only competition is its own sequel. The Godfather is probably the most quoted (and spoofed) movie in history. Every single thing about this film is perfect. The home-movie feel, the cast, the crew- everything. What more is there to say? 10/10"
10,review,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..

Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. As well Marlon Brando was amazing in this movie.

This is definitely a masterpiece."
9,Stunning performance,The story is enough of an attraction but looking back at this years after first watch it in the Cinema Al Pacino's performance can be seen for the brilliant actor he is.
6,It's not that great.,"I get that movies were much slower in the 70s, but this movie isn't really all that great. Goodfellas and Casino so far surpass this boring movie. Oops, I guess my review was too short. The Godfather is boring, and Marlon Brando isn't actually a good actor. No one likes him in any of his roles. ""Stella! I coulda been a contender."" I'm not sure what else I can say, but I need another 200+ letters. Killing off Sonny was stupid, and Michael wouldn't suddenly become a gangster. Just about everything about this movie is stupid. I still have 49 more letters that I need to type. Lefties in LA are stupid people."
1,Over rated,"Goodfellow, bronx tail, casino, scarface, meanic to society, Boyz n the hood, fresh, and Donnie brosco are way better in my eyes. Honestly American gangster and legend is better than tgis movie. I will never understand why godfather is at the top of most these list. To me godfather, godfather 2, and the Irish man are the worst gangster movies. I've tried 8 times to watch this longest was hour boring. Please bring this movie down on list. Love every actor, director, others involved but just can't stand this series."
10,Best Movie,The best movie of all time! With the best actors! Top 10! Love it!
9,The Goofather!! Classic movie,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Nathan Rudd Actor"
10,classic,"An ordinary man, who broke his throat and couldn't find a serious listener, but the slurred godfather, no one dared to ignore every word he said. He is always expressionless, but there is a power that cannot be ignored behind him-an elegant rage, calm cruelty, and makeup evil, like a mixture of viper and tiger."
9,What more can be said?,"Amazing film / amazing cast / amazing writers / amazing production / amazing everything, 100% ahead of its time. Just breathtaking. Can't add anything that hasn't already been said about this picture."
10,Mario puzzo; unread book but seen movie.,Italian Mafia who kill and go rich; government takes their money. No credits to this cast and crew but at the Awards. The story did not need to ring a bell in memory but movie reviewers like to seat in chairs with no cushions and watch 'The Godfather'. Review to the movie is that the further research into films that is done; the analytic is that light their was impressionistic. The shoot in movies are with lights in the backdrop that are with people and barricades; no photography without permission. It is not allowed to publish or view these contents that are from backstage and the reasons are unavoidable because the crew spent their work in preserving that truth that should be viewed at cinema halls or in digital video devices. On the television the story of the 'Godfather' is featured with the set of box. Plugging in to the channel proves validly that watching 'The Godfather' starring Marlon Brando as 'Godfather' will not lead to him adopting a child from us. Recommending 'The Godfather' to viewers because it is a Marlon Brando film and books have been written on the former and latter.
8,Amazing,"Such a great and amazing movie, God Father a marvelloues movie with a great screenplay and also a great cast."
7,Great movie,"This movie is great, although it is not perfect. Growing up i would always hear that this is the greatest movie of all time, and when i finally sat down to watch it I had a blast. Its filled with many great performances, great cinematography, and etc. The reason I am giving it a 7 is because i feel it has a pacing issue, theres a lot of unneeded shots and not every performance was believable."
2,"The God Father? More like the Nod Father - as in I would rather be Nodding off from heroin instead of watching this cheap, crummy boring movie.","""Gangster"" Movie - that is the genre of movie Scorschssassey try to invent with this movie. How can it be gangster when Tupac and 50 Cents didnt get to be in it?

Someone said in my Movies For Mother's Facebook Groop that this has the Allstars Cast - but the only one I knew is Al Pacino, but it must've bee the other Al Pacino because this one wasn't old and was not turning into a turkey...

Roger Duval? Dont know em. Marilyn Brando? Who the heck is that . Sorry for using that sorts of harsh language but I was so offended by how old and stupid and boring the whole thing is. Like there wasn't any car-chases or aliens or anyting!

And it makes Mexicans look like a bunch of evil criminals! I would watch the sequal to this just so I could be qualify to right a review on Godfather 2 (which stars Roger DeNiro from The Joker) where he actually goes back to Mexico and they actually speak -in- Mexican for the Hole Movie. But I dont want to be any more offended or bored by old, cheap nobody movies like this anymore...

TLDR: Just go to the nearest street-corner where the Spanish people like in this movey sell drugs and buy some heroin because Nodding off from that is much cheaper, shorter and funner than watching the Nod Fathers."
9,story of a living person,"I like this movie very much, it is made in a very good way, I don't think it is a movie, I think I am watching the story of a living person."
10,"Perfect, just perfect.","I might have been biased because I think I fell in love with this classic movie before I even watched it but my expectations were absolutely met, may have even exceeded.

The movie begins, black screen but you hear the music, then ""I believe in America..."". Perfect. The man tells the Godfather his story. Instantly grabbing my attention.

The characters, dialogue, music, cinematography, everything is just what I consider perfection.

Such a deep and relatable story even if it's a story about the Italian Mafia.

I only ended up having one issue, just one issue but it's a small. The scene with the Godfather glitching up when playing with his grandson lol."
10,the best movie I've seen,"This movie is excellent. Anyone wanting proof of its greatness, just watch the baptism sequence, filmmaking at its best..... I really liked Coppala's style of having narrative scenes for a while, then punctuating it with sudden and brief scenes of violence. Everything about this movie is great. If you have not seen go to your locall video shop and watch it!"
8,exelent,Best film i know very good wallah c dla frappe ya rien a dire un peu long mais tres lourd
10,Awesome Film,I like This Movie Very Much GodFather I think its seasons should release Now in 2020 lOL
10,Just changed Cinema forever,"I was born in 2002 but even this movie is not out of my generation it is one of my favorite movies. The theme, the cast, the story... Everything is just perfect an overwhelming. Thanks Coppola for this masterpiece of movie."
6,"Decent, but massively overrated","It's a fairly decent gangster film. If that's your sort of thing, I can see why you'd rate it highly, but otherwise it's fairly forgettable. I wouldn't have bothered with a review if I didn't think it's rating and acclaim were so misplaced.

The acting was good, and there are some memorable scenes, but spaced out far too much - 3 hours is a very long time for a film with such an aimless and meandering plot. There are lots of story threads introduced throughout the film, but none of them really stuck with for long enough to get invested in the characters or what was happening."
1,boring and bad,"Boring just boring , I mean how can this sheet get 9.2"
10,The goatfather,"I watched the godfather twice. The first time I gave it 3 stars. The first time I must have been deluded. This movie is nothing short of perfect. Everything about it. One of my favourites things about this movie is the music. This movie hooks you from the second don corleone turns around. I was astounded to find out that no violence happens in this movie until 45 minutes in. And when it starts happening it goes hell for leather.

I refuse to believe anyone has anything bad to say about the preformances in this movie. Obviously you have the iconic Marlon brando preformance and Robert de Niro is brilliant. But honest my favourite preformance is James caan as sonny. That guy is so great in his preformance. This is a movie everyday has to see at least once in their life."
10,Not another movie like it!,"The Godfather is on a league of its own, giving a raw insight into the mafia world, this film will go down as the G.O.A.T! it is easily everybody's ""desert island"" pick.

The godfather is filled with the perfect amount of:

Action Drama Comedy

and romance, it truly ticks all the boxes for any film fanatic."
10,The best movie ever made,"The more we watch it, the more we see the perfection in the movie."
10,The Reality,"This movie should be watched thanks to its reality that is surrounding around people's life. İt is very successful that mafia family, relating departments and citizens which are shown as reality facts in time condition of 1900s. İt is the most important point of the Godfather movie that people which are related closely with movie and novel, is successfully combined. Before you watched a movie, they should read Mario Puzzo's novel so you can exactly improve movie information. We can say that the most successful adaptation movie in Hollywood movie sector. Especially, when we look at the daily movie, we can exactly see the Godfather's importance and affects. I assume that this movie series affect all movie sector which are consist of actor, actress, screenplay, editor etc... I want to give an importance that the reality factor of this movie. We can not find the reality factor on daily movie because of the fact that computer science and using improved in movies."
10,The Godfather: A Timeless Masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is more than a movie; it's a cultural touchstone. It has influenced countless filmmakers, spawning a legacy that extends far beyond its own runtime. As a 38-year-old movie lover, I can confidently say that ""The Godfather"" remains a timeless masterpiece that continues to inspire and resonate with each viewing. If you haven't experienced this cinematic gem yet, it's high time you did. It's not just a film; it's an unforgettable journey into the heart of darkness and the human soul.

What truly sets ""The Godfather"" apart is its ability to transcend its crime drama label. It's not merely a story about gangsters; it's a meditation on power, morality, and the American dream. It challenges our notions of right and wrong, blurring the lines between hero and antihero. The film's universal themes make it accessible and relatable to audiences of all backgrounds and generations."
6,My thoughts,"this was one of the best movies by far. I researched that this was one of the best blockbusters selling point. Although the movie is great no matter what day and age you watch it. I don't think it will be a great idea to try to remake this movie . The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts. I would love to see another movie like this that is based out in Hollywood like this movie. If you read the book you would understand why there's so many books and movies and most movies don't stand toe and toe with the book but this one did. This is a old movie way before my time but the thrill and the envy of all the characters , family love it make you keep wanting to keep watching."
5,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""","An underground family represented as a ""necessary evil"" address the requests of local members who are unsatisfied with law enforcement results. Here you will find a man that runs an empire, hoping his family will continue his legacy of justice."
8,Thankyou,The best movie thanks for helping me to watch this
9,"Any man who must say ""I am the king"" is no true king","Godfather is about mafia families and how they handle their business. We follow the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) is the head of family and a very powerful man while his son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) he tries to stay away from their dirty business. Marlon Brando was excellent in this film every time he was on the screen I was captivated. His facial expressions and his silent dominance is what you expect from a ""Godfather"". Remember any man who must say ""I am the king"" is no true king. You heavily see how important family is for a mafia man(and italian also) and how everything revolves around it. While Al Pacino portrays beautifully the son who slowly tries to learn the ropes of the job. The movie has heavy dialogues and the most scenes are people talking then acting for brief moment then talking again I really liked that , its not fast-paced not slow-paced either is just the perfect combination. Music was really good , I feel like if the music was not on point we will be talking for an entirely different movie whatsoever. Definitely a must see."
10,Brilliant,"The Godfather in my opinion is one of the best and well produced movie I've seen. I've seen it many times and it always feel like it's the first time watching. It's an excellent film to watch by yourself or with friends (movie night). You're certainly in for a treat if it's going to be your first time watching The Godfather. It's long and I suggest turning your phone off. It's just shy of 3 hours, but it's so good that it will feel like 10 minutes."
10,Greatest mob saga ever.,"One of the greatest movies ever made. And amazingly, surpassed by the even more expansive and epic ""Godfather Part II"". Iconic in every sense of the word."
9,The perfect Entertainer,"Well i have seen the movie first before reading the book and i must say that Francis Coppala has done an excellent job to the movie. Everything in it is so realistic, it simply goes on and on. Well this is an absolute great movie."
10,Masterpiece 🔥,"The movie is literally is THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME bro the Acting is extremely brilliant it's. Seems like it's real. Money, business, power, greed. That's I say extraordinary. Acting like it's real. Soundtrack is Best. It's it's next level. Cinematography iss great and the costumes sets, storytelling is epic. Dont read my reviews on this website or app go and Watch you will thanks me later. But this movie iss slow paced this movie not released in this xyz year it's released on 1972 which.has been for a long time. Sometimes you may feel a bit bored in between. Because we all like fast paced movies, action or romantic, but this movie is a bit different, so you can watch it with your friends and friends. Enjoy 🔥"
10,awesome,That's awesome movie for everytime. And absolutely must be watch. Thank you.
6,Good,I dont really understand the thrill because my country doesnt have mafia things.
4,Zzzzzzz,Snoozefest deluxe. Would not recommend watching this movie.
10,First Movie I remember watching,"The godfather to me is the benchmark that I use to rate all movies that I watch. Its the very first movie that I can recall watching when I was younger.

No words can describe the depth and greatness of this iconic film."
9,Offer you can't refuse,"This film put mafia films out there many parts of it are undeniably perfect acting, cinematography and story-telling.

It introduces us to the cruel world it is where power buys you respect, and it is earned through putting fear into people.

The Godfathers only criticism is it's slowness - and today no films like that could ever be put into production - and it might have to be viewed more seriously then other films but definitely worth the watch. Shout out to Marlon Brando for giving us the best piece of acting in history."
10,A complete package...You need to watch it!,"One of the best motion pictures having a complete package of awesome acting, cinematography, direction and almost everything. The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction to the acting, to the story-line, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time.

This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. It's amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together. . . .

8,Blockbuster,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10. A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

9,"A superb, yet confusing movie","""The Godfather"" is an extremely well known movie and one that

this reviewer just recently saw for the first time. There is a lot of

talk about it being the best movie ever made but honestly, there

are other movies that could be better. The cast was made up of

some pretty famous actors and they all did marvelous acting jobs.

The movie definitely wasn't lacking in that area. It was a big

attention getter in the way that there could be a scene where the

actors would be talking and talking, which isn't too exciting, and

then soon after it would be like ""BAM!"" and there was action. It

would certainly wake up anyone in the audience who might have

been dozing off. All in all, the movie didn't have too much talk, or

too much action, it was just the right amount of both.

It did have a superflous amount of special effects though, most

being gun shots and explosions. Considering the fact that the

movie is about the life of a crime family, the enormous amount of

killing that there is throughout the film isn't too suprising. Maybe a

little disturbing, but not suprisng. This reviewer has never seen a

movie with as much killing as ""The Godfather."" It was like

someone was killed from this family, so they killed the person who

did the killing. Then that family killed the person who killed their

family member and it went on like that back and forth and back and

forth, if that even makes sense. It was like an argument. Person #

1 says something to person # 2, so person #2 says something

back to person #1 and so on and so on. There was just an

excessive amount of killing. In fact, all the killing is sort of the thing

that the viewer might remember the most about ""The Godfather."" This movie does something that a lot of movies dare not do. It lets

some main characters die. That is probably the most unpredictable aspect of the entire movie. When people watch

movies they don't expect any main characters to die and they rarely

ever do. The fact that ""The Godfather"" does this, although it is

sad, is stupendous. The plot of the movie revolves around the crime family, Corleone.

It basically follows their lives during a certain period of time. What

that period of time is, this reviewer does not exactly know. In most

movies, when there has been a big time difference they say at the

bottom of the screen, ""one year later"" or something like that. ""The

Godfather"" does not do that. Instead of putting the time change

into words at the bottom of the screen it's put into words that the

actors say. It makes it so the audience has to listen very closely to

the movie to hear how long its been since something happened.

This reveiwer thinks that this is done because when words are put

at the bottom of the screen, like subtitles, it distracts the viewer's

attention away from the movie and what is going on. In ""The

Godfather"" there is not this problem. The clothing worn in the movie wasn't anything like big, fancy

costumes, but there was something about them that was quite

interesting. If the viewer was really paying attention to the actors'

outfits they would notice that the men are always wearing some

type of suit. They're never caught walking around in casual wear,

just suits. And the women are always wearing dresses. They

don't wear pants with t-shirts, they wear dresses. Tha'ts pretty

grand if you ask me. ""The Godfather"" was a very superb movie, but there are others that

are better. It's worst feature is the enormous amount of killing. It

is entertaining to watch, but it's not one that this reviewer would

want to watch over and over again."
10,Great Movie,"What a Movie. Suspense, Story Everthing is amazing"
10,It has an amazing set of actors,Nice movie. It has an amazing set of actors. I like this movie. This movie is perfect. I give 10 star. God father is one of the top movie in imdp. Thank you.
7,Like,I love this movie love love loveee and you bedes lon on it plzzzz
2,The Godfather is like a perfectly painted fruit bowl,"A painted fruit bowl will not make you cry. It won't make you terrified. It's not romantic either and it won't change your mind on what you already thought about fruits. Yet it can still be a masterfully painted fruit bowl where al the fruits are beautifully portrayed by the artist the way they are. The Godfather is such a movie.

Just like most fruit bowl paintings, you wouldn't know if you had to root for the apple or the grapes. And during the entire movie you already know the fruits only have 2 possible outcomes: getting eaten or getting rot. I could go on with my analogy but I think you get the point. (edit: I will go on anyway)

Will you like this film? Well, some people will stand in front of a perfectly painted fruit bowl for 5 minutes and become utterly bored because of the subject. Others can stand there for days being amazed by the details on the apple, and discovers new perfections every time they are watching the painting.

There is no good or wrong here. Everyone has their personal taste. After watching The Godfather you know what kind of person you are. I absolutely do recommend you watch it for yourself. At the end fruit bowl paintings (or other versions of still lives) have become very iconic and appreciated. Hopefully i made you hungry to see this masterfully crafted icon of a movie called The Godfather."
8,Good story,Good story that border on realism. Can watch but a bit boring for those who wants more actions but again this is not an action movie. Enjoy!
10,Amazing Movie,"""Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this epic crime saga revolves around the Corleone family, led by the iconic Don Vito Corleone. Marlon Brando delivers a mesmerizing performance as the patriarch, while Al Pacino shines as his reluctant successor, Michael Corleone. The film's intricate plot, rich character development, and powerful themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the consequences of power make it a timeless classic. With its flawless direction, stellar cast, and unforgettable score, ""The Godfather"" continues to captivate audiences and stand as one of the greatest films ever made."
10,Cinema at its best,"I think people here have said pretty much all that needs to be said about this film. Just watch it if you haven't done so already, this is pure quality regarding plot, acting, music, everything."
10,An Iconic film,"This movie is flawless, it has amazing acting, powerful dialogs and great cinematography. I watches this today and I wish I watched it wat earlier"
10,Best movie ever,"Inspired by the novel by Mario Puzo, the film is a grand story of Don Vito Corleone, a Sicilian mobster, got the head of a major mafia networks in America. The film shows a very realistic view of the world where the word given less accessible and promises have a capital value and honor is the highest price. Unfortunately for him, when his life is in danger, his children can not stay away from danger, and they are trained in this highly risky game of battles between mafia clans in America. Respect, murder, money and, above all, power: these are the words that best define this film and its action. Probably the best movie ever. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie."
8,Great movie but overrated,"Watching a 3 hour long movie it's not a easy task unless you really enjoy the story and every single moment of it, but I really had to give this a try to find by myself if it really lives up to his hype. Needless to say, the acting is by far the best thing in this movie especially Marlon Brando in his unforgettable Don Corleone role. The cinematography is very good too and the only critics I have is some flaws in shooting scenes were the gun is fired but the body doesn't get marked and some fighting scenes were they were literally punching the air but I would let that slip because they didn't had much of the technology that we have nowadays. My biggest problem regarding this movie is pacing, like I've said in the beginning it's hard to watch a 3 hour long movie unless everything works perfectly and in this movie there were a lot of scenes way to bigger than the necessary, things that could be summoned in a shorter way and still with good cinematography were too long, and there are some unnecessary shots. The movie also advance years and it could've been done better, in a scene you are in the present and in the next you are some years later without no mention to how many time passed or even that the time passed you only understand that by the action, which if you aren't really concentrated will become confusing and It's hard to see a 3 hour long movie with long boring shots and confusing timeline. The acting is the only top-notch thing here, everything else is just good."
10,One of the best movies ever made,"Widely viewed around the world as one of the best American films ever made, the opening movie from the crime saga The Godfather is a milestone of cinema history. The Godfather, together with Star Wars, from 1972 has become one of the most parodied movies ever. Director Francis Ford Coppola paints an amazing portrait of the Corleone clan's rise and near fall from power in the US as well as in Italy. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully manages to balance the story between the Corleone's family life and the vast crime business in which they are engaged.The story views the Mafia from the inside as Francis Ford Coppola saw it, and as Mario Puzo did when he originally wrote the book in which he portrayed the story presented here. This movie is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon, capicce."
5,Violence,"This movie is pure of violence, massacres, deaths, killings which I hoped that there is nothing like this anymore in our generation. I somehow like the movie for its showing the reality that we're in. Nevertheless, this is something thats not be shown to our children."
10,My favorite.,"It's a travesty that this movie hasn't picked up more Oscar awards. I mean, Al Pacino's nomination was for Best Supporting Actor... give me a break. Honestly, I don't see how this masterpiece din't take home at least 10 golden statuettes. It took so much guts and fight from Ruddy and Coppola to deliver what we see on screen. As filmmakers and cinema lovers, we are all indebted to the filmmakers, cast, and crew for pulling resources, putting up with threats of being fired, and ultimately giving it all for this movie to come together. I must have seen it 50 times in its 50 years since the release and it's a treat to my senses every time."

10,Film's greatest achievement,"Few movies have ever come close to this epic. It is the most intelligently and brilliantly woven piece of work that any man in the film industry has ever created. The genius of 'Coppola of the 70s' and the brilliance of the man are in perfect display here. Words escape me to describe this movie. Starting from the foundations of one of the greatest novels (kudos to Signor Puzo) it gains tremendous strength from the greatest acting, directing, producing and scriptwriting that one can come across."
10,one of the best movie,"Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour."
10,The climax movie,"While other movies have a climax in it, Godafather itself is a climax expressed into a movie. It is so tense that you keep watching till the end wishing it never ends..."
8,Opera movie making,"What can be written that has not been written already. The Godfather is the classic, genre-defining Mafia movie in which Marlon Brando plays the titular character facing grave threats from rival families. Unsurprisingly, there's constant violence. Characters are shot and killed, often at close range in graphic scenes. Characters are strangled to death and die in car explosions. Domestic abuse is shown: A man beats his wife with a belt. In one of many iconic scenes, a movie executive wakes up covered in blood, with a decapitated horse's head in his bed. In the opening scene, a man asks Don Corleone for vengeance after two men raped and beat his daughter. The movie also has cigarette smoking, wine drinking, and brief nudity (female breasts), and characters are shown having sex, clothed but audible. There are some references made to the sexual behaviors of Sonny and Fredo. In short,this movie is an opera without the music."
10,nice,"This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in ""The Godfather""."
10,This movie is a masterpiece,"**The Godfather (1972) - A Cinematic Masterpiece**

**Rating: 10/10**

Francis Ford Coppola's *The Godfather* is not just a film; it's an epic saga of power, family, and morality that redefined cinema. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, this crime drama is a flawless blend of storytelling, acting, and direction, making it one of the greatest films ever made.

### **Performances** Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch of the Corleone crime family. His quiet authority and subtle expressions make Don Vito both terrifying and sympathetic. Al Pacino, in a star-making role as Michael Corleone, undergoes a chilling transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless mafia boss-his arc is nothing short of mesmerizing. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, adds depth and intensity to every scene.

### **Direction & Writing** Coppola's direction is masterful, balancing brutal violence with intimate family drama. The screenplay (co-written by Coppola and Puzo) is sharp, layered, and filled with unforgettable lines (*""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""*). The pacing is deliberate, drawing viewers into the Corleones' world with a hypnotic grip.

### **Cinematography & Score** Gordon Willis's shadowy cinematography creates a moody, almost operatic atmosphere, while Nino Rota's haunting score lingers long after the film ends. The wedding sequence, the restaurant assassination, and the climactic baptism montage are visual storytelling at its finest.

### **Legacy** *The Godfather* set the standard for crime dramas, influencing countless films and TV shows. It's a tragic, gripping tale of loyalty and corruption, where family is both a blessing and a curse. More than 50 years later, it remains timeless.

**Verdict:** A perfect film in every aspect. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on cinema history. **10/10.**"
7,The Godfather,"After spending three hours to watch the film, I think it was a good way to study violence, power and honor. Also the justice and crime in America.

One of the center of the story is ""family"". In the film, there is one sentence""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."". Family is always the best support. I think one of the reasons of the success of the Corleone's business is their good relationship of the family. every time they did their job, they have a good plan.

The movie has the best actors, they can show the characteristic of the character, the whispering of Marlon Brando(the godfather), the smart and wise of Al Pacino(Michael), the stable of Robert Duvall(Tom)...

The only weakness of the film is too long, nearly three hours, some of it was quite bore. Anyway, it was one the best movie I have ever seen."
2,Did not care for it.,"I didn't really care for it, I didn't like it. I know everyone says it's so good, and yeah, Robert De Niro is in it (he's a fine actor) but I didn't like it. I couldn't get into it. It just insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in; you spend like six and a half hours just waiting, I can't get through, I've never even finished the movie. I've never seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it, and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different language. You know, that's where I lose interest in it."
10,I wasn't a fan but then I realised,"Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
10,Best movie,Godfather isnt a movie Godfather is a lifestyle great real scenes Stunning performances It's better for everyone to watch this movie
10,This Amazing MOvie The Best The Godfather,"This Amazing Movie A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.

I like it."
9,The Godfather: A Timeless Cinematic Triumph,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) is a cinematic landmark, captivating with its tale of power, family, and crime. Marlon Brando's iconic Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone are legendary performances. The film's attention to detail immerses viewers in a bygone era, while Gordon Willis's cinematography sets a moody tone. Nino Rota's score is unforgettable. Coppola's direction weaves a rich narrative tapestry that's both deliberate and gripping. ""The Godfather"" is a timeless masterpiece that continues to influence and enthrall, defining cinematic excellence for generations."
9,time,"Times are not the same, the road to go is not the same, talk about righteousness heavy family talk about the era of commitment."
10,The most powerful motion picture ever developed on celluloid,"I've always thought of the Godfather as a family film a king with 3 sons the eldest given his courage, the next his cool head and calmness and the youngest his wit and innocence. Except with this family film the family members are murderers and thieves."
10,"The film,, presents the story of a man","The film,, presents the story of a man during an American labor movement where labor was depicted to be too intricate and prosperous to care for the underprivileged. The labor movement portrayed in the movie is perceived to be extremely powerful, powerful to the extent that its interests are always met. The movie is set in the present day (1979) rural south with the protagonist Norma Rae, a Southern mill worker with two children. The film provides a significant evaluation of the radicalism that was portrayedby southern managers and how they learned to oppress the unprivileged when they were able to resist their legal rights."
10,The Best Film Ever!,And it hasn't aged a bit! I watch it and rewatch it and never get tired of it. Marlon Brando gave the most brilliant acting performance. Al Pacino is also unforgettable.
1,nah,Dude it's not that good. Just sayin. IMDB-users just have to watch more movies so that The Godfather stops being on the top of every film-list on this site.
9,Perfection,"Script is awesome, cast, directing, movie rocks forever."
10,Life Changing,This is one of the greatest creations of the cinema history! I don't know how many times I have watched this! San T
10,Headline,Awesome movieeeeeeeeeee I like these kind of moviessssssssssssssss
9,great,"The director launches this romantic gangster epic in a gloomy and calm style, and discusses more about the relationship between rights and crimes in the alternation of rights."
10,Classic,"One of the best movies out there, deserves the ranking it has. An all time classic, can't go wrong with the Godfather."
9,This film is classic,"You need to watch this movie beyond be a mark in the history of cinema, Coppola add a new way to direct, you get so involved with the history and the things that start to happen that really don't realize how long the film is. The film also have a incredible production and keep the majority fidelity possible with the book just have little things missing and others not add. In the first scene you can realize how Coppola was super careful in details of the movie the typical big wedding in a Italian shape same being in USA, the songs and way people dance and get connected you feel like watching not a move but a oracle crystal ball where you can see everything happening rich of details and feelings."
10,Best ever,It's without doubt the best movie ever made. The film's picture is incredible even though it was filmed in 1972.
1,Bad,"Bad movie In The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppla is either a bad director or a hypocrite. The audience cheers for the Corleones, despite all Coppola points to to try to prove he disapproves of the mafia. Can Al Pacino portray an ordinary American? Brando nearly sinks Part I with his Hey! Look at me! Performance. He was never an ensemble actor."
10,Father,This my father Goodfather. Movie vito corleone by its show. But almost all father good :)
8,Excellent Classic,"Watching this for the first time I was aware of it's reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Although it didn't quite hit that height for me, I can well understand the dedicated following it has.

Charting the story of a mafia family in America, the family's shift of power from father to son, and the family's turbulant relationship with similar power-hungry mafia families, The Godfather is long and at times violent film.

The violence though never seems out of place or thrown in for cinematic kicks - it is justifiably there and actually takes second place overall to excellent character development and dialogue. Equally the film seems to go by much faster than it's 3 hour run time.

A thoroughly enjoyable watch, and one experienced with the feeling of watching a classic piece of cinema."
10,The Best Trilogy Ever! May contain spoilers,"The year is 1945. The Sicilian-American family, the Corleones, is celebrating the wedding of a daughter, Connie, in New York. Everything is going fine...except for the secret meeting held inside the house, a secret meeting on revenge. Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is discussing a problem with a close associate, while his mentor, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) stands on. The Don's three sons are outside celebrating the wedding: Sonny, the hot-tempered oldest brother; Fredo, the shy and quiet middle son; and Michael, the youngest son who has returned from fighting in World War II. Sonny and Fredo are in with the Don's council of 'whacking' people, but Michael refuses to be any part of it, due to total commitment to his girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). However, one day while shopping for food with Fredo, Don Corleone is shot by a betrayal, and is rushed to the hospital. The verdict: An assassination attempt. After hearing this, from Long Beach, California, Michael rushes back home to his father. After hearing about the ones who almost killed the Don, he plots revenge with Sonny and close associates. But a twist of fate happens to the family, and in the end, the once-reluctant Michael is made Don over the Corleones.

Francis Ford Coppola beautifully shows a portrait of what seemed to be a harmless family into such malice. The story was adapted from the number one hit by Mario Puzo, who also collaborated with Coppola in this project. The cinematography is excellent, the screenplay gripping and intelligent, and the haunting but enchanting score is memorable. Marlon Brando is absolutely divine as the ruthless, merciful Don Corleone, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor. New-comer Al Pacino is extremely excellent as Michael, showing both the innocence and fierceness of the son, and his performance received many praises. James Caan is great as scary Sonny, and Robert Duvall could not be a better Tom.

Some notable scenes are the monologue, the Baptism, and the ever-famous horse-head-in-the-bed scene. This demonstrates how scary and malicious the Mob can be. With twists and turns, it shows that even the Mob can lead everyday lives, but one could have a particularly hard time dealing with carrying out a deadly job twenty-four seven.

I personally love this movie, because of the intrigue I felt as I read some of the novel. I definitely recommend this film to people, but I hope that you would not show this to young children. Some things could scar them for life, much like myself...If you like this movie, I also recommend you watch the other two films with the trilogy. In my opinion, this is the greatest trilogy ever made."
10,An ultimate classic!!!,"When you ask people who know about film what they like the most about The Godfather you'll get a fast response: EVERYTHING! It's not the story or the actors or the director or whatever, it's everything together. Everything works out so good, even under the heavy stress Francis Ford Coppola worked with throughout the movie. Maybe that's what makes this movie so great..."
10,Best movie ever made!,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.

The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia."
9,Not Perfekt But Close,What can you say? Coppola got every bit of realism and ability out of the whole cast. They turned themselves inside out. This 3 part saga is definitely in the top 20.
10,The film of the film,"The film of the film, before the ephemeral production, technical marvel (the assembly that the godson of baptism, intersperses the prayer of Michael Corleone with the murders of which he is principal, the exceptional photography, which explores the shadow business of mafia and the light in Michael's relationship with Apollonia, pure and virginal), the force of the cast, the script that interweaves family intrigues with the struggle for power, and the perfection with which Coppola enacts its history. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are memorable, the first as the patriarch who does everything for the family, the second as the odd one who denies the Father and gradually gets involved by the mafia, even to realize that most of the time, the powerful is alone."
3,Very Little To Offer,"Here's how the arguments go for liking this movie go: The Godfather is a great movie because it's a hallmark of the genre. While gangster movies before this had been wall-to-wall violence and only loosely strung together by a plot, The Godfather was able to move away from that tradition by having a plot-heavy mobster movie. The performances were all superb and the characters all felt real.

However, what this argument fails to recognize is that the plot moves at such a slow pace that it's difficult to give a damn about it. This is quite honestly the slowest paced movie I've ever seen, and it would have been improved a thousand-fold if an hour or so had been cut. It's not that I hate slow movies--a slow pacing can work brilliantly--but The Godfather? No, it doesn't do it.

As for the cast and performances, they're really not all they're cracked up to be. If indecipherable mumbling is your thing, so be it, and in that case, this movie is the best thing ever. In reality, though, half-mumbled lines don't really do anything for me, and because of that; all the characters seemed to be fairly one-dimensional as a result.

I can see how you could like this movie. On a technical level, it did move away from the traditional three-point lighting which was common in earlier films, and the plot was definitely something other than what had been dealt with in mobster movies before then. But the content of the plot was somewhat devoid of any real interest--or at least it was for me--and the characters came off as being one-dimensional as a result."
9,A brief evaluation,"""The Godfather"" is a gangster capitalist society about the entire U.S. ground force systems dominate the control group the story of ups and downs in the story, is very vivid characterization."
9,I liked it,Liked it a lot. being is a biy slow but it works i guess.
10,Must watch,Kesin seyredilmesi gereken bir film. Siddetle tavsiye ediyorum. Seri halinde 3 film 10 saatten fazla sürüyor. You must watch this film. Extremly advice.
10,the movie of the age,"The godfather is the most well done movies ever , it shows how the people of the side we dont know about live their lives and how to deal with the huge problems that the may face during their lives, the film well made the sounds ,effects , footage all are amazing !"
10,Greatest crime film ever made,"Man I just don't know where to start. This is hands down the best gangster movie ever made! The most powerful, the most violent, and even the most traumatizing. Al Pacino stars as Michael Corleone, the son of mob boss Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Vito is a very powerful crime boss with a hoarse voice and he decides to one day let his son take control of the family business.

Michael Corleone was in the Marine Corps but he was discharged at some point later in his life. So the first movie of the franchise shows us how innocent Michael appears to be despite his surroundings. Over the course of the movie, we will be introduced to all the members of the Corleone crime family as well as the lawyer who is played by Robert Duvall.

The acting is top notch, it's so great it feels like you're actually right there in the movie experiencing what's right in front of your eyes. Michael's innocence is destroyed as the movie progresses, and he turns insane and becomes vindictive for reasons I won't explain because I don't want to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it yet.

But be warned, The Godfather has lots of very jaw dropping but also shocking moments that can leave you traumatized. You could have some of these scenes stuck in your head for weeks, the movie teaches you a valuable lesson about living a life of crime, especially if you're in a gang or you show interest in the mafia.

There are some memorable quotes in the movie as well like ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli""."
10,The Greatest Movie of All Time!,"The Godfather movie has to be the greatest movie of all time. Al Pacino is the greatest actor of all time. The story takes you through a rollercoaster ride of feelings and raw imagery.

Meagre words can not describe the greatness felt while watching The Godfather... all three of them to be precise."
10,The greatest movie of Hollywood history,The Godfather is one of the best movies I ever watched
1,This movie is Okay,"And somebody has to do something about this hype Honestly bad acting, boring and shallow plot the movie is beeing watched only due to its hype"
8,"""You never think to protect yourself with real friends.""","What needs to be said about Coppola & Puzo's sprawling crime epic? It redefined the language of cinema and permanently altered the pop culture landscape. It is what it is. Rewatching it for the first time as an adult though I found myself suddenly wrapped in these amazingly sharp layers of meaning about crime, the nature of society and the endless back-and-forth of violence and civility. Of course, this was already present, I'd just never seen it properly. I don't necessarily believe that it's dated terribly well, or that every single moment of it is perfectly constructed but that a film this highly lauded and well-trodden is still so gripping and intriguing is testament enough, surely?"
10,Such a wonderful movie,One of the most favorite movie in my life i watched more times.
10,Best!,"For me, it was a difficult film for the first part, so I had to look twice is not that supposed to mean completely, especially the names of the supporting cast. I'm not used to this movie, so I guess you can. A very serious film, it is possible to know a lot of it, and have something to say, of course the family. I think the story is very well found out, it can be a very interesting book, and I think he is funny, because as I watched the film ends, it is based on a book. I definitely Starring Al Pacino came out to be the best, I just wanted to know, first, I think it is fantastic developed here, and the other part as well. Robert Duvall and the other who think it is perfectly formed. Marlon Brando did not work out so much, or so it seemed, but when I watched the second part, really missed it, so I liked it somewhat. The others were good, I think highly of the performances here were the best of the trilogy there. I liked the three parts is virtually the same, only one was slightly better acting performances, but otherwise the same hold good in the other two, do not even think worse. Each of the three great film, but it did not become my favorite, but I will admit that a great, thought-provoking film, and everyone must see at least once. All three films with me 10/9-es osztályzatú here of course is 5 * for they deserve. Those who have not seen, they recommend that you look at it, I'm glad I watched them starting to like more serious movies! ;)"
10,An epic masterpiece,"After having watched the Godfather countless times, I have to say that it is (along with the rest of the trilogy) the best film/series of films I've ever seen. My comments are on the series of films as a whole.

Here are my main reasons for this assertion:

1-The complexity of the plot which draws one in to an involvement with the film without the complexity being just for its own sake.

2-The depth of characterisation of Michael. The way he seems to inevitably to get sucked into something deep and serious when he initially seems ashamed of the family 'business'.

3-The interlinking of scenes from present and past which adds something emotionally at certain points in the film. (eg. the flashback of Michael telling his family about him joining the army)

4-the music which creates an amazing and authentic atmosphere.

parts 1 and 2 merit a 10 and part 3 a 9. (part three is better than some have suggested I think)"
10,Thaime Helen,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on Mario Puzo's novel. It tells the story of the Corleone mafia family, led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), and the transformation of his son Michael (Al Pacino) from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader. With intense storytelling, unforgettable performances, and impeccable atmosphere, the film explores themes of power, loyalty, and corruption. Its music, script, and direction make it a timeless classic. It's a profound story that transcends the gangster genre.

Es muy interesante me gustó mucho la película."
10,like like,"How many times have I seen this movie? I enjoyed so much. This film is very popular in Iran. Although a lot of films have been made in these years, this film is one of the best films of the 1980s"
10,Very cool movie!,"An important place in American history is occupied by a period when several thousand Sicilian immigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life in which there will be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxian Dons. Who knew at that time that this ""pile of Sicilian emigrants"" would take a high place in the United States and in the history of this country."
9,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a timeless classic that has left an indelible mark on the landscape of American cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this film is an epic tale of power, loyalty, and family, woven with intricate storytelling and unforgettable performances.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, bringing a quiet, commanding presence to the screen that has become synonymous with the character. His performance is complemented by a stellar cast, including Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, whose transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless leader is both compelling and tragic.

The film's narrative is rich and layered, exploring the complexities of the Corleone family and their dealings within the criminal underworld. Coppola's direction is masterful, balancing moments of intense drama with quieter, more introspective scenes that delve into the characters' inner lives. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is sharp and engaging, with dialogue that has become etched in cinematic history.

Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a feast for the eyes. Gordon Willis's cinematography captures the era with a dark, moody palette that enhances the film's somber tone. The use of light and shadow is particularly striking, adding depth and nuance to the storytelling. Nino Rota's haunting score further elevates the film, providing an evocative backdrop to the unfolding drama.

While ""The Godfather"" is nearly flawless, it occasionally meanders with its pacing, and some scenes feel drawn out, which might test the patience of modern audiences used to faster-paced narratives. However, these moments are few and far between, and they do little to detract from the film's overall impact.

""The Godfather"" deserves a solid 9 out of 10. It's a film that masterfully combines exceptional performances, a gripping story, and brilliant direction to create a cinematic experience that remains powerful and relevant decades after its release. This is a must-watch for any film enthusiast, a true testament to the art of filmmaking."
10,The Godfather: A Timeless Masterpiece of Cinema,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time. The film's plot follows the Corleone crime family, with particular focus on the patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone, and his son Michael as they navigate their way through the world of organized crime in New York City.

One of the most striking aspects of the film is its ability to blend themes of family, loyalty, power, and corruption in a way that feels both authentic and emotionally resonant. The performances from the cast, particularly Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, are nothing short of phenomenal and have become iconic in the annals of film history.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful and the film's score, composed by Nino Rota, perfectly complements the film's mood and atmosphere. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is also noteworthy, capturing the gritty and realistic feel of New York City and the Corleone family's world.

The film's pacing is also well-done, with each scene building on the previous one to create a sense of tension and uncertainty. The editing is seamless and the dialogue is sharp and memorable.

In short, The Godfather is a film that should not be missed. It is a true classic that has left a lasting impact on cinema and popular culture. The film's themes and performances continue to resonate with audiences today and it's no wonder it is considered one of the greatest films ever made."
10,The Godfather,"What makes Batman different from hero movies is that it makes people feel more about darkness and human nature. Nolan's depiction of the character's personality color and expression of the inner action are incisive and incisive. As for the big scene, it is no less than other hero blockbusters."
10,The Founding Father of the Genre,"There's no need to praise this movie anymore than it has been. Instead, I'd like to bring attention to the relevance it has to the crime genre. When we think of the 'tropes' of the organized crime genre in cinema, a lot of writers and directors pull from this movie franchise. I've even come across the tropes in the Godfather in foreign movies and series about organized crime.

I'd say without a doubt it is the Founding Father of the Genre."
9,favourite,"This is absolutely one of my all time favourites! Its a classic that is worth watching over and over! I watched the entire series of the Godfathers and this was my favourite of them all. The acting, obviously, is amazing with an amazing cast as well. I don't know if i would want to see a modern day remake but i am torn on that lol.

If you haven't seen this then you are missing out. It did however lose some momentum with me as the series went on. That being said i don't think any one of the collection was bad i just felt that the first one was amazing and definitely hard to top. Go see this series now!"
1,Very Overrated,This movie is not as good as it is made out to be and very long. Most of the scenes seem unnecessary and make the movie overly long and boring.
9,This is the kind of movie that reminds me that special effects are overvalued today,"I think this is one of the best mafia movies ever made. It has everything you can ask for: action, nice photography, great direction, suspense, and the best of all: a great plot.

I really wish they made movies like this nowadays. Today most of what you see in the cinemas is filled with special effects but the plot sucks big time. I hope Hollywood will change the way they make cinema today.

What other mafia movies are the big guys making today? none. Why? Because there is not enough money to support the script developers and everything goes into special effects. That sucks. Hope great movies like this will never die."
8,ah well,It's nice but not that great either. I think it was liked by famous actors.
10,Very Good,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well."
10,Prhmorg,"One of the best movie I ever see.

Godfather learned me a lot of things that I don't know before.

This movie always stay in my favourite list.

And also godfather has thousands viewers in iran and have a lot of fans in this country."
9,Perfect,One of the best movies I've watched. Must-see for those who have not watched.
10,"It's Indeed, the Greatest Movie of All Time.","The Godfather is a movie that has truly earned its place in cinematic history. The film is an expertly crafted exploration of the world of organized crime, showcasing the gritty realities of this violent and dangerous world while also delving into the complex relationships between the characters. The acting is top-notch, with Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone being particularly memorable. The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the story and the characters. The music, cinematography, and direction are all masterful, making ""The Godfather"" a movie that is both emotionally intense and intellectually stimulating. In my opinion, this is a film that every cinema lover should experience at least once in their lifetime."
10,"The Godfather: A Masterpiece of Power, Family, and Loyalty",An absolute masterpiece from start to finish honestly one of those movies that just hits different no matter how many times u watch it Al Pacino absolutely killed it in this one watching his character's transformation was insane u literally see him go from this quiet innocent dude to a stone-cold boss and he does it so naturally Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is iconic every scene he's in just feels legendary the presence this man had on screen is unreal The pacing is slow but in a good way it takes its time building characters relationships and tension and it works so well Every scene feels like it matters the dialogue is sharp and smart without ever feeling forced or dramatic for no reason The cinematography and lighting in this movie are beautiful too it captures that old-school classic mafia vibe perfectly and the soundtrack just makes everything hit harder The ending is cold and clean and honestly one of my favorite final scenes ever it leaves u with this heavy feeling like damn that's how it had to go This isn't just a gangster movie it's a story about loyalty family power and how it changes people If u haven't watched it already u gotta fix that asap cause it's a must-see classic that still holds up better than most modern movies today.
10,This is the best,this is the best film for me ! i didn't see film like this ! i hope all see this film before die ! this film make me love movies ! in the paste i didn't love movies like this .. but with this film it make me adore fir movies ! i hope in future we will see some movies like this movie ! we miss movies like this ! when i see this movie i know what mafia mean .. and there is people in mafia have heart and rules and respect ! in the paste i think mafia just people didn't have heart or anything like human .. but this movie change some ideas for me .. i love movies because it's change my mind to the best ! my mind is open now and this movie open my mind for movies cinemas TV shows everything !
3,Still a terrific film !,"The Godfather is still a very enjoyable and strong film, even after more than 30 years. Something that we can't say about a lot of other mafia movies. There is one scene though I find not convincing enough and a bit clumsy, and that is the first scene with Johnny Fontane and the godfather at the beginning of the movie. Now, taking under consideration that Coppola was under a lot of stress during the shooting, because he was threatened to be replaced, the scene doesn't really work as it should in such a flawless masterpiece. Not only do I miss more insight in the relationship of those two men, the camerawork is lost for a minute and I feel it has been build up too much as a set-up for the Woltz scene, which is a mistake."
9,The best movie you can watch,"The most beautiful movie you can watch is about a mafia boss, I can't remember how many times I watched it."
10,Everything is classic.,"This story is so realistic. If I analyze why this movie is a classic, the reason is that this is so realistic as a Mafia movie. It caused by the situation that protagonist started as a university student. He was a normal student like us. We felt our self in his place. And then gradually he is changing so we can follow his heart. In that way, we felt that his behavior is kind of inevitable actions. His is required to do it because he is in the position. His killing people is kind of the mission as of port of the society. It make us feeding fearful. This movie's story is so well written. Especially about the realistic situations. We were shocked by that. But greatest movie couldn't be made by only good story. I think movie is a symphony of music pictures and actors. This is indeed one of the greatest symphonies. Well... what a wonderful movie this is!"
10,Simply Amazing,"Seeing this movie made me take a retrospective look into my values and morals. It made me realize that I have the ability to make the conscience choice of siding with ""good"" or ""evil""."
10,"A Masterpiece of Storytelling, One of the Best Ever Made, Brando Remarkable","The Godfather follows the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American Mafia dynasty, as they navigate the dangerous and complex world of organized crime in New York City. This film has a legendary cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan, and is one of the reasons I consider it to be one of the greatest films of all time.

I've rated the Godfather a 10 out of 10 as it is a masterpiece of storytelling, with a complex and multi-layered narrative that expertly explores themes of power, loyalty, family, and morality. The performances are all exceptional, with Marlon Brando in particular delivering a remarkable performance as the family patriarch, Don Corleone. It's not just the cast its the stylish direction, the memorable score, and the iconic cinematography that also make this film a masterpiece and have all stood the test of time and make the Godfather a must-see film for anyone who loves cinema like I do. Whether you're a fan of crime dramas, historical films, or simply great filmmaking, The Godfather is an undeniable classic that is sure to captivate you."
9,Super flick,"One of the great films of all time. Great characters, actors, directors, producers etc. Loved everything about this film. Must seeeeeeeee for sure!"
10,Well the best way to watch the Godfather is...,"The Best way to watch this movie is to watch it on DVD.

Actually your own DVD.

Not a second hand one if possible...

The reason?

Well... in that way, at least you try to watch it with patience.

I mean after all, you must have spent more than $60, well that's what the boxset costs.

In my case, that helped me enormously.

When I first ordered the boxset on the internet, i was so excited that i am finally going to watch the greatest movie of all time.

Then about 2 weeks later, the DVD arrived.

I waited until the weekend (I am a highschool student ~!) and watched the first Godfather.

My first experience of it was well... disappointing.

It was boring and the story went too slow.

I wasn't just disappointed, I was furious.

Furious about all the good reviews about this movies...

But then with my incredible patience, i watched it again, I mean after all i spent a huge amount of money on this, i had to understand what it was about.

Second time was also bad.

Then i watched it for the thrid time...

And it was....

Incredible....

It was fantasitc.

Suddenly i could see all the meanings of the movies and from then one, i watched it again and again.

I must have watched it more than 10 times now, but I will never get bored...

So Please... if you are watching the Godfather trilogy for the first time and you are young, buy the boxset.

It'll help. Trust me..."
5,perfect,"Really good concept,good acting pro actor and the directing magnificent it is actually really cool for people who love action movies and this is NOT for kids so if your going to watch this tell your son/daughter go sleep XD"
10,Must watch Cinema,"A master piece by Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay is fab. keep inspiring us and new film makers. The story writer put all inputs to bind the audience throughout the film. Cinematography and shots are well designed and executed by the makers. I watched this 5 times, first it was in my syllabus and then i loved it."
9,Amazing Movie !,"This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed."
10,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""","After watching Paramounts original series The Offer how could I not watch The Godfather again.

What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said before. A master class of film making Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duval all give phenomenal performances. Backed up with the great writing of Mario Puzo, along with Francis Ford Coppola's direction makes this film one for the ages.

The greatest film of all time and the first installment in one of the greatest trilogies of all time.

IMDb: 10/10 Letterboxd: 5/5

10,AMAZING,This was amazing! I watched this with my Kids and we loved it.
10,Excellance!!,"One pretty legit movie.I watched this movie so late. I found out something that this film is a base for lot of movies. Marlon Brando's acting is outstanding, his accent man!! got me like this 😐 he killed it. while he saying ""you don't call me godfather"" aha!! god i'm down. Al Pacino he too smashed his acting, still got to watch part 2 and get surprised."
10,The Best,"Great movie! A real class of good values, good conduct and moral. Incredible performance from all the actors.

The best part is when Mike is going to detonate the head of those two guys in the restaurant.

The most sinister part of the movie is when they shoot into the couple's bedroom.

The funniest part is when Sonny throws a few dollars on the floor for the intruder photographer.

It's worth watching again, then come back here and make some more considerations."
9,fiction or reality,"Evil attracts people like a magnet. Wherefore, with movies like this, always earns a lot of money if he is to still acting well equipped. The story, although fictional, describes effective where the greed leads for power and money. Generations kill themselves to get in a short life to power, money and influence. When viewers the baser instincts are addressed. You may find yourself doing that you feel satisfaction when a bad guy kills an even nastier. You can dismiss this as ""Movie"", but in reality everything is worse. What finally remains at the end of life, how early it always ends left? This shows not this movie. Namely a body in a box."
8,Great Performance by Marlon Brando. Overall impressive movie!,"Very interesting characters/character development. Impressive how a Marlon Brando in his 40s could portray a senior so realistically.

A lot of iconic scenes!"
10,The definitive great movie **** (out of ****),"What can I say that hasn't already been said. The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a classic in every sense of the word. Though some may enjoy this film more than others, none can deny its brilliance, and its everlasting appeal as a part of Hollywood legend that divided the industry into sections of old Hollywood (pre-Godfather) and new Hollywood."
10,Greatest ever American drama movie,"From the very first seconds, this film displays a sense of majesty. The performances are spot on - especially Al Pacino & Marlon Brando. The wonderful prolonged wedding scene that opens the film sets a standard for all other film makers. The Godfather theme song is tremendous - the most haunting ever. The interplay between all actors is of the highest standard and the ""look"" of the film is convincing & classy. This film marks the highpoint of American cinema and although films like Good Fellas and Field of Dreams have come close, the general standard of US films since The Godfather has been in gradual decline. Truly a masterpiece."
10,awesome,This is my favorite movie because of only creative shoot.
3,Not for me,Tried many times over and over nothing to do I can't make it trough the whole thing
10,One of the greatest gangster movies in movie history,"The movie tells a romantic gangster epic in a cool and gloomy style. It is one of the greatest gangster movies in the history of film, known as the man's Bible. After 48 years of dramatic changes in the film market, it can still live in everyone's heart. This film not only has made great success in comment, art and box office, but also set a good example for later generations. It is a classic film praised by many people. In this film, the main purpose is not only to tell the story, but also to establish a correct value orientation for the audience."
10,One of the best movies!,"This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen!

Actors are amazing, the story is great, Sicilian accent is also really good! The photography, the lights, the sceneries, the costumes, all really looks very well studied."
10,beyond,"I find this movie compelling and though crime is present in it, you can feel it is not an obscene ... scene. because it is art. i lked Duvall and Brando more. I like it lets us be smart and ,,see,, the traitors. the senes from Italy are amazing."
10,godfather,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."
10,"The Perfect movie, intense experience, doesnt feel like a movie, feels like you are watching real stories unveiled","From the very first moment you just dive into the deep and dark world of the mafia and you just have to admire the acting of Marlon Brando from the very first scene. Although some might be scared to see the length of the movie, but every minute is worth watching. you never feel bored; not for a second. On the other hand you enjoy every second of it. The Al pacino part doesnt really come out in this part. this one is more of a Marlon Brando show. You feel the drama, tragedy, thrill, romace, action, violence all at the same time. truly a masterpiece movie made from a masterpiece epic of a book. No movie fan should miss it."
10,Best movie experience I ever had,"This movie isn't just about mafia or crime or just killing people. Some people thing that this movie is only about violence (mostly female people ;) ). The movie is more about family, how the people in a family are connected together, how a complete innocent son, can become a very violent guy.

It changes the way you look at mafia. Some think that mafia is just a group of gangsters that kill for money. Well, the movie tells you that it's not just that, there is honor. Of course, I'm not saying that they are right, but they aren't just a group of violent assassins. The music on the movie is very well made, the acting is fabulous, and Al Pacino is great. So is Marlon Brando. The movie starts at a good point and ends at a good point too. Some might think that it's not a good ending, doesn't explain enough. But I just love the way in which the movie ends, great music, great scene and great look on Kay's face. I know that there are people who will call this movie a boring one. I accept that it's long...very long, but it's necessary and it explains the entire story very good. Overall, it's a fabulous movie, the best movie experience I ever had. 10/10"
10,Under World Movie,"This Movie nice. its open under world man life. ""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt."
10,Amazing,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. Released in 1972, this film has stood the test of time and remains a benchmark for excellence in filmmaking. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, it tells the engrossing tale of the powerful Corleone crime family, blending intricate storytelling with top-tier performances.

Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the patriarchal head of the family. His portrayal is both subdued and commanding, exuding a quiet power that leaves an indelible mark on the audience. Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, showcases a masterful transformation from a war-hero outsider to a ruthless mafia leader. The cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, all contribute to the film's undeniable gravitas.

The screenplay is nothing short of genius. It intricately weaves themes of loyalty, power, betrayal, and family into a narrative that is as compelling as it is complex. Coppola's direction is meticulous and layered, allowing the story to unfold at a deliberate yet engaging pace. The cinematography by Gordon Willis adds a rich, almost operatic quality to the film, with its use of shadows and light contributing to a sense of impending doom.

Nino Rota's haunting score complements the film perfectly, enhancing the emotional weight of key scenes and contributing to its timeless quality.

What sets ""The Godfather"" apart is its ability to humanize its characters, even as it portrays a world steeped in crime and violence. It tells a universally resonant story about power and its influence on the human condition. The film is also a brilliant exploration of the immigrant experience, showing the lengths to which individuals will go to protect their family and secure their legacy.

""The Godfather"" is more than just a movie; it is an experience, a study in cinematic excellence that has influenced countless films and storytellers. Its meticulous craftsmanship, stellar performances, and profound narrative make it a must-watch for any film enthusiast. Over four decades later, it continues to reign supreme as one of the greatest films ever made.

In closing, ""The Godfather"" is an essential piece of cinema that captures the essence of storytelling at its finest, and its impact will undoubtedly resonate for generations to come."
2,A comedic piece of film,I could not take this movie seriously. If I had watched it without knowing what it was maybe I would have given it some thought but the way the people died was so funny to me.
10,Master Piece,"I recently watched The God Father for the second time, the first time was during my childhood and the last time was after working for more than a decade in the filmmaking industry. I can strongly say that I am impressed with its tone, storyline and actors performance. I was astonished when I knew that it's the first acting experience for Al Pacino on screen adding to this the quiet outstanding performance for Marlon Brando. You can easily fall in love with the characters although you know they are killers and drug dealers. The family aspect in the characters are so real and genuine.

Despite it's a slow based story but you can't leave the screen or get your eyes out of it."

10,Easily one of my favourite films of all time.,"I recently watched this film for the first time with my father. It was his choice, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy it nearly as much as I did!

Marlon Brando was an absolutely sublime Vito. Vito Corleone is possibly one of my all-time favourite fictional characters now.

I'm not an expert review-writer, but I just want to say that this film is unarguably one of the best films ever made, if not the best, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
10,"Amazing, Spectacular, Flawless!","Although I watched the movie a logn time ago, it is just unforgettable! From directing to acting, the film is a diamond!"
9,Perfect,"Don't hate your enemy, it will affect your judgment."
10,Awesome performances!,"With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless."
5,Celebration of organized crime,"The 3 movies represent over 9 hours of celebrating a mass murderer and a corporate criminal who is too street-smart always gets away with it.

Good actors, excellent director, but the script is abominable."
10,best mafia movie ever made,I really adore this type of movies and i watched a lot of them but the godfather movie is an exception its soo much different how they build the characters the environment the story and the most amazing thing was the dialogue its just so great i cant even expect any movie in this period to compete with this piece of art
10,Best film,"In my opinion ""The Godfather"" is, in every way, the best film ever made."
9,A True Pioneer,"This movie is a pioneer to so many that have come after it. It paved the way like few have done before.

Definitely a slow burn, but that's partly what makes it so good. The build up, several scenes are thrilling, leaving your heart pounding, needing to know what's going to happen and how it's going to play out. It doesn't rely on constant, needless, high-speed action. Something almost impossible to do for a 3 hour runtime. Instead, the slow progression of a character's transformation. It's a beautiful thing that few get right, but The Godfather absolutely nails it.

Everything simply just ""works"", from the story, casting, themes, cinematography, music, etc. So many aspects come together to make one extraordinary, poetic film. That's how and why this film still holds up after nearly 50 years."
10,Best movie in the history,"Al-pacino had reach the highest level of actoring, and"
10,We got it wrong,"All the fan of the godfather trilogy got it wrong. This is not a story about the mafia or gangster or tough guys. This is a story about family. This a story about a youngest son of the family taking things in his own hand so that he can take care of his family. For that , he will do anything that is necessary."
10,God Father Only,"God Father with all parts is really the Only and excellent movie of all the time about tough criminal world. It is one those movies when no matter of the part of the movie characters stay the same - that makes it like One Big Pciture. It's the one you gonna watch over and over, repeating the best moments.The film's famous score was composed by Nino Rota. Francis Coppola's father Carmine Coppola contributed to the music performed in the film's wedding scene.[28] Later, his son would call on him to compose additional music for the score of The Godfather Part II (1974) and most of the score for The Godfather Part III (1990) Love this movie!

10,Milestone in History,"This movie is one of the milestones of movie industry and one that considered a real art from all aspects. it is a must for any person and will be for the coming 50 years at least, The cast, writer, producer and director, all did a perfect job, resulting in this master piece of a movie. I recommend this for any one with all three parts, without any hesitation."
10,Great movie,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line."
4,It's Fine,"Finish watching it today, I expect too much because of the reviews they say that this is the best and greatest movie ever but when i watch it it's good and watchable maybe it's just not my type of movie. But still It's fine to me, not too bad and not too good, the action and killings is brutal. FOR ME not the best movie but not the worst."
10,Best of mafia movie,You must watch this masterpiece. Absolutely watch...

9,memories,Many people have memories with this film. It is said that many of the action genre films that are being made today are actually inspired by this wonderful film.
10,"A movie could be called ""bible of male""","The film is stunningly good, gripping and entertaining. It shows a superb shooting technique, so that each character is molded into a three-dimensional image. This movie could be called ""man's bible"". The charm of the godfather is unique in that all the interests exchanged and the right family values and the love for friends allow you to see yourself again from your own world view. It is a far-reaching romantic epic gangster movie."
10,A masterpiece of the last century,"The film ""The Godfather"" is literally the father of this film industry. Many great directors were inspired by him, creating their masterpieces. Yes, indeed, to this day one can find references to such a famous and glorified painting. If they ask me what a classic is, then I will answer - it is ""The Godfather"". The film drew me in from the very first minutes, immersing me in the heart of Italian culture, and more importantly, in the main event at the beginning of the story - the wedding of Vito Corleone's daughter. Very rarely do I watch movies so enthusiastically, so I will never be able to forget all the main characters, I will not be able to forget the way of life that was present in their lives, even if it was far from a simple modern man in the street like me."
10,The movie that made me love movies,The Godfather is the one movie that I can say as a kid...I want to do that when i grow up!
3,Not what I taught,Couldn't stay awake after 3rd time trying to watch it
10,Worth of all the praise,"This picture is totally worth of all the praise it receives, impeccable acting from all the involved, excelent storyline and filmmaking, i am not sure if it is a good adaptation of the original novel written by Mario Puzo, for anyone that wants to watch it: i recommend Also seeing the 2 sequels, they really help this one. I know some people may find it boring because of it's extended runtime, but in My personal opinión every minutes of this picture is totally worth it, Also, i know i mentioned it before but the score and the main theme are absolutely unforgetable and excelente. This movie is truly a Masterpiece."

10,"Brando, Brando, Brando!","What can one say?

The plot of The Godfather is legend. The classic scenes and moments never stop coming at you. With such a gallery of great and interesting characters, how can they not? And then you have the brilliance of the cast to make it all possible. And yet through all this. The moments, adventure and excitement, Marlon Brando still manages to shine far beyond the rest of the cast.

Judi Dench won one of those golden men for Best Supporting Actress after only 8 minutes of screen time. Well, Marlon won the big one after limited playing time in The Godfather, a movie that lasts for nearly three hours.

When you think about how he still owns this film, it's close to scary. He haunts th screen, his presence is always being felt, he's always in the back of the heads of the other characters.

Why? Because of greatness. Because he is the symbol, he is the reason why we think of the word Godfather in an entirely different way."
10,Must See Classic,"Such a classic, I watch it over and over and I find more things I missed the last time."
10,Masterpiece!!!!! This is the best crime movie I ever saw after Scarface,This is the best crime movie after Scarface. The character are very iconic and al Pacino and Marlon Brando did a awesome acting.

Pros:



Cons:



(See. For Me That's The Beauty of It. Every Time You Watch it You Learn Something, but I understand Some People That Only Watch Films Only Once)

Rating On Each Aspect"
10,This movie is Amazing!!,"Watching this as a kid changed me. I wanted to be a mobster for a while. Cool suits, women and money?! Of Course but once I got older I understood that was a dangerous life but still admired these guys because yes it was a movie but it was someone's real life also. Almost a bio pic if you will. Amazing movie about the mob, loyal, money, power, family & Respect. The Godfather is one of those all time classics. It almost timeless. This movie was the start of it all. It was eye opening to see how mobsters operated, and the crazy life they lived. I believe this movie is the closest to the real thing you can get."
10,"Masterpiece, Greatest drama crime movie ever made👌","Amazing script, flawless from the opening scene to the end, great development of personalities, epic performance for Alpacino and Marlon Brando ,you gotta love the italian gangster after this movie One of Coppola's finest art"
10,"great, perfect","It's a very creative movie based on a great novel it was beautiful all the acting, the directing it fully deserves to be the greatest of all time."
10,IMPORTANT.,"I can't believe I've lived so long without watching this. It uses every frame of its time to humanize then destroy a family, making their trade and income unimportant, and changing the world of film in the process. One of the best ever, period."
10,Best Movie I Ever Watched,"The Story Ploting and the actors were awesome, these movie just killed it. The main charachter of this movie exlained the mafia world and how they really behave in the real world. And the familes shown in the mafia world plus how they protect there family and friends and how they take revenge and how they have control on politics are real in this world. They some how control countries and there economy to they really work with goverment and work like bussiness man. The god father is just as a mirror to mafia world and this movie director has made us show all credits to him and he is a GOAT in Hollywood."
8,it good,It good movie me likey veri good yes i like likey much good songs good story good everything very movie long movie bacon eggs cheese
9,Solid work and atmosphere,Always been in love with the atmosphere of these movies! Perfection!
1,Sets a very bad example,"Such a boring movie. I'm a very well established psychiatrist and I was disgusted and bewildered by the lack of care the characters had for themselves in this film. What on earth was Michael Corleone doing not taking antidepressants?! Michael was a very depressed character and the fact he didn't seem to take any antidepressants in this film baffles me as I thought that would've been obvious for him to do.

Antidepressants may be undertested a lot and may frequently make people infertile but it's totally worth it if it means stopping a potential suicide of someone like Michael. I'm disgusted with this movie and my heart ached for the Autistic man known as Michael Corleone to get help and good drugs from a pharmacy in this movie."
10,All time favourite classic,I love this move. The scene with the horse head is one of the strongest movie moments ever. I love the directing and the acting.
9,Coppola's Way,"The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family.""

It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.

I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended."
10,The Godfather is a Brilliant film!!!,"Marlon Brando is the head of the Corleone crime family. He is a family man, he is a loving man, and will protect his family at all cost. Even though the choices he makes to protect them puts HIM in much danger. After refusing to get involved in the dangerous drug business. The drug men try to kill him. He is helpless in the hospital. His sons take control of the family and they protect the family. His youngest son, who refused to get involve with his fathers business, takes the honors of retaliating against the people who tried to kill his father. Which changes the life of everyone in the family...And mostly him...Forever... What a Brilliant motion picture!"
10,Here's a review of The Godfather,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is widely considered one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1972, the movie is a sprawling saga of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan in New York City.

The story centers around Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging patriarch of the family, and his youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). Michael, a decorated war hero, initially tries to distance himself from the family business. However, he's drawn into the world of organized crime after an attempt is made on his father's life.

The Godfather is a complex and morally ambiguous film. It doesn't shy away from the violence and brutality of the Mafia, but it also portrays the Corleones with a sense of loyalty and tradition. The film's central theme is the corruption of power, and how even good people can be drawn into darkness.

Here are some of the film's strengths:

Superb acting: Brando and Pacino deliver iconic performances, with Brando's raspy-voiced Don Corleone and Pacino's transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless killer.

Gripping story: The Godfather is a masterfully crafted narrative that keeps you hooked from beginning to end.

Cinematography: The film's visuals are stunning, with memorable shots like the baptism scene intercut with violence.

Score: Nino Rota's haunting score is an essential part of the film's atmosphere.

The Godfather is a must-watch for any film fan. It's a complex and thought-provoking film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. However, it's important to note that it does contain violence and profanity.

Here are some additional points to consider depending on your audience:

The film has been praised for its realistic portrayal of the Mafia, but it has also been criticized for glamorizing organized crime.

The film is quite long, at over two and a half hours.

The violence in the film can be graphic and disturbing.

Overall, The Godfather is a landmark film that deserves its classic status. It's a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power."
5,best one,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference."
10,My thoughts,"I personally thought that all the Godfather Movies were excellent, It depicts actual events that took place in the time of the Mobster!! I have to say it never pays to have a hot head, and can't think right, as seen in some of these movies, but rather use your brain and then think out your strategies."
10,An undeniable classic.,"There's no question this film will be considered a classic a century from now. One can only hope that an actor is born that will surpass Marlon Brando as the Godfather, or that a film that equally captures the American spirit will be made over the next 100 years."
8,Masterpiece,This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
5,Present year 2025,"I like the Godfather because of the actor Al Pacino, like me with glasses it's hard to edit the story, in this days and ages with AIs supporting you, you can quickly fill in the question because it disappears when weak. I was staring at the clothes they were wearing in the old days and there were many layers of women. Like me, what I want in the story is how the actor plays his role, I focus on the face, clothes, car and place because the time is -1972. Right now you have to control yourself that the movie you are watching is not violent, don't watch everything if there is violence to be seen."
10,a masterpiece,"One of the most perfect movies ever made. In amazes me when people think this is about organized crime,la cosa nostra,or the Mafia.it's not. I think it's one of the most accurate coming-of-age movie I've ever seen, not necessarily for the whole family, but in my own opinion a prerequisite for every American."
10,What a Film!,Best of the best! You can't find anything like this.
10,The Godfather is Flawless!,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and AI Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoit."
9,best movie,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.

The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, ""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse"" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."
10,IMDB TOP 100,"Wow this movie was really that great, i hope for who doesnt watch this film you must watch this movie. The cast, character all was great. Many good scenes you can see from this movie. Al pacino, robert de niro there acting was really awesome until now i havent seen bad reviews from this movie."
10,The taste of a film,"A film that brings us the fullness of the time. When I watched it for the first time, it was as if I was visualizing a time, a family, a veritable simplicity in the details of each word of the actors. I always like to review it for feeling these things. You can even smell the blood!"
10,The Don of all movies,"It is widely known that 'The Godfather' is one of the five or ten greatest movies ever conceived. About three months ago, it celebrated its 50th anniversary, and was beautifully restored by a group of immensely talented people. I saw the film at a special screening at the Paramount lot theater, and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had watching a movie. Not only was I illuminated and electrified by the masterpiece up there on the screen, but I was also admiring how great the movie both looked and felt. I had always known that the film had become grainy, and even the first time I saw it I could tell. The restoration makes it look just about flawless.

It's a flawless movie, a life changing movie, a film changing movie... it's a movie with composure that Coppola hasn't lived up to since, or for that matter, I don't think any director has since. Coppola's direction is so precise, concise, efficient, lean and organized, and has beautifully intertwined pacing. If it's not the best movie I've ever seen, then it's certainly the most beautifully choreographed, wonderfully paced I've ever seen.

The beautifully constructed and rich plot follows Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Don of a postwar organized crime family, who's getting older and older. After a series of complicated events, his leadership shifts to the youngest of the family, Michael (Al Pacino). At first, Michael is hesitant to break into such brooding and dark territory, but slowly transforms into somebody that he thought he'd never be. The cast also includes James Caan, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, and Lenny Montana.

Every sequence is designed with such passion and craft that it is hard to not be completely sucked in. My favorite scenes are the wedding sequence at the beginning, which Coppola intertwines with meetings with the Don, and the scenes with Capt. McCluskey, a corrupt police captain, eating dinner with Michael. I will not spoil anything. I think this is a film that everybody must see. It is an element of modern art; little has achieved such a high status. It's unquestionably a masterpiece, and a movie that brought American popular entertainment to the ranks of the foreign masters. It was a joy to see it again and absorb so much.

It's probably the best movie I've ever seen.

The Godfather (1972)

4 STARS (OUT OF 4)

175 minutes."
10,An absolute masterpiece. Epic,"So just like the reason I joined Metacritic, once I seen there actually negative reviews for The Godfather on here I just had to sign up.

For anyone who has yet to see The Godfather, please do not believe any 'review' that gives this classic any less than 9/10. The negative reviews on here are laughable; one in particular by Revan is pathetic. Anyone who is stupid enough to genuinely think The Godfather is not a great movie has no idea what makes a good film what so ever.

The Godfather is near perfection; the most important aspect of any movie has to be the acting itself, which in the Godfather will blow you away. Featuring the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando, in one of best ever performances. The rest of the cast are almost as impressive with absolutely no weak performances at all.

The story is superb and totally compelling and its just one of those films that is so good you just do not want it to end. I actually envy people who have not seen it in a way, as that first time is the best.

Without any shadow of a doubt, the greatest gangster movie of all time, and probably the best movie of all time as well. Amazing"
10,As close to a perfect movie as there's ever been,"This one has it all. The casting, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the plot twists. It is simply almost above reproach. Many say GFII is the better movie, but because it tells 2 stories instead of one, my nod goes to the original Godfather."
10,just i can say great enough,I think this film one of my exciting films that i seen before. The main idea of this film was great. I saw this film 3 times in one day and it blows me away .I saw all the works of this director .the story was so lovely.I can remember it all day and i think about it a lot.that was flawless.
10,Best movie ever made,This movie was a masterpiece. Every scene is a piece of history. Coppola had put so much work on this and it is still today the best movie ever
10,Cinematic Beauty,"How is it possible for a gangster film to bring a tear to one's eye?

I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film, although every time it leaves me overwhelmed. The first thing which makes this film, for me, is the music; its genuine authenticity, being scored by a genuine Italian maestro, is unmistakable which, together with its stunning cinematography, gives the film its true and honest character. Beyond this, the storyline is excellent, although it does help to watch the film more than once given the extensive character list. On top of this, the cast is simply outstanding, each perfectly suited and giving clear distinction and definition to their character and each delivering a performance which they have surely not surpassed in their respective careers. It is easy to single out Pacino, Brando and Caan as the standout performances, each of which are excellent, however the supporting roles are equally impressive and go beyond support, sharing the intricacies of each character, their inter- relationships and their moral struggles in the face of organised crime and family values.

Without wanting to give anything away, the closing scene is, in my opinion, one of the best moments in cinema.

Quite simply, this is not a ""gangster film"". It is a masterpiece which needs no categorisation, it needs just to be enjoyed."
10,Visually Imppecable and fundementally one of the best films!,"I actually have never seen the classic movie and was really impressed and understand why it holds the status that it does in American Cinema. The locations and set were beautiful and spot on with the theme. I thought everybody looked like they belonged perfectly. The legendary scene with Don Corleone where he is in his office on the day of his daughter's wedding. The lighting and shadows in that is really impressive. Another one of my favorites that show how a movie can take you on a journey. Forget about what's going on for a couple of hours. When Michael was in the bathroom of the restaurant and the train was passing by and you see him searching for his pistol. I think this is a great example of great cinematography, acting and writing all coming together to create a larger than life scene. Being in a theatre it emphasized everything by a ton. You could hear the train as if you are sitting in that restaurant. Notice all the lighting and shadows I was really impressed!"
9,Godfather Series,This was a great beginning to a timeless film. A master piece in and ahead of its time.
9,Everything!,"Thank you to the great director for making the masterpiece of history in which family relationships show us how the brother behaves with his siblings and his parents, and how they behave differently, how to keep their family identity, that smuggling has caused Destruction of a man, Convicted treason, Filled with persistent and meaningful dialogues, And much more ...."
10,All time favorites,"Love this movie, It will always be one of my all time favorites and the style will always be a huge inspiration to me."
1,"All that is WRONG with America, is this film","If you want a portrait of all that is wrong with America, look not only at this film but the fact that so many people have immortilized this overrated, grossly violent movie with no redeeming qualities. This shouldn't even be top 1000. It's boring, WAY too long and has terrible story writing and pacing. Who the hell loves this atrocity???"
9,A must watch movie,The perfect movie. Every role is played well. The story is awesome.
10,Flawless movie,Will watch it over and over again and won't get tired
10,Classic,The best movie of all time. Unforgettable catch phrases. Unforgettable role playing. Simply unforgettable. Marlon Brando is the all-time greatest godfather who ever was. Al Pacino's first big hit movie is a triumph. I loved the movie because of decision making and full of frustration and suspense. Excellent.
10,Damn good,"Truly the best movie of all time, except for perhaps Part II. Marlon Brando is unforgettable. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone- probably one of the better performances on film. Ever. The cinematography is gorgeous. The end comes together very nicely, though the loss of Michael's innocence through his first hit is heartbreaking."
10,The pinnacle of American film. Undoubtedly a masterpiece.,"You may be wondering what all the fuss is about. Allow me to explain. What we have here in The Godfather is a film that is flawless in mostly every area. A film so deeply ingrained in our pop-culture that we aware of it without a direct mention. It takes a rich, deep, and intimate narrative; mixes it with stunning performances from a brilliant cast; adds the startling and intense direction of Francis Ford Coppola, and finishes it all off with an array of imagery and dialogue that is imbued in every film lovers' mind.

It is immaculately paced, rewarding, and allows you to take something new from it every time you see it. This is everything a film should be. Go watch it."
10,Perfect Movie,"The Godfather is one of the most famous movies ever made. People can quote the lines, they know the theme song. It's a perfect movie. The story is based on Mario Puzo's terrific novel and the cast is wonderful led by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. A true classic.

This is just a great movie. There is not one bad thing I could say about it. It's because of movies like this that I'm so passionate about movies. If you haven't seen The Godfather as well as Parts II & III you're missing out on something special."
10,a legendary masterpiece,"Unquestionably the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema! An saga about power, family, love, hate, business, in other words, about life itself. A rare example of a book adaptation. The movie, which inspired many projects, was able to stand upright despite the difficulties it went through during its production and brought endless fame to its creators. Especially the legendary acting of Marlon Brando as the Godfather and the choices he made for the role gave the movie a completely different dimension. Al Pacino's calm but stormy gaze, Sonny's brutality, the trust of his beloved Consiglieri and, above all, the ruthlessness of life and the mafia are beautifully portrayed."
10,A movie about men,"To man: don't remember to hate your opponent, it will make you lose your mind."
10,Masterpiece of A Family Life,"The film, despite being a masterpiece that has persisted throughout history, has managed to maintain its position at the summit for me, both up to now and in the future. Reflecting a family life in a dramatic way that anyone, regardless of age, can easily empathize with, this work achieves a unique success without compromising on realism. With its deeply poignant meanings that send shivers down the spine, it not only pulls the audience into a captivating story but also succeeds in touching universal emotions. The film stands out not only as a tribute to the past but also as an inspiration for the future. While each scene harbors a separate story, it invites the audience on an emotional adventure. This unparalleled work goes beyond art, offering an experience that delves into profound thoughts, leaving an unforgettable impact on its viewers."
8,Its fine. But I am little dissappointed,"This is second highest rated movie of all the time. I had a lot expectations but its not upto the mark. First half of the movie is not that interesting. I am sorry if this makes an offense to the fans. In second half, when Mike takes over, things get interesting but story ends suddenly. Hopefully, for the next part of the movie.

Current days, other Don movies like El Chapo are more interesting and thrilling as compared. I have rated it provided the time of its release and for the story."
10,Best Movie,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.

For me this movie best movie i see it ."
10,Number 1 movie of all time,"Its the best gangster movie you can watch.

Also you need to watch the Godfather 2 and 3 to understand the full story.

After watching this movie you probable wanna watch American Gangster its also amazing."
10,The BEST!!!,"By far, the best movie that I have ever seen (and that's saying a lot)... The acting, the story, the action, the family, everything!!!

Al Pacino gives us the best performance the screen has ever seen... Watching his transformation through the three films is simply amazing... Brando, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Cazale are all outstanding as well...

The Best... period..."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece: The Godfather,"This is one of my My favourate movies. I have watched for many times. I still remember the fist time.

Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has captivated audiences for decades. This epic crime drama delves into the intricate world of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan led by the enigmatic Don Vito Corleone.

The film masterfully portrays the rise and fall of the Corleone family through the eyes of its youngest son, Michael Corleone. As Michael reluctantly becomes embroiled in the family business, he undergoes a transformation from a war hero to a ruthless crime lord.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its complex characters. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone is a tour de force, showcasing the character's wisdom, power, and unwavering loyalty. Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone is equally compelling, capturing the character's gradual descent into darkness.

The Godfather is not just a gangster film; it's a profound exploration of family, power, and the corrupting influence of organized crime. The film's meticulous attention to detail, stunning cinematography, and unforgettable score create a truly immersive cinematic experience.

Whether you're a seasoned film buff or a newcomer to the world of cinema, The Godfather is a must-watch. Its enduring legacy is a testament to its timeless storytelling and powerful performances."
10,great movie!,"Ts my first ever movie iam watching with a huge mob fro my college the experience about this movie is not able to complete by few wprds or sentenses, this is the milestone of my movie watching, i still adore amd like such types of classic hits!each scenes worthful for the audiece."
9,"A classic, and one of the best movies ever made.","The Godfather is a movie that will stand the test of time as one of the best movies ever made. It had one of the best group of actors ever assembled, and the performances they gave were top notch.

The pacing was very good; slow where it needed to be, and fast when appropriate. Nothing was out of place, and no line ever felt out of place.

The story was a brilliant one, and not once, despite all the characters involved, did it ever become confusing or boring. The story sped through the years and kept you in suspense as to what would happen the whole time.

All in all, this a movie that anyone should see who is over the age of 15. It has stood the test of time, and is still considered by many to be the greatest movie of all time. And this is for a very good reason."
10,Epic and Classic Movie,Brilliant screenplay backed with awesome character development and Wonderful Acting by Marlon Brando
8,REVIEW,"It's extremely good and fantastic. It is a gangster film, or maybe an outstanding family portrait , every part conect together, really worth to see"
10,legend movie,I love the 2nd Godfather the writer of of this movie is in he/her time zone
10,classic of all time,Like most classic pieces of art - time reveals all flaws -- and this film shines bright after all these years. Pure gold!
10,The best ever,"The best movie ever made in my opinion, a pure classic with legendary actors in it! Must watch if you haven't."
8,Memories,One of my brothers all times favourite. Classic. I dont remember much about it but cinema was way different than what is now. Movies with such intensity and character are jewels of history.
5,Masterpiece,All time's great!!!! This movie is beyond everything 1972 the golden era of world cinema.
10,Mastrpiece,As the reviews show! This movie truly is a gem! Al Pacino took it to another level!
10,Timeless,A truly iconic epic movie. A must watch for fans of cinema.
8,The Godfather is an Experience!!,"God father is the movie of definition for Gangster stories!

It doesn't matter What business you are involving, but Every man has to take care of his family at all times. There should be principle in your business and don't ever violate the limits which you set up. Let your actions speak for you. Like Godfather, Give them offers that the cant refuse!!

I can feel the background music still when i am remember this film. Wonderful background score and almost all the characters were well played by the artists. What negative i could say is the length of the film. When i finish watching the film, its kind of feeling that i have lived in Sicily, America and all the locations the films was traveling.. I am a fan of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino after watching this movie.

Overall The Godfather is not only a Movie but Its an Experience!! DO watch it and feel it!!"
10,Cinematic Storytelling at Its Best,"It's among the most famous, celebrated, parodied and influential films ever made. Adapted from the book by Mario Puzo, this is a clear demonstration of the fact that film adaptations do not have to be the poor relation of the original novel. For the few who may not have seen it, the film is centred around two characters: firstly, there's Don Corleone, a man of power and influence who exists in the penumbra of crime and respectability. He is ruthless but also humane, powerful yet vulnerable, wise and simultaneously stubborn. He is charged with taking care of his ""family"", including blood relations and his wider organisation, which is built on the Sicilian model of organised crime. In order to maintain his position of influence in a shifting and complicated political landscape, he must be judicious in his decision-making, picking his battles as appropriate and channelling his resources as prudent. Then there is his youngest son: Michael Corleone. Initially he wishes to have no involvement in the family business; he wants to be a fully-fledged American and to let go of the murky ties to his Sicilian heritage and its connection with clandestine murder and violence. He serves in the army during WW2 and is decorated for his service. But, as his father starts to lose his grip on power and the Corleone family find themselves thrust into severe peril, the duty falls to him to step into the centre of events. He demonstrated his heroism for his country, now he must do the same for his family. The question is, at what cost to himself and the wholesome American life that he had been on the verge of building?

This film is an absolute marvel in story-telling. In Michael Corleone, it essentially takes the mold of the hero's journey with a character beginning in inauspicious circumstances, from the perspective of the mafia world in which he finds himself embroiled, to facing test after test which will prove his valour, strength, will and determination. His fate is partially foreshadowed by his father, however. Uneasy is the head that wears a crown, there is great responsibility and sacrifice which comes with power and influence and the trajectory of both central characters' journeys are demonstrations of this. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is gloriously atmospheric, the supporting cast are all exceptional and make the film a rich, profoundly engaging spectacle. The acting by two of the greatest film actors there ever were: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, is sheer magic to behold and Coppola pulls the strings of Puzo's narrative beautifully, creating an epic that is one of the films which defines cinema to this day."
10,Godfather,"This film is nothing short of a masterpiece! The writing is amazing, and the directing is top notch. This film has inspired hundreds of filmmakers around the world. The Godfather has an outstanding cast and the script has impressive dialogue. This film is entertaining from start to finish. Francis Coppola's imagination & vision is laser sharp. I will always keep this film in my movie collection. A must have for every movie lover. I could watch this film over and over again and never get bored because it's just that great. I enjoy the acting and the score to this film. A classic soundtrack with amazing sound."
2,k,"Seem pretty boring for me want my type, plus its an old movie"
10,Truly amazing,"This movie is so great, it has excellent acting, directing, screenplay, and the reality of the whole thing, the actors didn't look like actors the actors looked like real people.

However this film would be found at a movie store in under the Crime section, everybody knows that it is a film about family. one of the most dramatic films (that I liked) that I have ever seen and the best too

10/10"
10,I MADE HIM AN OFFER HE COULDN'T REFUSE...,Great Movie of all time very Fabulous acting dialogues. Awesome best crime drama i loved it.....
9,The GodFather Review,"""The Godfather"" is a classic movie that will have you in stitches... from laughter! This film is a true testament to the comedic talents of Marlon Brando, who absolutely steals the show as the lovable gangster, Vito Corleone. From his over-the-top facial expressions to his hilarious one-liners, you won't be able to stop giggling.

But it's not just Brando who will have you in stitches. The supporting cast is full of hilarious characters, including the bumbling and often confused Tom Hagen, the unpredictable and hot-headed Sonny, and the comically evil Sollozzo.

The film's script is also full of comedic gold, with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse... to join the clown college"" and ""Leave the gun. Take the cannolis.""

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a film that will have you laughing out loud and rethinking your stance on organized crime. Don't miss it!"
10,Masterpiece!,"Excellent story, a perfect scenario. Great actors and director has made the movie a masterpiece. This is a film that does not leave you indifferent after watching. For a long time I had to force myself to watch this movie. I now regret that I did not saw it before because I didn't started in time to appreciate the Al Pacino acting and Francis Copolla work. And of course, it is needless to mention the excellent work of Marlon Brando. This movie makes you to fall in love with New York in the 1920s, and to wish that you were born in that time. This is one of those rare movies whose II and III part are not ruininig the whole story and the overall impression of the film. The second and third sequel even more complete story. In addition to the excellent story and acting, and you will enjoy the artistic dimension of this masterpiece."
10,A brilliant begin of beautiful saga.,"The reason why I value this movie so high, is because of the brilliant casting of its players. Especially the young and not yet well-known Al Pacino. The director Coppola insisted that Al Pacino would play Micheal while the production company wanted someone else. The great pressure on Al Pacino to proof himself as a worthy actor is perfectly seen during the entire movie. Its seems that Pacino has a lack of self confidence which fits the exactly the type of character he has to play. In The Godfather 3 you see an entire different Al Pacino. His qualities are already well known and thus there's no need to proof himself anymore.

Also the role played by Duvall as Hagen is beautiful and is really missed in the third part."
8,A fully-fledged work,"The Godfather (1978) is a remarkable film for its time and even now, and while it can be a bit boring, if you have a mature mind and patience, you can witness a masterpiece, to the point that I watched the second part immediately after finishing the first part. This masterpiece starring Mr. Brando and Al Pacino is one of those films that can give you a deep and unique experience of a mafia movie. Most of the negative comments are about the boringness of the full version of the film, but you just have to be a little patient or not force yourself to watch the boring part of the film. In my opinion, for a deeper experience, it is better to be patient and watch the film in its entirety if you can."
10,After Thoughts,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the Godfather. It's a masterpiece that is perfect in every way. The casting is perfect, the score is perfect, the story is perfect! It's a perfect movie! This was the first mafia/organized crime film I ever saw. I was 10 and was completely stary eyed when I finished it for the first time. Being from a long line of Italians, the personal mannerism they use in thier day to day life is perfect and authentic. And every actor in this movie acted so so good. If I could I would give an Oscar to every person in this film. If you are not convinced to watch and love the Godfather by all the other reviews I don't know what else I can say to change your mind."
10,The GODFATHER of film,"It isn't often that a Hollywood film masterpiece is achieved.

This is one of those very rare occasions.

For those who want a short and to-the-point review: This is an excellent story telling event about an Italian Mafia family from the mid 1940s to the mid 1950s centring on the (fictional) Corleone Family headed by Vitto and eventually super-ceded by his youngest son Michael.

For those who care to read on: this is a film based very firmly around Mario Puzio's book of the same name. To put it simply: the story is well crafted, the characters are given definition, the actors have given themselves to the roles they have been so fortunate to play and the direction is so pure that it seems effortless and almost transcends time - which is incredibly improbable to achieve when filming a period piece.

This film will outlive any of the garbage we seem to accept on daily/weekly/monthly and annual basis.

It may not be your go-to whenever you need to watch something but it will expand your understanding on what serious film making is about. Take your time in experiencing this journey."
10,Best movie ever !,This is the best movie i ever seen in my life ! It is simply a great movie with great actors and great director

Sitting here with my overexpensive, 4K box, which tells me in big letters that this is the 50th anniversary for the greatest movie ever made, make me feel old. It was made the year before I was born, and I first saw it in... 1982, 9 years old, with my dad. I didn't get much of the story, but got hypnotized by the awesome beginning with Brando's speech and the wedding. My lifelong obsession as a film geek was truly lit. There's something really special about it, that other movies lacks. Some critics says it glamorishes the mafia. Don't agree at all. It's a movie about family, and in glimpses we see the power and violence Vito Corleone possesses. And if anyone thinks it glamorises the mob, they are beyond stupid. It anything, the trilogy tells about the corruption of the human soul, when Michael Corleone goes full in to be the next Don, with some incredible violent scenes edited into the bapthism of Michael's own godson. He sold his soul, but he doesnt care. It's beautiful told, because Coppolla happens to be a great director, with incredible actors around. Seems I'm in minority thinking the 1st is the best. Mostly because it's ""my precious favorite"", but Part II has a bit to much politics that doesnt involve The Corleone's directly, so I will always find it ""inferiour"". It's a great, great movie, none the less. Now I'm looking forward to finally see the revised The Godfather Part III in full 4K. Maybe I will finally embrace it as a part of a great trilogy?"
9,Oh Those Corleones,"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.

And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.

Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.

Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.

Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.

Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).

Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.

My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"

9,"Of course, The Godfather film is one of the greatest movies ever made, right?","Originally there were a lot of objections from some people who didn't like the violence in the movie. Despite all objections, the movie still dazzled and glittered a new beginning of the American cinema."
10,One of the best films of all time.,"The film, the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, is one of the most accomplished film creations of all time. It is not only the montage of the same, also the plot, costume, interpretation of the actors, and the intrinsic message that contains. The film is timeless, it does not matter in the year that was made, because at any time is a reference of a well-done story and good cinema. The subject of the mafia always intrigues, everyone wants to know about it regardless of what they consider, whether it is good or bad, because they are well-planned organizations in which discipline, and respect for the word do functional. The godfather collects all these elements, jointly by the love for the family, and not only the family of the home, but family is the whole organization. This film must always be a paradigm of exquisite cinema. The godfather is one of the best films of all time.

Cirilo J. Guzman"
9,Excellent Movie,"Is The Godfather a candidate for the best movie of all time and a masterclass in filmmaking?

I'd make the argument that this is the gangster movie par excellence.

You don't need to worry; the time will fly by and you won't even realise the movie is almost three hours long.

With such high production values and stunning visuals throughout, the film, which is over fifty years old, puts many contemporary movies to shame.

This movie is still and always will be one of the best; it has had a significant impact throughout the years.

I could list many more Incredible performances-Brandon, Pacino, and Castellano are just a few."
3,"For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great"
10,Best Gangster Movie,"This is the best gangster movie I have ever seen. Acting, Story, Action all things are amazing."
10,A masterpiece,"There is little to add to the comments on this message board and numerous other sources- The Godfather is simply the best movie released. Not ""Best Gangster Movie"", not ""Best Mafia Movie""- there are no qualifiers needed. The movie captures so many elements of great cinema- story, casting, writing, direction, production qualities, that it rises above every other movie released. See this movie and marvel at the transformation of Michael Corleone, the intensity of Sonny, the ineptness of Fredo, the emptiness of Connie and how Tom Hagen calculates every move, always looking for the acceptance from the rest of the family. Vito Corleone is a study of cunning abilities. The family looks to him for guidance and advice, even while the world is moving so quickly to overtake them."
10,Classic!,"I just watched The Godfather and I'm absolutely blown away. It's a classic that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life. The story follows the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia family, and the struggles of its patriarch, Don Vito Corleone.

Marlon Brando gives an incredible performance as Don Vito Corleone. His portrayal is powerful, charismatic, and captivating. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Diane Keaton all deliver outstanding performances. The direction is masterful, with Francis Ford Coppola bringing the story to life.

The Godfather is an iconic movie that is a must-watch for any movie fan. The story is captivating, the characters are compelling, and the performances are all excellent. It's a timeless classic that will remain a favorite of movie fans for years to come. Highly recommended."
10,"Close, but not the greatest","""The Godfather"" is a visceral achievement in moviemaking and has a rightful place near the top of any list of the greatest films ever made. It seizes your attention, doesn't let go and takes you down the road promised to immigrants to America -- before taking a turn in which we confront the prejudices, mistrust and other roadblocks to the realization of their dreams, and how they went on to create success on their terms. But I have to put it near the top, not AT the top. That honor, on my list, belongs to ""The Godfather Part II,"" for a reason that it's hard to fault Coppola for. In ""The Godfather,"" I found Michael to be too far outside the family at the beginning of the movie. While not renouncing his father, Sonny or their enterprise, Michael seems to be more of an observer in an Army uniform with his white-bread girlfriend nearby than a family member PLANNING to immerse himself in the life his father and brother have chosen. Obviously Michael is drawn closer to his family as it becomes threatened with, then targeted by, violence. This is understandable but, to me, not foreshadowed by the life outside the family that he had chosen a few years earlier and seemed to be comfortable with. Of course, ""Part II"" gives a much fuller picture of how Michael got to where he was in running the enterprise, and heading the family. But we already know all we need to know about his motives and choices -- courtesy of ""The Godfather."" This deeper, more realized character of Michael in ""Part II"" is the reason I rate it ahead of ""The Godfather"" -- but not by much."
9,One of the best movies I've seen,"I got acquainted with the human side of the criminal world in a distinctive way that sympathizes with the hero a lot, and it was confirmed that such a world has a great price that must be paid in this world as it is paid in the hereafter."
10,Words Are Not Enough,"Cinema lovers all over the world consider this movie as the best movie ever. And to some extent I agree . The plot of the movie has been repeated and copied by so many movies coming after this, that it will be of no use of me explaining it.

The characters of this movie have become legends especially of Don Vito Corleone played by the great Marlon Brando. Many other actors in different movie industries tried to emulate this character in their own way but failed to create an impact as huge as Brando created. But the character who keeps his own amongst the geniusness around is Michael Corleone which gave a first glimpse of the acting prowess of one of the greatest actors of this generation Al Pacino . Another actor who impressed is the great Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) who played the supporting part to perfection. The movie is almost 3 hours long but nowhere the movie loses its grip on the audience .Coppola has made sure that the audiences are craving for what is going to be the next twist in the movie .The best scene in the movie according to me is the Baptism and the enemy killings scene which showcased the great capabilities of the director. ""I will make him an offer he can't refuse"" can be called as one of the best dialogues of the cinema history. This is one movie any cinema lover cannot afford to miss

Rating : 9/10"
9,A masterpiece of cinema,"A thrilling film that explores the Italian mafia and reveals its codes and rituals. Its rhythm, the lights, the omerta, the climate of tension contribute to plunge us into the heart of this microsome known only by initiates. Many scenes such as the assassination attempt of Vito Corleone and the aftermath are so striking that they remain engraved in us as ""Do not tell me that you are innocent because it is an insult to my intelligence and it makes me in a bad mood."" A pure timeless masterpiece to see and see again."
3,Shush,"People like to talk about this movie like they helped write the screenplay, you didn't though. People talk about this movie like only three movies have ever been made, they made other movies. Men, specifically talk about this movie in a manner that makes me want to wash my hands off immediately afterwards. People talk about this movie with an insistence that I listen to their every word as if I have never before been bored to death by some schmoe who's seen less than half as many movies as I've seen, no please go on telling me about how gritty and realistic this candy ass farce of a crime movie you think this is."
10,A Masterpiece that can never be replaced,The originality of this movie till today fascinates me and there will never be one like it
10,good,"""The best sequel in history, IMDb score of 9 points, the sequel to The Godfather adventure... Usually sequels are disappointing after the first film and are not much preferred by people, but The Godfather 2, on the contrary, was as successful as the first film, even the first film received 3 Oscars, but the second, that is, this film received 6 Oscars. It is also currently ranked third on IMDB after The Price of Captivity and the first film of The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola also used the time event of more than 3 hours in every film he made in this film and received the criticism of ""I'm bored because of the long time"" by some people. In fact, the time was so long that Coppola had to remove Fabrizio's death scene, Hyman Roth's identity will be revealed, and a few scenes of Vito Corleone and add them to special DVD sets. This film tells about how Michael Corleone rose in the criminal world and reached his father's power, Vito Corleone's life from childhood to youth, until he had children. In addition, Robert De Niro put on one of the most incredible performances in history and played the character of Vito Corleone as if Marlon Brando were playing the youth. Every movement is exactly the same, down to the behavior and even the way of scratching the face. As always, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall have shown exquisite acting. The past and future of the Corleone family take place in this film, there are also new faces and enemies in the film. It's like a Hyman Roth character. The Hyman Roth character will want to trick Michael and take everything he has and kill him, he will use a surprise in this, and you will experience a shock effect when you see this person. Although the film was shot only 2 years after the first film, that is, in 1974, it feels like it was shot 20 years later. With its music, fiction, screenplay and acting, lines, it is a masterpiece, a film that is at the top again as always."""
9,Its a great crime drama!,"My childhood fantasy and dreamy experience to cinema. Its a great great crime drama i ever seen. This one is a best in trivia of Godfather. The all cast is mind blowing specially Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was superb. James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden and John Marley also was great."
10,Greatest movie,"A towering achievement in cinema, The Godfather is the ultimate crime drama. Every element, from Francis Ford Coppola's meticulous direction to the unforgettable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, is flawlessly executed. The film masterfully blends intimate character development with an epic tale of family, power, and betrayal. Its themes of loyalty, corruption, and the American Dream resonate as deeply today as they did upon release. Every frame is a work of art, enriched by a haunting score and unforgettable dialogue. Decades later, The Godfather remains a timeless classic that continues to captivate and influence generations of filmmakers and moviegoers alike. Its legacy is not only that of one of the greatest films ever made, but also of a cultural touchstone that defined cinematic excellence."
10,GREATEST MOTION PICTURE EVER AND OF YEARS TO COME!,"The Godfather is without a doubt the Greatest Movie of our time and of anybody else's time. The brutally brilliant and passionate film is about the violent Mafia family, the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (Best Actor Academy Award Winner Marlon Brando) is passing on the family business to one of his sons-but which one? He decides to skip over the oldest son, the hotheaded Santino (Academy Award Nominee James Caan); He also decides to skip over cowardly Frederico (John Cazale); In the end he passes it down to youngest son, the intelligent Michael (Academy Award Nominee Al Pacino). This movie won the Academy Award for best picture in 1972 and deservedly so. Great performances by Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall. It deserves to be the IMDB's highest rated film and #3 on the American Film Institute's Best List. It should be number 1. On a scale of one to ten, this gets a 100."
10,Masterpiece,"I think it is the most brilliant film of all time. Perfectly cast and symmetrically structured. The rising of Michael to unwillingly become the Godfather after realizing he's the perfect mix between brother Tom and Sonny, give this film the perfect balance between irony and destiny."
10,Cult Movie,"Godfather is one of the greatest movies of all time, it has all the ingredients of cult movie such as well weaved story telling, actors who have given the life to every dialogue, and yes the tremendous work done by the director."
9,I LIKE IT,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Do not miss this film!"
10,slogan: a movie of a lifetime.,"Slogan: a movie of a lifetime Wow. The best movie I have ever seen. Period. If you have seen this movie you shouldn't be allowed to rate others, because it will influence your rating so much. Watch it."
10,Good mafia movie,"The first of the films I watched. I fell in love with the film for the atmosphere of the 50s: cars, clothes, people's behavior, music. In short, I couldn't help but fall in love with this movie. It's full of drama and unexpected twists. I won't spoil the plot for you. But I think that those who love the aesthetics of the 50s will not remain indifferent."
3,This film is a bad influence on people,"Money or materialism is the embodiment of human greed and the way the gangsters go about their lives, breaking laws and committing barbaric animalistic acts of terror just for money is a poor cultural showcase to people around the world. I give it a 3 out of 10 as the characters at least dress well and have some sense of professionalism though twisted as it is.

The plot is actually quite simple and basic for a movie with such a high rating, there's a few thought provoking lines but other than that it's just the case of lawless organisations pitted against each other for the sake of money so if a mindless violent movie obsessing over money obsessed gangs is your thing then go for it and cheer your heart out for the amounts of money the rich mafia firms you imagine stole or received."
9,Wonderful movie,"The Italian church and the successful representative of the underworld in the United States and other capitalist countries in the world of flight, adventure, foothold, revenge, whitewash growth history, mixed knead the family, love, friendship under different circumstances and burst. Family interests above all, all against the growth and development of the family must be eliminated. The coexistence of interests is the basis of harmony, and the difference of interests is the beginning of hostility. When the old father dies, a new one is born. Is the beginning of the end which cannot be stopped."

10,One of the best movies ever made,"The Godfather is a very well-produced film, featuring excellent acting, an outstanding cast, a compelling script, and masterful direction. It will certainly be appreciated by generations to come, providing insight into how the Mafia operated in the 1940s. In my opinion, a particularly striking aspect is the importance Don Vito Corleone places on his family. Everyone should watch this movie!"
10,Mario Puzo's Godfather,"By and Far The Godfather is a brilliant film, I would not say it's the greatest film ever but for it's era it was ground breaking as it sealed Marlon Brando's status as a hollywood legendary and introduced to the world many of today's iconic actors such as Al Pacino and Robert Duvall."
10,"See it or ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse""","This is movie making at it's best, with a golden tinge in each camera frame. There's not much I can say about this film that has not already been said. Everyone's seen it. Everyone knows that it ain't gonna be surpassed for a long time. And while that day is far from today, watch and enjoy everday.

There are so many different memorable scenes in the film, which is one of the reasons it has survived for so long as a classic. Any new gangster movie these days offers very little of we didn't see in The Godfather. The hard-nosed brutality, the lust for money, the gambling, womanising. The only thing that no-one could ever pinch from The Godfather, and make it look better, is waking up to find the bloody-head of a horse, sleeping with you in your bed.

The philosophy plays a big part of the film and provides its unique blend of characters with great depth. We also see a great zoom-in shot when Michael (Pacino) devises a plan to assassinate a mafia boss, that killed his father (Brando) and the dishonorable who Michael seeks revenge for receiving a black eye from him. Here we see the good, young Michael take his very first step into the world of terror, that follows him for the rest of trilogy. Beautifully scripted, makes directing look like a piece of art, performances from all actors are incredible."
10,Best cinema productions,A series of films of the strongest productions of the world cinema wonderful in every sense of the drama in particular
10,The Godfather (1972) - A Cinematic Masterpiece of Crime and Family Drama,"""The Godfather"" stands as a cinematic masterpiece and a monumental achievement in the crime drama genre. Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, the film delves into the world of the Corleone crime family, their struggles for power, and the complexities of loyalty and family ties.

At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a tale of power, ambition, and the consequences that come with living a life within the underworld. The narrative revolves around Don Vito Corleone, portrayed with haunting intensity by Marlon Brando. Brando's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing, with his iconic raspy voice and commanding presence, making him one of the most memorable characters in cinematic history. He portrays Vito as a man of principles, who operates by his own moral code in the world of crime.

The film's central focus is on Vito's son, Michael Corleone, played brilliantly by Al Pacino. Michael starts as an outsider, choosing to distance himself from the family business and opting for a more legitimate path. However, as circumstances force him to take on a more active role, we witness his gradual transformation into a ruthless and calculating leader. Pacino's portrayal of Michael's character arc is nothing short of astonishing, showcasing his talent and range as an actor.

The supporting cast also delivers outstanding performances, contributing to the film's overall brilliance. James Caan as hotheaded Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as the loyal family consigliere Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Michael's love interest Kay Adams, all provide memorable and compelling performances that add depth to the narrative.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in Coppola's masterful direction and attention to detail. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold naturally while building suspense and tension. Coppola's use of shadow and light in cinematography gives the film an atmospheric and visually striking quality. The iconic score composed by Nino Rota further elevates the emotional impact of pivotal scenes, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's memory.

Moreover, ""The Godfather"" boasts a rich and well-developed script that seamlessly blends powerful dialogues with intense and emotionally charged moments. The film skillfully explores themes of loyalty, tradition, family dynamics, and the price of power. It humanizes the characters, making them relatable despite their morally questionable actions.

In addition to its compelling storytelling, ""The Godfather"" is a testament to meticulous set design and authentic period detail. The movie effortlessly transports viewers back to the 1940s and immerses them in the world of the mafia, thanks to the attention given to costumes, props, and locations.

""The Godfather"" had an immense impact on the film industry, shaping the crime drama genre and inspiring numerous subsequent films. It earned eleven Academy Award nominations, with Brando winning the Best Actor award for his iconic performance. The film also secured Oscars for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, highlighting its enduring legacy and influence.

Even after five decades, ""The Godfather"" continues to be revered and celebrated by critics and audiences alike. It remains a benchmark of cinematic excellence, and its cultural impact is still felt today. From its unforgettable dialogues to its profound exploration of human nature, the film stands as a timeless work of art.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" (1972) is a cinematic triumph that remains unrivaled in its genre. Francis Ford Coppola's direction, the outstanding performances of its cast, and the engrossing storytelling combine to create a captivating and unforgettable cinematic experience. This timeless classic will continue to captivate generations to come, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films in cinema history."
9,greatest film,"What a movie, what a cast. I love this flick so much, it blows me away every time I watch it."
8,Classic movie,This classic has lasted the test of time. Always great to watch.
10,Watch it in one sitting.,"This movie is widely regarded professional movie critics as one of the greatest films of all time.

I myself am in one-hundred percent agreement with this assessment.

Fifty years on from release what can I add to the canon of reviews that has not been said? This! For you young people (or anyone else) who have not seen it yet or seen it but not start to finish I say the following. Block out some time and watch it beginning to end on one of the streaming services. No watching it on AMC or TCM with all their commercial breaks. Dont watch it over two nights. It is long but to fully appreciate it, do yourself a favor, and watch it all at once!"
9,Amazing Movie,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Beautiful crafted movie.
10,Very Good!!,"This movie is the best I've seen. Very Good!!!Perfect!!!I also saw the God father II&III, but I think I is the best , the I story also the best!

Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed the Godfather films, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release as The Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years later The Godfather, Part II balanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?) The Godfather, Part III was mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid"
9,Mafia Movie,"The Godfather is considered one of the best movies ever made for several reasons. The film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful and influential Italian-American mafia clan. The movie is praised for its complex characters, masterful storytelling, and unforgettable scenes. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, and the performances of Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are equally impressive. The Godfather is a brutal and magnificent sweep of storytelling that has stood the test of time.

Run to watch it !"
10,The godfather,"And yet I came to the conclusion that the godfather, the movie is very eternal, classic, inimitable, this movie belongs to those films that leave a trace, even your communion in it, thanks to the atmosphere created by the music of the Company, and the main Sicilian theme of Godfather, by the greatest actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton. I will not talk about the essence of the book or the movie, what it teaches us, in any case, everyone determines for himself what to take from this movie or book. The book, like the film, are not masterpieces of literature and cinema, they are outside the framework of this space, they have a separate place in the repository, as something special, personal, making you worry, sympathize, not understand, but admire every time. Times are changing, techniques and techniques are being improved, the picture is better, dynamic, films are being made about gangsters, about the underworld. I do not know what the secret of Copolla is, but this movie will remain for me the first among the first. I belong to the generation born."
10,amazing . One of the best movies that has a great role model for storytelling ......,"It's hard to make a movie that doesn't bother the viewer at all, but the high power shakes the viewer. All I can say is that it doesn't diminish the appeal of this film"
10,God of Cinema...best movie of all time,"Just fantastic , especially parts 1 & 2. MUST WATCH if u still did not."
9,Masterful filmmaking!,"The deed is done, and I have finally watched one of, if not the most celebrated, works of art in the history of cinema, i.e. Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather.""

Although I have plenty to talk about, I will keep things short and only speak of a few pointers and aspects that made notable impressions.

First and foremost, the screenplay is astonishing-one of the finest pieces of literature I have ever encountered.

Despite being three hours long in length, I never felt the pace weighing down the script; there was this natural flow to it that kept things interesting as well as moving. Except for this one particular occasion, where Michael goes into hiding after assassinating the police chief (in Sicily) and ends up marrying a Sicilian girl, that part felt a bit inconsequential and honestly the only segment for which I hold reservations, for the rest? I have no complaints whatsoever.

And now the second thing that made the biggest impression was the character development of both Corleone, the father, and the son. Not to mention, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino had given their all and made their parts even more alive and believable."
8,It is a fairly good Mafia Movie !!!,"Marlon Brando was a great actor, who could amply improve a given role by his own imagination and Method based on his raw, visceral and natural acting style. He could add many dimensions to a given character /role by his own charismatic personality, demeanor and voice. People will never forget Stanley Kowalski of ""A street Car Named Desire"", Napoleon Bonaparte of ""Desiree"" and Christian Fletcher of ""The Mutiny on the Bounty"". He was definitely a living legend of his time, a towering personality over other contemporary actors.

Mario Puso's Godfather owes a lot to Marlon Brando, who was shown as an aging patriarch (Don Vito Corleone) teaching tricks of the underworld ominous trade to his young cub,(Michael Corleone) portrayed by Al-Pacino. As the young role demanded, Al-Pacino's innocent face and if not simple, straight acting style was appropriate while the old man's (Brando's ) visage bore the complexities of life's bitter machinations that were required of him to get to the top rung of the clandestine Mafia Empire.

It is beautifully directed while punctuating the cinematic sequence with retrospective details of the elder Corleone's youth. It takes the audience to the old times with a pensive setting that approaches the status quo/wealth and waste of American Underworld.

Howsoever great the title and story of this movie as well the acting skills of Marlon Brando, but it cannot be regarded as the all time great movie EVER MADE. There is more to the Mafia and Underworld than meets the eye after watching this movie. The human intellect is endowed with exploring and implementing even more innovative ways of the negative side as one can imagine.

Nevertheless, it is a good effort at revealing the gory and ruthless side of the criminal dark world."
10,One of the Worst American Films Ever Made,"After experiencing the Godfather many years ago, I finally made my mind up that this might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Taking a humanistic viewpoint on an unbelievable and fictitious Italian family mob, The Corleone's, communicates to me how truly ""unAmerican"" this movie is. Seeing how Michael Corleone (aka Al Pacino's worst role) is experiencing inner dualism between morales and his family showed me how boring this movie really is. When I'm watching a good ""American"" film I want action, not character development! This movie was one big slumber-fest and there wasn't enough boobs!

But what truly made me come to this decision was discovering the pile of popcorn and butter vomit that came from my mouth onto my smart phone's IMDb application, after revisiting this so called winner of ""Best Picture,"" ""Best Actor,"" and ""Best Adapted Screenplay."" Critics of Coppola's uncreative, cookie-cutter, three hour long cheep film cheated and lied to the American population. Make no mistake, this ""Italian"" cultured film is worse than a serving of stuffed calamari in tomato sauce with no garlic, rotten eggs, and a pregnant squid pulled out of the Sarno River.

For the those of you spent time to even explore the other two parts of the story, I apologize. When I eventually got up from my imitation leather lazy-boy for a bathroom break all that came out was Marlon Brando's crappy performance. Not to mention Diane Keaton ""expanding"" her acting career... should of stayed with Woody. I feel this movie was pretentious and belittled the American audience. Even Italian film theorist Jean Epstein would probably say, this movie was about as sincere as using Ragu in spaghetti. For my own taste, I'm going to stick with the true mob classics like Corky Romano and Mobsters (with the truly talented Christian Slater). Thanks for the waste of time Francis Ford Coppola!"
8,one of the best,"I wish to do the same Directing , its amazing in all way"
9,a great movie,"The Godfather is the classic mob movie. The film is totally different from all the others in its genre. The way Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote this film so that the viewer actually sympathizes with the characters of the Italian mafia. Within the first scene the writers introduced all the main characters and all that's left to the film are twists, suspense, surprises and thrills.

The film also has many romantic scenes. Michael Corleone (Pacino) is in Sicily and walking through the open country when he and his two bodyguards stumble upon a beautiful young woman leading a school of children. Their eyes meet and it's love at first sight. Michael being brought up with the utmost respect went to the girls father and asked to meet her in the presence of their family. The viewer can't help but think `How sweet.' Fortunately the father approves and love blossoms into marriage.

The acting in the film is like no other and with so many big stars the viewer can't help but be excited to see so many great names in one film. Marlon Brando plays the role of the Godfather AKA Don Corleone, the leader of one out of five Italian mafias in the New York area. The way Brando developed his character was amazing and his famous voice in the film that has been mimicked for 30 years now sounds untouchable in it's originality. Al Pacino plays Brando's son Michael Corleone, who actually wasn't wanted for the part at the time but the studio cast him with the recommendation from the Director (Francis Coppola). Pacino actually sets the bar for himself when he took this role, and for all the future roles he would play in Mafia movies. His acting is compelling, and his looks are almost unrecognizable.

There are actually no innocent by-standers that get hurt or victimized in the film that you might see in other mafia movies. Infact everyone that ends up dead were people that were a part of one of the mafia families. The whole film is about respect and the closeness of family if you can see behind all the violence.

The film is quite long to sit through in one sitting but is totally worth it by the end. The film will grab you in an instant with curiosity to the underground world of the mob.

This is undoubtedly the best mob movie ever. This film is recommended for people that love mafia films. And for the people who don't really care for these types of movies this film will change your mind on organized crime movies."
10,God Father!,Its amazing film so far. I watch all God Father movies every year.
9,Filmaço,"Vito: personagem forte, carisma através de uma postura firme e empática. Construção a partir do personagem pronto, retrocedendo para sua origem......."
1,Zzzzz,"I don't know why this is rated so highly. It is dated and I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing happens for a very long time and when it does, it is ok, but this ""great"" film represents three hours of my life I will never get back. Better watching ""The Sopranos."""
10,The Review of the Godfather,"The Godfather is one of the best important works in the history of the movies. It tells a story about the gangster.And it is the greatest gangster film of alltime. We can not only catch a glimpse ofthe life of the gangsters through this movie, but can know the principle that wehave to accept something we dislike, forthe duty, or someone we love.In the really life, we may have to accept something sometime, like the Michael.Maybe we may feel unhappy or angry. Butin a people's life, it's always the situationlike that, and we have to experience them."
8,A masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that holds a special place in my heart, earning a solid 8/10 rating. The acting is nothing short of phenomenal, with Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone leaving an indelible mark. The film editing is expertly crafted, seamlessly weaving a sprawling narrative filled with power struggles and family dynamics. Its strength lies in its exploration of the blurred lines between morality and loyalty, making it a timeless classic. While some might find its runtime a weakness, I believe it only adds to the epic scale of the story. The music, particularly the haunting theme by Nino Rota, is both evocative and unforgettable. The cinematography captures the dark elegance of the mafia world with every frame. ""The Godfather"" is more than a film; it's a cinematic opera that has left an enduring legacy, and my love for it knows no bounds."

10,Beautiful,"Watch it and you'll know it. Great casting, great direction, great storytelling."
10,A Masterpiece,"The Godfather is arguably THE defining drama motion picture of the 20th century. The character presentation was magnificent. Though Al Pacino had other great movies prior to this, Brando obviously took a shine to him and really mentored this actor in ways I believe no one can imagine. Pacino evolved and solidified the role of the head of the family that I believe is still being used in references today. A strong but loving Father figure, ruthless and forceful at times, Pacino drew on his personal background greatly during this role.

James Caan was spot on as Sonny. The typical view of Italian temper as well as showing the eagerness to make a dollar. This role was the glue in the first half of the film.

Talia Shire, just too good. What can one write about a flawless performance. The quintessential bad Italian daughter, awful wife and terrible sister. Scorned by her brother, bitter in the end of this movie, Mrs. Shire is wonderful in portraying the suppressed spirit of the true Italian mob family member.

John Cazale is a piece of work. As Fredo, he embodies the mob family's image of the family member ""you should have just given money to instead of letting him in the business"". What a smart role for a great actor. Through it all Fredo was the one family member that was actually true to himself the whole time. He loved his family dearly, wanted to earn money, and absolutely craved respect. I love how he was always like the lamb in the lions den no one worried too much about. The movie was tailored such that if one thinks about it, the family is the one that let Fredo down by not recognizing his inherent shortcomings.

Robert Duvall is a Master Counselor in the movie, but most the important contribution Duvall made was as an outsider. Not an Italian. His portrayal as someone who could be loyal and not blood Italian was huge in the USA at this time. I believe Duvall's role made it almost OK for races to interact with each other better without using side glances. This is a great testament to Duvall and one I don't believe was intended by the director or screenplay.

Finally there is Mr. Marlo Brando. There's nothing to say but marvelous, magnificent, platinum performance."
10,"Best Film in the Past, present, and Future.","this film, is the best film I ever seen out of hundreds of movies. every other month I feel that I need to watch the first part or the second part of the series of the God father again and again. Which they are the best. even they were considered 70s but they still one of the best movies have ever produced and have been filmed to the humanity ! story of power and energy, family, reality of American History. also no one can ignore the music and themes of this films that takes to different world or different planet. the Italian accent also is adding a lot of art to the movie picture. with one word describing this film it is a story of dreams life !"
1,One of the worst movies ever watched,I can't believe this movie got 9.2 rating. Maybe people think everything Italian is good.
10,incrivel,"É um filme magnifico, melhor que já vi. É um filme magnifico, melhor que já vi."
10,Real movie,"Until now, still the best film ever. I can't understand why, but this is a real movie, with real emotions and story telling."
10,GODFATHER,One of the best movie gangster movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone. If you are a die hard fan of gangster movies you will definitely going to love this.
10,amazing,I love this movie. I can watch it over over again.
10,a offer you can't ressice,"I had never seen the godfather til a month ago the reason i saw this was because everyone who has seen it said it was a masterpiece. This you probably don't care but when i saw it they were right this was by far my favorite movie. If you like mafia movies, or liked the movie snatch you will love this movie. Even though it is 3 hours long it still seems like it's to short. There is nothing in this movie i hated and believe me it's an offer you can't resisce."
10,Godfather errors.,"Actually Sonny's car is a 1940 or 1941 Lincoln Continental.

When Michael rides in the 1941 Buick with McClusky and Sollozo, notice that the steering wheel shows a lot of wear on the rim, and the rear window panes are starting to delaminate- this is indicated by the odd shapes on lower inner corners of the glass. This would not occur on a car less than 10 years old (at the time of the scene), but certainly would on a car that was over thirty years old.

Sonny's shooting was actually filmed on an airport runway, but the toll booths are exactly as I remember as I grew up on Long Island. I first saw The Godfather in a theatre in Roslyn, Long Island and got pulled over by a cop on the way there so I missed the first 20 minutes! It's still my favourite film."
9,A movie which taught everything to cinema lovers from basics .,"It is very mesmerizing movie. It contains a lot of element like suspense,thriller action,drama and hell lot of things. This is the movie which people remembered to decades. I can surely say that this is bingo watch movie. The direction is mind blowing.on the safe side, i can surely say that this is the movie which utilize your time properly."
5,Great!,"Great movie, i loved the writing involved showing how what happens in Italian families."
10,The best movie that i watched,"""The Godfather"", directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film explores the complexity of the Italian Mafia in the United States and the impact of power on the Corleone family. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is monumental, bringing emotional depth to the character. Al Pacino, as Michael, shows a subtle and powerful transformation, reflecting the loss of his innocence. Coppola's direction and Nino Rota's score elevate the narrative, making it a fascinating study of morality and corruption. It is a work that continues to be relevant, offering an intense reflection on the dynamics of power and human nature."
10,Best filme ever,Great movie and great cast! Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to The Godfather. But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.
10,belief,"The film, at first glance, tells the story of an aspiring young man who degenerated into a Mafia boss. However, if you think about it more deeply, you will find that it is actually a process in which people choose between survival, integration into the environment and changing the environment so as to complete themselves. To go a little bit further, it's about how people's beliefs change people."
10,Bring Back 70s movies.,"With the complete and total abscence of excessive computer effects, Godfather is impeccable on storyline, character development, and acting. No excessive violence. No excessive swearing. Simple how every movie should be."
10,This may be the best movie ever made yet,"For me i can't think of anything negative about this movie, it is simply a masterpiece, and i firmly believe that if anyone hates on this movie he just does not understand cinema, the plot,cinematography,characters,sound,writing,pacing everything is perfect, It is hard nowdays to find a movie as good as the old ones especially this one and it could easily be top 1 movie."
10,gooood,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando).

The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."
9,Great Movie,"I actually sat down today and watched The Godfather. I had held off from watching it until now, afraid that it wouldn't live up to it's 'greatest movie ever' title that almost everyone seems to place on it. Fortunately, I can say that I wasn't disappointed. While after one viewing I'm not sure if I would personally call it the greatest movie I've ever seen, I can understand why people would say that. It's a great movie all the way around.....the cast, the dialogue, the sound track is all top-notch. Everyone involved gave great performances from top to bottom. Watching how Al Pacino's character changes through the movie is amazing.

I noticed a few people made comments saying how long the movie was. To be honest I was so into the movie that it seemed to go by pretty quickly. Someone also said that you'll find better made-for-tv movies than this. Believe, I highly doubt that you ever will.

All in all, I can say that this is one movie that definitely lives up to the hype that is surrounding it. I would highly recommend that everyone go out and watch this movie at least once. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,you should watch it,"this movie has action its an okay movie, on the count of a few actors but most of the actors are good play rollers who take there part and do what they got to do. mean while others do not and just don't care that much. this movie had a lot of enthusiasm, action, adventure, and its based on an old time mafia gang. which is practically why so many people rate so high. its an amazing story based on 5 tribes who want power over the whole city. there is a wise tribe, aggressive tribe, smart tribe, poor tribe, and a rich tribe. these five families have different ways of surviving and gaining trust over the other 4.due to an overwhelm of one taking to much land it causes trouble. so that's when the action begins to happen. so i would highly recommend this movie to all who want to watch it or just want to know what its about."
9,love this,Love it for all types of reason. it feel like you are actually in the scene.
10,OVERATEDAND TRASH TRASH TRASH,"This movie has bad graphics it isnt even cool and awesome like the I. T. crowd or spiderman. Too long and too boring needs more action. This is overated how do people like this. I would rather watch Man of Steel than this trash. Lets be real here, the only reason peoplem even like this movie is because it is hyped up to be awesome. Its like the family guy joke, i hate family guy but i have to agreee with peter girffin, this movie insists upon itself to such a degree whjere it becomes un watchable please, do yourself a favor and watch a different movie, here are some suggestions, 1. 12 angry men, Avengers age of ultron, Five nights at freddy's and Big with tom hanks."
9,classic,"My favorite movie, and it is really classic. Even it is 40+ years since 1972, you can hardly find one which could hit you or your soul like The Godfather."
10,"my favourite film, ""The Godfather""","Words are hard to find, to describe my love of this film. Every time I view this film I still find something to marvel at... something that I had missed on previous viewings. I too, believe that this is a flawless film. On one viewing, I was struck by the use of lighting in the film, how contrasting the lighting was. The use of light and dark, so beautifully used throughout the film, to me, symbolised the light and dark of these characters, and the world in which they lived. I love the portrayals of Mario Puzo's characters... Marlon Brando was superb.I loved watching Michael Corleone change from a naive young war-hero to a ruthless mafia godfather. I loved each of the characters in this film. That is one of the things that I like best about this film... that these ruthless men worked their way into my heart, casting away any judgement I would usually hold against people who do the hideous crimes that these men saw as merely work and necessary protection for their beloved family. I love their self-righteousness and even their lack of conscience. I am passionate about this film ... every damn aspect of it!!!"
10,The Definitive Crime-Drama Movie,"The epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day one of America's most accomplished feature films. This movie is so good that it's not just a movie, it's a movie that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time.

One thing that makes this movie a classic is that it defined how bad violence in a movie can be. When you see movie character Luca Brasi stabbed in the hand while he's being strangled to death, you realize that the director likes to take this movie seriously and make an example of how far a movie can go when it comes to violence. I'll admit that when I saw this movie for the first time in my life it wasn't very good in my opinion. When I saw this movie being #3 on AFI's {American Film Institute} Top 100 American Movies Of All Time, I thought it really didn't deserved that spot. But when I gave it another chance, my opinion changed. I said to myself, ""This movie represents the best of movies like what the Statue of Liberty represnts to America"".

In short, this movie is fantastic. What Star Wars is to Sci-fi is what Godfather is to Crime-Drama, meaning it's a perfect example of the genre. There will probably never be another movie like this in many decades to come."
10,GOAT,GOAT! Plain and simply the greatest movie ever made.
10,A Symphony of Power and Loyalty: The Godfather,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, stands as a monumental pillar in the realm of cinematic storytelling. At its inception, the narrative unfurls with a meticulous structure, drawing viewers into a world where family ties and criminal enterprises are indistinguishably intertwined. The Corleone family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, portrayed with a blend of ferocity and tenderness by Marlon Brando, encapsulates the dichotomy of brutal authority and deep familial love.

The film's thematic depth is as rich and complex as its narrative. It delves into the nuances of power, loyalty, and the American Dream, all set against a backdrop of organized crime. The transformation of Michael Corleone, played with a chilling subtlety by Al Pacino, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss, is a study in character development. His journey reflects the film's exploration of the corrupting influence of power and the moral compromises required in the pursuit of dominance.

Technically, ""The Godfather"" is a marvel. Gordon Willis' cinematography paints each scene with a palette that is both opulent and ominous, echoing the film's mood. Nino Rota's score, with its hauntingly beautiful theme, further elevates the emotional impact of the narrative. The editing, particularly in the iconic baptism sequence, is a masterclass in building tension and drawing parallels between disparate actions.

As the film progresses, one cannot help but become emotionally invested in the characters' fates. Their complexities and the film's refusal to paint them as merely heroes or villains create a narrative that is as morally grey as it is captivating. The film's ability to make the audience empathize with, and even root for, characters who operate in the moral shadows is a testament to its narrative prowess.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is more than just a film; it is a cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. Its exploration of family, power, and morality is as relevant today as it was at its release. On a scale of 10, I would rate it a well-deserved 9.5. It is a film that not only defined a genre but also elevated the art of cinema itself. For those who have yet to witness its magnificence, prepare for a journey into the heart of darkness, illuminated by flashes of loyalty, love, and the unquenchable thirst for power."
10,Deserving its regard as one of the best films of all time,"There are so many reasons why this is a great film: unforgettable music (especially that theme that adapts itself to so many different moods), striking cinematography, strong pacing, but first and foremost are the performances. The entire cast shines; no wonder so many of them--mostly unknowns at the time, like Pacino, Duvall, Keaton, and Caan--went on to stellar careers. But two performances stand out: Brando's and Pacino's.

Don Corleone is, in reality, little more than a well-dressed thug. But Brando infuses the Don with a regal manner: he carries himself like a king and speaks in dignified cadences. He dispenses vengeance and vice, but calls them justice and business. Even that infamous mumbling adds to the effect--it makes everyone (including the audience) lean forward, in respectful silence, to hear this powerful man speak. We should despise Corleone, but Brando's charisma in the role--arguably his best in a remarkable career--wins us over.

It's Pacino, however, who carries the bulk of the film, along with our sympathy. He is, we are led to believe, the hero of the story: when Michael first appears, he's outside in the light, whereas the Don first appeared in a dark, shaded lair. He's in love with a woman from a brighter world (it's no coincidence Diane Keaton's hair was coloured blonde for this movie), and assures her that he's not like the rest of his family. We want the best for him: we hope he'll escape his family's unsavory business.

But gradually, Michael gets drawn into those dark rooms his father inhabits. Pacino masterfully portrays a character who tries to be a hero, who tries to defend or avenge those he loves, but loses himself in the process. By the end of the film, Michael Corleone is positively reptillian--cold-blooded, predatory, calculating, a creature without remorse or morality. He has gained the world but lost his soul.

Normally, we would regard a man like Michael Corleone from afar with a mixture of revulsion and fear. We would think him inhuman, refusing to recognize anything of ourselves in him. But Coppola makes us identify with Michael, sympathize with him. If he's become a monster by the end of the film, we've been forced to recognize that we, too, could become monsters in the right (or wrong) circumstances. We have stared into the abyss, and found that it contains a dark, distorted reflection.

With The Godfather, Coppola et al took rather base source material--a pulp crime novel--and elevated it to the realm of Shakespearean tragedy. This is great story-telling, great movie-making, and great art. 10/10."

10,Masterpiece,I will never talk about anything. just watch it and enjoy the legendary music.and take advises from corleone's father it will be usefull for your life.
9,Best movie in the world,I love this movie and all of the GF movies. This movie deserves first rank in top 250
9,Love it !,"I recently watched ""The Godfather"" for the first time and I was thoroughly impressed. This classic American film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia family in New York City.

What struck me most about the film was the depth of the characters and the intricate plot. Each character is well-developed and multi-dimensional, making them feel like real people instead of just caricatures. The story of the family's struggles and triumphs, both in their personal and criminal lives, kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film.

The acting was also top-notch, with Marlon Brando delivering a standout performance as the head of the family, Vito Corleone. The attention to detail in the sets, costumes, and cinematography all added to the film's authenticity and overall impact.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a must-watch for any fan of classic cinema. Its themes of family, power, and loyalty are timeless and still relevant today. I highly recommend it!"
9,The God Father,"Excellent tempo the Director has maintained throughout the movie marvelous taking and beautiful screenplay added to its best. I should congratulate the Director and the Producer for their participation in the movie, from the acting side Al Pacino did his best part in the movie Marlon Brando has lived in his portion. As far as re-recording is concern is excellent Photography at its best part of the movie, dialogues are moving, but one thing I could not understand how these people (behind the screen) got an idea to present in this manner? They presented this movie in such a way that it was so realistic that nobody can imagine. I never saw such a beautiful movie in my whole career in India."
10,First review of a amazing movie,"Absolutely loved this movie. The scenes, the acting, it was all so damn amazing! My favorite would be the Godfather himself, I absolutely love this film which is probably why I love Italian mobsters and the mafia so much, which is also why I love being able to play the bad guy. And also why I wanted to become a voice actor in the first place. And I've always wanted to meet the director and producer of this masterpiece, I know I'm new to IMDB so that's why this review is filled with some random stuff so I can get the whole ""Write a review"" thing out of the way lol, sorry if your reading this and it's a bunch of nonsense."
9,Highly overrated!,"When people hear the word ""Godfather"" they think, ""Best movie ever made!!!"". Well that is (in my opinion) a bunch of bullcrap!!! Don't get me wrong, The Godfather is an excellent piece of work, but I wouldn't go so far to say it is the best movie ever made. Personally, I like GoodFellas a little better. The Godfather has the best of all the qualities for a movie = great directing, great writing (not as good as the book), excellent acting (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall), and all that jazz, but I still don't think it is the best movie ever made. One of the top 10 movies ever made (most likely), One of the top 5 movies ever made (maybe), the best movie ever made (I don't think so). If you like Mafia movies, this is the one that started them. If you are looking for the best Mafia movie or televison show, watch ""The Sopranos"" Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. If you haven't seen ""The Godfather"" yet, I would rent it immediatley! Grade: A"
10,Best in genre,Not the best movie i ever seem but in My top 3 this movie dosent have a Hero or epic sence or...... Its just Show us Family life. Family matters (and some curismatic Character) and thats What i like abuot of this movie. I just can say. it was GREAT
5,Cool,"I like the presentation, I think I saw this long time ago, but I really can afford anything because I have born at 1994, I love my parent talk about this, good theme, trama, and the sequence go a story about this character than know how to be very godfather without limitations and not suppose to be a like him at non sense but I loved his performance."
10,Great masterpiece,"Epic! ...The first and the last movie on Earth.

Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.

Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience. Its tremendous work done. This movie depicts the sincere work with lots of love. No one can bring out such an epic movie, even if paid a billion dollars each. I just get up everytime I hear Godfatherto watch time and again."
10,one of my top movie,I give the godfather 10\10 it's one of my favorite movie ever
10,An epic film,"Simply a cinema classic. I highlight the script, the photography, the performances.

I consider that the story is compelling, the way in which the characters are built, the way in which Michael Corleone transforms, as if without being totally involved he shows what he is made of, seemed extraordinary to me.

From photography I liked the compositional treatment and the contrasts used.

From the montage, I liked it and thought it was very innovative about the alternate montage sequence of the church.

The sound seemed to me to be powerful, and like all good sounds, I considered it to be appropriate and fair.

Of the art, he highlighted the costumes, the treatment of locations, and the orderliness of all the settings."

9,A Story of Loyalty and Family,"The Godfather explores criminality, the temptations of wealth, loyalty, and what one is willing to do to protect those they love. There is a theme in the story of life and death, a duality of one thing ending and another beginning. While Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is a successful and capable character within a crime family, he only fills this role to protect those he loves. This film explores the ideas of the complicated villain. Justice, loyalty, and family are of ultimate importance, but there is a criminal twist to these ideals.

The Godfather asks us all: how far will you go to protect your family? And does the ends justify the means? The Corleone's enemies operate the same way as they do, eliminating any notion of good and evil. It's simply ""them vs us"". In such a vile environment, the only virtue one can have is loyalty.

In the opening of the film, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is throwing a wedding for his daughter. During this peaceful and happy family event, dozens of loyal followers come to Vito to pay their respects, and in some cases, request unhappy favors. The first guest shown with Vito elaborates an important point of the film: an Italian immigrant has been wronged and refused justice by a corrupt system. Therefore, the father goes down a dark path and comes to the Godfather for justice. This is an example of the ends justifying the means, the duality of using evil for good. In a way, the father received justice for his daughter, but he's also a murderer for taking the law into his own hands and punishing another beyond what the law would have called for. The opening scene also highlights the contrast of having a happy wedding while at the same time, making arrangements to have people murdered. This theme is reflected throughout the film, with a powerful ending."
9,"""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man""","When I first watched the Godfather, I thought it was long, and overrated. I really didn't understand what the hype was for, and why this film is so critically acclaimed, being #2 on IMDB's top 250 movies. It was only over time when I was reminded by it, such as the visual look of Don Vito Corleone, or the iconic quotes such as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", that I began to realise that I had witnessed a masterpiece. The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in history, that has truly influenced our society. There's good story telling, distinct memorable characters, and a very good ending. I don't believe that it's the 2nd greatest film of all time, I think films such as Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange and American Beauty are better, but it's certainly deserved a top 10 spot. Believe the hype."
9,Iconic,A latecomer to this classic. An iconic film. 9/10.
10,Perfect,"Easily the best movie i have ever seen. It is just peferct, the entire movie made me speechless. Perfet acting, perfect writing and perfect directing. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando gave us some of the best acting of all time, along with the genius directing of Francis ford Coppola. An instant master piece."
9,A favourite!,This is one of my all time favourite movies. I loved it. The acting by Brando and Pacino is superb in my opinion.
10,An Iconic Film,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
10,The most complete movie ever made,"This movie is the only movie I've seen it three times. It contains action, romance, trailer, scary and so on. Which can be suited to any taste. Perfect acting from Brando and Pacino, as well as Keaton, delights you."
10,The best movie of all time.,"To this day, I have never seen a work as well done, very well written, directed and acted as this one. Everything about this movie is perfect, both the atmosphere and the music. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie but I would watch it again if I had to.

The part where Michael knows Apollonia even though it is short is very well told. The film grips us from beginning to end. I love this movie as well as everyone's acting and I also love the second movie, I encourage all my friends to watch this masterpiece.

No other work will surpass this one, not even with the passage of time, I'm sure years and years will pass and everyone will remember this movie."
10,Just wow!!,Never thought I could enjoy a movie so much. Not into crime drama this just took my breath away!! A true masterpiece. That's what acting is all about. I wonder why I never got into it earlier.
10,Best gangster movie,An amazing drama. This kind of movies are made once every 100 years. An absolute masterpiece.
10,Glorified Criminals,"About: Criminals trying to whack other criminals while they are ignorant to their own bad behaviour.

Story: Boring. Empty. Disgusting.

Production: A good visual production ruined on deadly sins.

Main intelligent: 0. Everyone dropped out of Kindergarten, it seems.

UnWorthiness Level: 0

Should you watch this?: No. People will believe the hype and pop culture and pretend to like films like this. In reality, movies like these are garbage, toxic and unworthy. Based on a book or not you gotta ask the author where his head was when he wrote this type of toxic garbage.

Movies like this are only good when the Punisher clean house.

They massacred my brain."
2,Extremely overrated film,"I watched this film when I was a kid, then as a teenager, then twice as an adult. I watch a lot of classic films, foreign and domestic (US), and I am very open minded in my movie selection. Apart from the music score and somber and tragic mood in the film, I find tp be it very unappealing. The cinematography is wonderful, no doubt, but the story telling, script, and acting as mediocre. Marlon Brando's acting has always been overrated, I always heard Marlon Brando, this, Marlon Brando that, I saw 5 of his films and I never watched others. HE's got to be one of the worst actors that ever set foot on a set. Al Pacino acts like he is running on a 2 volt battery in this movie, and they're supposed to be Italians right? Mafia or otherwise Italians do not behave as they do in this movie, and this causes the film to lose credibility. Al Pacino is an amazing actor, my favorite, but in this movie he is mediocre. The Godfather is a great story but the film fails to glue me to the TV. Huge cast, wonderful music and cinematography, what a waste of talent."
10,"Truly, one of the greatest films ever made.","Francis Ford Coppola is certainly a respected name amongst the film industry, certainly due in part to Apocalypse now and The conversation (Maybe not dementia 13) but almost certainly for the Godfather trilogy. The first two films are peak cinema (The third isn't bad, but fails to reach the same heights.) with Coppola not being afraid to show the dark,gritty, ugly world of the Mafia. The Corelones are terrifying because they are such well-versed, attractive people. However, this is merely a front for their ruthless, uncompromising nature, turning on their so-called allies in a blink of an eye. There are many lessons in the film that are directly taken from Nicolas Machiaveli's The prince, regarding power, as well as a hint of Shakespeare's Macbeth. All these combine for a violent, dark, but artistic film, the likes of which may never be rivaled. Except maybe, by it's direct successor."
8,How i feel about the movie,"The Godfather is a very intense viewing experience. I really liked how they used the bottom lighting so he could not really see who was talking at the beginning, it left a sense of suspense about it. The suspense of what could this person's business be what is there business what do they do. Why are they coming to the Godfather for help? The other thing I really like about the film is how before he goes to get the gun from the bathroom to shoot the men in the restaurant. When he gets to the bathroom he takes the gun and has to calm himself down, then he goes to shoot the guys and hears the sound of a train right before he does it. I feel that the intensity of the train noise rising as he is about to shoot them was a brilliant choice of thing to do because it shows how he is thinking about it. I do not like how they used low lighting all the time. I get it is a dark type of movie but it does not need that type of lighting like all the time. They could have used neutral lighting because that is not light but not dark at the same time. I feel like that would have worked better because low lighting ended up making the scene look way darker than it had to be. The Godfather was a very good movie and overall it was a very nice movie with an amazing story-line. The way they portrayed most of it was amazing but when they overused some of the lighting is what made me kinda feel off about how some parts of the movie may not be that great. I did like a lot of the sounds in his head."
8,The best film I ever watched,"Yes they do deserve an Oscar please.

I'd definitely recommend you to watch The Godfather I've learned so much strength couldn't explain enough to you'all.

Thanks to imdb for letting me sharing my experience here.

Stay humble and fight just like how hard they worked and boom here we go you guys are doing an amazing jobs."
8,"good, but not the best.","I was entertained by the Godfather. A lot. So don't think that this is a negative review.

The godfather has kind of set it self up to be kind of like a joke now. Come on. ""Don't forget the canole!"" It is kind of stereotypical of Italians, even though Coppola himself was an Italian and didn't intend it to be that way. Marlon Brando is great, but he is still way overrated. Al Pacino, however, is amazing, and made me rethink my earlier opinion that he was an overactor. James Caan of course is great, as is Diane Keaton. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as Part Two, which is a masterpiece.

Oh, and one more thing... Nino Rota made the best score ever with this one.

7/10 Stars"

9,Awesome,"Every time I've seen that movie I only see him hitting her once... And it doesn't look like it was cut 🤔 Do not miss this film! The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?"
10,artwork,"Compared with the requirement for a literary work to have a sense of picture, the film directly presents the picture. Therefore, the movie can be enjoyed by both elegance and vulgarity, because the picture can be seen by everyone, and the rich soundtrack and soundtrack make the movie this art form Exudes infinite charm. But the movie itself has its own art form and creative technique. Reading the movie itself can better experience the charm of movie art."

10,masterpiece,The godfather trilogy is best movie of all time.everything in godfather is perfect. from directing to acting and soundtrack and everythig...
10,THE GODFATHER is perfect. Unbelievable performances. Outstanding direction. Strong dialog. Beautiful music.,"The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. It's perfect, or at least close to perfection. It is obviously overrated, but there's a reason it's like that.

The Godfather is perfect in many ways. First of, the acting. This is one of a few films in which brings amazing performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is obviously solid gold. The then 47-year-old nails it as the title character and offers an iconic, unforgettable performance that will always remain one of the strongest performances in movie history. Al Pacino succeeds as the ""nice college boy"" that changes strongly throughout the film. James Caan and Robert Duvall come strong as supporting characters, as well as Richard Castellano, Al Lettieri and Diane Keaton.

Francis Ford Coppola is one of the last great directors. His directing in The Godfather is brilliant and spectacular. The screenplay for the film is terrific. Many good and iconic lines, and great dialog. The music is beautiful. The main theme is bone chilling and the Love Theme is unique and a masterpiece. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the wedding party to Sicily, Italy, it's just breathtaking.

No matter how many years pass, I know for sure that The Godfather will always remain a strong and powerful film, and one of the most important films in motion picture history. Impossible to defeat, The Godfather really is the greatest film of all time."
9,Godfather's power,"This is how I watched the movie. I watched first 1 hour then left as such since I was bored. After 3 months, I watched the movie again, this time I could enjoy it very much. The movie is showing how powerful Godfather really is. No major plot twists or anything like that but it's a great gangster movie. The movie is made up of many independent scenes, the first scene itself is catching. Must watch, a little bit lagging if seen for the first time, yet a good movie."
10,A perfect movie,I mean where do i even start this without a doubt the greatest movie of all time and i really mean what i say this is like my 12 time watching this movie back and every time i fall in love with it even more the story the acting i really don't understand people who don't like it and often they say that they don't get it! I mean with all due respect if you can't appreciate how phenomenal this movie is then maybe the problem is in with you .
8,A great movie,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.

Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility."

10,The Godfather,El inicio de contar bien las grandes historias de los Gansters
9,i dont know really what to say about this masterpiece,"It is an iconic movie that I cannot expressly describe. It is one of the films that will not be repeated throughout history and the best epic drama films for me. Imagine with me a movie from the seventies that excels most of the films of our modern era in many respects, whether it is from the great music that lasted with us for more than 5 decades or from the great story that will not be repeated. Or about the terrible performance of the actors, especially the performance of Marlon Brando. It is a performance from another world. I liked the movie very much. And i can rewatch it soooooo many times."
8,One of the greats,"The Godfather is an incredible experience.

I can surely understand why critics put this movie at the top.

All of the performances done by the cast are incredible, they truly bring this movie to life. It's clear that the director and writer did their jobs brilliantly.

At the very start of the movie Marlon Brando gives out a powerful and emotional performance, making you wish that he was your Godfather.

Al Pacino is passed the torch at the middle of the movie, gaining more and more screen time, slowly becoming the star of the show.

This movie is an absolute pop culture hit. It has been referenced and continues to be referenced non stop throughout different types of media (movies,cartoons,tv series, etc...).

At it's time and for the next 30 years after it was released, it was probably THE best movie ever created.

It's certainly a classic and with a unbiased review I could easily give it a 10/10 if I was 20 years older and I grew up with this film.

If you live in the 21st century and for some reason you had not watched The Godfather like me, you will certainly have already seen most of the famous scenes and lines from the movie in one way or another.

Sadly watching this 50 years later has kind of ruined the delivery of those scenes for me.

In addition to that, this is a trilogy story, so the end does not really give it a satisfying conclusion. It does however give an amazing setup that makes you want more. My biased review is a harsh 8/10.

Summary: this movie is a must watch if you enjoy incredible quality cinema and very rich stories."
8,Iconic,"Rewatching the trilogy. Love the series.

We see Michael turn into everything that he was trying to avoid, but we're on his side even though he's a antihero.

Still amazes me that Simonetta Stefanelli was only 16 and doing a topless scene!

Can't wait to rewatch 2&3."
10,Amazing movie,The best gangster film. A great lesson of directing.
10,Best Movie,"Top notch performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and the rest of the cast and crew. Truly, the best picture of all time. 10 out of 10."
10,The Classical Legendary Masterpiece...,"Magnificent portrait of organized crime

This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..

Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.

This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
10,The Best,"I have to admit that although I have not had any information about the subject for many years, I would think that it would be a heavy future, and that I would face the film and such a thing. I do not think that it is such an exaggerated script, the impressive aspect of Filmin is not it. It was all over it. It was a great story that Michael, like Michael, turned himself into a character who could not feel his family's way of life, and that he had become his father over time. Brando's character was a legend in itself. If you're still watching, do not waste any time.I did not see such a heavy character. I regret that I watched too late. The work of the family was very well done. The tones of the auditions were all legendary. It was the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece of Cinema,"The Godfather is not just a crime film-it's a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it offers a deep, emotional look into family, power, and loyalty. Marlon Brando delivers an unforgettable performance as Don Vito Corleone, while Al Pacino's transformation as Michael is one of the most powerful character arcs in film history. Every scene is crafted with precision, from the dialogue to the haunting soundtrack by Nino Rota. The film's atmosphere, pacing, and symbolism elevate it to legendary status. Even decades later, The Godfather remains one of the greatest films ever made."
2,Times have indeed changed,"What helped Vito was loyalty, humanity, and a sense of honor. Times have changed, more things need to be balanced, and the direction of business is also adjusting, but in the gang, these things will not change. At the beginning of the second part, Frank came to Mike's son's birthday party and lamented, ""There are so many musicians, but none of them are Italian."" Mike became stubborn in the end and didn't trust anyone. This may have something to do with his brother. Fredo betrays himself. But Mike's incomplete trust in Tom was obvious from the beginning, even if he explained that it was because he didn't want Tom to be hurt, but trust or not, someone with a special status like Tom would be more sensitive. There is a section in the book that talks about how the old godfather used some methods to make Tom feel that he was fully trusted, but Mike obviously did not do this."
10,The best ever,"Between the incredible story, superb acting and a musical score 2nd to none this is the one all others should be measured by. No one has done it better before or since. Coppola mastered, under incredible pressure, not only the interpretation of a best selling novel, but he was brave enough to fight for his casting choices. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan and Cazale were never better or even equal to their performances in ""the Godfather"". Pacino fans may say ""Scarface"" was more of a tour de force, but to see the subtle change in Michael Corleone from pacifist war hero to cold-hearted killer is acting at it's finest. I have recommended ""The Godfather"" to a number of 20-something friends trying to imagine what their reactions would be. To a person, all have sung it's praises, proving the everlasting quality of ""The Godfather""."
10,Viewing is definitely recommended.,"Classics can be seen as old, intimidating, mostly black and white movies... The Godfather doesn't even glimpse at those characteristics, in contrast, it not only enthralls the audience, but also inspires other films relating to its topic. The 1940s revolved around a tone that was dark, and uninviting to sympathy, while The Godfather actually triggers extreme emotion towards the, otherwise seen as, ""bad guys.""

Characters that are seriously stereotyped take a new spin and actually make the viewer feel involved in the events of the movie. Michael, an army man in search of pure separation from his family and the family business, is in love with Kay, a young girl full of life and enthusiasm for Michael. While his older brother struggles to keep the family name intact.

The characters themselves shine in the light of a great story, full of excitement and suspense. Talks of war between families and the spread of drugs and gambling keep the viewer interested throughout the long film. The viewer is hopelessly involved with the family, having had no interaction with any real people or in conversations.

The Godfather is timeless with awesome actors and angles, the subject matter is rather heavy and it should be seen by parents before viewing by children. It is definitely a ten on a scale where that rates the highest."
9,Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.,"The plot is not complicated, but it gives people a profound impression inadvertently."
10,Hall Of Fame,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.

One of the best of all times."
10,Just love it...,"I love this movie. The cast, the script, the cinematography, the direction. A true masterpiece. If you like mafia related movies this should be at the top of your watch list."
10,The GREATEST Movie of All Time!!!!,"I will not hesitate to call The Godfather the GREATEST movie OAT . Since 1972 there is no movie greater than this ultimate divine Masterpiece . If cinema is a mountain Godfather is its peak . Nothing after that even came near to the greatness of The Godfather. It's simply divine in every single way . The acting , soundtrack , story/plot , cinematography everything is PERFECT. It has a strange magic in it . That cannot be described.

Overall the movie is both a great , unforgettable and entertaining ride and a masterpiece that stood with test of time . So far , nothing came close to it."
10,True to life,Real life mob movie captures true to life life Mob crime. Very detailed with great acting! Superb cast! Definitely will leave you wanting to learn more. This movie sparked a Hollywood interest and paved the way for several other mob movies to hit the scene. Many of these actors are so convincing with their mob look and talk that they have starred in several other mob movies. With movies still being released to this date featuring some of these very actors. These movies feed into Americas fascination with the mob and keep people wanting to see more. If you are just starting into mob movies this movie is definitely the mob movie you must start with!
10,The quintessential film,"""The Godfather"" is not only the greatest crime drama ever made, it is true perfection in every cinematic aspect. Coppola's directing is flawless, the performances and casting could not have been better, and the story based on Mario Puzo's novel is incredible in its intricate portrayal of a number of years during the twilight reign of an aging mafia Don, as he begins to disassemble his leadership over the family's business affairs and hand them over to his sons in the midst of an all-out war between New York City's Mafia families.

The editing is superb as there is not one scene in the film that is over or under done in any way. Indeed, every minute of the film is perfect, and I do not say that lightly. It is an extraordinary achievement and the confidence that Coppola demonstrates here cannot be understated. He masterfully moves the story from America to Sicily, and through the years without any blatant indication. Unlike what was to come in its wake, ""The Godfather"" manages to be violent but never gratuitous, which adds to its beauty and reinforces the point that what we are watching is splendid and perfect film-making. There is so much going on in the story, and plenty to watch out for, that it is a film you can watch and enjoy time and time again. The cinematography is breath-taking, the music strong and poignant, and when the going gets tough, it is very suspenseful and your heart will be beating rapidly. It is not only the quintessential crime film, but it is, as many polls and lists will tell you time and time again, the quintessential film. A riveting crime saga, a powerful family drama, and a nerve-shattering character study as we watch the fall of one Don, and the rise of another."
10,G. O. A. T Godfather!,"I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience.

MASTERPIECE!"
10,Perfect balance,"Considered by many as ""the best film in history"", 'The Godfather' has earned a prestige and respect over the years, something fully deserved. To speak of 'The Godfather' is to speak of a perfect balance, a masterful balance between an epic Gangsters story, a powerful family drama and a man's personal conflict. All these themes are carried by Coppola in such a fluid way that nothing ends up feeling forced within the story. And although it is true, there are a large number of plots, characters and relationships, the aforementioned fluidity of the narrative, added to a technical perfection to tell the story, causes all these elements to have an impact on the narrative, which is pretty intuitive. Each factor is decisive and influences history, something that every filmmaker aspires to achieve, but that no one can say has achieved as Coppola. It is difficult to define cinematographic perfection, but if this were a conflict that encompasses all its characters and that all the factors play in order to tell the story in the best possible way, then we can consider that 'The Godfather' is a perfect work."
10,A piece of anthology !!!,This Movie is a work of art that is both past and contemporary. A family story. A tragic story. A piece of Italian American history. Beautiful and timeless.
9,The best movie of all times!,"I'm Italian myself just learning to speak English. I know what real mafia is and this movie brought tears to my eye's. My name is the big ""T"" because of my size. I Think... No I Know that Italians are the best actors. Just look at the movie. Robert Deniro, Al Pacino, Marlin Brando, and Robert Duval. Even though he is Irish Italians made him the actor he is today. To end this on a happy note. Anybody who disliked this movie should be sleeping with the fishes. Gratzi."
10,Best film? Not likely... But it is filmmaking at its definite peek!,"I have seen many films far more ambitious in their scope and execution, I have seen more than a dozen films that made far more important statements about the world, and I have seen films that moved me far beyond anywhere The Godfather could have moved me. But can the greatness of this film really be denied by anyone with even a vague knowledge about the filmmaking process? To call this film garbage is idiocy, there is no excuse, anyone who might make such a statement obviously has no clue about movies, even if they try to state otherwise. Despite the fact that in many ways it glamorizes the criminal life, The Godfather is the peek of excellence in film. It's a shame that people buy into the gangster formula created by Hollywood, it's a worse shame that people expect it, and when they do not see it they demand it! This film breaks out of the formula, and it does so shamelessly, but it doesn't do it thoughtlessly. There are truly excellent ironic statements all throughout the film, it surprises me that some people who claim to have some knowledge about film miss them. The baptism that Michael Corleone attends is just one example, the shots of the baptism are juxtaposed with intercut shots of brutal killings taking place at approximately the same time, killings that were ordered by Michael as he took over the ""family business"". It's a very powerful scene, almost revolting, it creates a very definite question mark as to the glamorous nature of the first part of the film. Once again, this is far from the greatest film, but it's a definite 10 - there is no question about it."
10,The godfather is my favourite film forever,Everytime my favourite film. I watched 2k times. The godfather is arguably the best drama ever. What stands out most in the movie is Italy's old town architecture and shooting techniques.old but gold.
10,Masterpiece of the XX century,"The Godfather is the most memorable, most influential, most quoted, most beloved, most discussed, most imitated, most revered and most entertaining American movie ever made."
10,greatest classic,"Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film.The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry.The Writing was awesome.I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."
10,Pure Genius!!,"An instant classic...marvelous acting, beautiful cinematography, and a perfect musical score. Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is possibly the greatest film ever made. Simply riveting from beginning to end. This movie stands the test of time, even more than 30 years later. The epic saga of the Corleone family is the first and only movie of it's genre to win best picture. A must for your DVD collection.

10/10"
10,True to life,"There's nothing more to say than that the acting was outstanding. Seeing stars like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall might still captivate audiences today. For a movie enthusiast, this is like paradise. Brando managed to re-establish his prominence with this film. His portrayal of the godfather on his own is legendary. His persona has been imitated in movies so frequently that it has practically become a cliché. However, his performance was not cliched. His performance was amazing and understated. It was arguably even more real and authentic than Marlon Brando himself because of how true to life it was."
10,Master,"To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.

Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility."
9,wow,"Just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an"
5,SO GOOD,This film is the best ever!. I have never watched a film so well produced!
10,My favorite movie,"The best movie I have ever seen, it is a very, very great movie.. The actors' performances, the cinematography, the directing, and the wonderful soundtrack. It is a very beautiful and legendary movie, and one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. The actor Marlon Brando gave a legendary performance, thank you. Also, the actor Al Pacino gave a terrible and wonderful performance that deserves applause. Thank you, legend, and thank you to all the great cast. It is really a movie that deserves to be watched, and one of the best movies. A beautiful story, wonderful dialogue, and beautiful actors. Thank you all."
10,the mob,Brilliant work must see for see for this film will never and shall never get old
9,Never bored to watch it again,"It is one of the iconic movies that come only once in a while with a package full of old movies nostalgia, family affairs, social relations, and a great script that you can not get bored of and can watch as many times as you want.

Many generations have watched this movie even though it passes their trend and lifestyle and it got the best reviews mostly from the newer generation which means its story and action are accurate for many people.

Another side of the movie is that it is as realistic as it possibly be, said that it has its kind of dark realistic side with killing the enemies and the way of doing it and the emotions accompanyed by it."
10,One of the greatest,"The Godfather is the film is ready to watch for me every couple months or less. Amazing on how our past existed with the best that care for their families, and people that respect them forever. Likely my favorite movie of all time."
9,this film makes me love old generation,This film makes me love this generation all details all things makes this film iconic
10,What Can i say? The Best,"What can you say about this? This is close to a ""perfect movie"" The direction was perfect. The casting, the script, the drama, the editing all Superb.

Watching Al Pacino as Micheal literally changing his ""personna"" throughout the course of this story is awesome.

And of course this was ""Brando's"" finest hour. Also the score and editing were perfect.

The effects were done masterfully. James Cann's portrayal of the ""Hot Tempered"" Sonny was stunning.

An absolute MUST for every movie collection!"
10,an offer you can't refuse,"This is, undoubtedly, THE classic movie of all time, and seems to set a standard for lines, effects, acting, action, and all other basic elements connected with any movie. With all due respects to the outstanding and late actor Marlon Brando, it was more than just he who made the movie an outstanding success, though he was convincing as the usually-calm yet almost-always cold, controlling don Vito Corleone The nostalgia effects were superb: it was not the least bit difficult to imagine what NYC was like between 1945 and 1955. (1971 NYC was ""turned into"" the NYC of the time setting of the story.) James Caan was as mean as mean could be in his role as the godfather Vito Corleone's son Santino, (Sonny) and Al Pacino, as the don's youngest and favorite son Michael Corleone, had his career launched in just this movie. Of course, Diane Keaton proved to be a promising future star in her role as Kay Adams at her young age of about twenty-five. The story came across as a story of, in my personal opinion, how NOT to live. (Of course, some would disagree with me one hundred per cent on that.) This in-depth study of the Mafia (though the word ""mafia"", as the case was supposed to be, was never used) was definitely a convincing view of the underworld with, among other things, the ""eye-for-eye"" mindset. To recapitulate, the nostalgia, the action, the acting, and the story itself made it THE great feat for Hollywood for all time. Paramount Studios, the director Francis Ford Coppola, and the producer Albert S. Ruddy should be proud."
10,I love this!,I love how the lead actor portrays his role in this movie and how the story unfolds in the plot. The twists of the story is breathtaking. Being a head of the family is not easy indeed especially in the wish of the Father to hand over his position. Mafia stories are controversial buy this one is a unique one and takes our attention to the focus of the good part of the story. I love how I can relate to the side of the son who wants a different path. Being asked to be the next generation leader is not an easy one and it makes my heart cries how the relationship goes into not to good but this story is amazingly awesome.
10,Perfect!,"It´s perfect ! good script, casting, acting! It´s perfect ! good script, casting, acting! It´s perfect ! good script, casting, acting!"
9,The scale of achievement is such that it not only defined the image of gangster culture in the popular consciousness but also influenced real gangsters and mafiosi to imitate,"The scale of achievement is such that it not only defined the image of gangster culture in the popular consciousness but also influenced real gangsters and mafiosi to imitate the film's characters in style and manner of speech. Francis Ford Coppola admitted that he did very little actual research into the gangster culture and that to him the film was a stylistic ""modern myth"" about the Italian-American immigration experience."
10,great raffia movie,"I believe the Godfather is the greatest film all time. Marlon Brando, who at first wasn't interested to play Don Vito Corleone, put down his most stunning performance ever. The characteristics, the voice of Brando match perfect with the some kind of mysterious Vito Corleone. This film is also the real start of the career of Al Pacino. After he played Michael Corleone, he was immediately given the role of young cop Serpico one year later in 1973. The best actors of two following eras meet here in this film. But the Godfather is more than just Brando or Pacino. We must certainly not forget the brilliant performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, all Oscar nominated. John Cazale playing Fredo Corleone stays a bit in the background. I liked him better in part 2. Francis Ford Coppola puts all this great actors together in a beautiful whole."
10,Top Gangbanger Movie Homie,"It's an awesome movie with chilling detail, keeps you on the edge of your seat and inspiring at the same time"
9,Amazing,I love it. Marlon Brando is a very nice actor and his interpretation is very very amazing. Nice movie.
10,On repeat,"Watch it once and you'll watch it again!

Incredible direction, amazing talented cast and a story line that gives you goosebumps. Pacino, Deniro and Brando made their mark on this film in so many ways.

Francis Ford Coppola goes down in history as one of the best writers.

An underworld of mafia and culture that is based on a true story. Criminals doing what they do best. Aligned with Italian mafia. It was shot in so many destinations and being able to capture the essence of history.

Each time you view the movie, you will want to watch it again and again. The way it is filmed it is so captivating and well put together, you are unable to fault it."
4,Overvalued.,"I had great expectations on this trilogy because of everybody says it was good.

Definitely , they seemed rubbish the 3 of them to me.

Long and boring.

Besides i got lost with so many characters and actions so i had to rewind the movie so many times that i spend much more time than usual viewing this film.

All for you, because to me is a F*****G S**T.

PS: I don't understand how can i be the only one who doesn't like this movies although i am a great movie fan."
9,Excellent Movie Till Date,"Excellent Movie Till Date Hi This is Sabrina Akter Organic SEO Specialist, Digital Marketer. L just love movies. So that I am here to give ratings and reviews too.

10,Epic,"Great film, great sound track (score). The characters, Michael C, and Sonny C beautiful acting. The casting was second to none. Should be used as an example of how to make films as part of a film making course"
10,All Time Favorite,"In my view, this is not a gangster of crime inspiration film. I like this film about acting and cinematography. Brilliant work by actors and director. I think this film has the capacity for new generation moviemakers."
5,Finest theatrical experience,"The finest mafia film and the finest family i have ever watched. The craft of cinema is at its best in godfather series.Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino)."
10,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. Released in 1972","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. Released in 1972, this epic crime drama continues to captivate audiences with its compelling storytelling, impeccable performances, and iconic moments.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of the enigmatic Don Vito Corleone is a tour de force, earning him an Oscar for Best Actor. The film's narrative weaves a complex web of family loyalty, power struggles, and moral dilemmas within the Corleone mafia dynasty.

The cinematography, particularly Gordon Willis's moody and atmospheric lighting, sets the tone for the film's dark and brooding ambiance. Nino Rota's haunting score adds depth to the storytelling.

""The Godfather"" is a profound exploration of the human condition, ethics, and the corrupting influence of power. It's a film that continues to be celebrated and studied, reminding us of the enduring impact of cinema as an art form. A true classic that stands the test of time."
10,Awesome,"Awesome experience watching this movie. must watch films for the people who like suspense genre. all the actors made justice to their characters. with all available resources that time (1972), the films technical properties are up to the mark."
10,The Godfather,"First movie ever that catched me like no other one! That atmosphere is so thrilling and sharp, my nerves driven over! No words can describe this epic film. Must see. But only 1 an 2! Part 3 is not - in my opinion - The Godfather. Love"
10,"A Cinematic Masterpiece and Epic tale of Power, Loyalty, and Betrayal","Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an enduring cultural landmark that reshaped the gangster genre and set a new standard for storytelling. It changed the image of the Italian American immigrant Story. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film dives deep into the lives of the Corleone family. It offers a powerful narrative about power, loyalty, and family in the American Mafia.

At the heart of this epic is Marlon Brando's legendary portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, a role that has become iconic in film history. Brando's quiet, restrained power is mesmerizing, commanding every scene he's in with that Iconic Chin. Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, delivers a transformative performance, evolving from a reluctant outsider to the ruthless leader of the family..

The film's pacing is deliberate, taking time to immerse viewers in its richly textured world of Italian/Sicilian American Culture of the 50's. Coppola masterfully balances grand, operatic set-pieces with intimate, character-driven moments, creating a perfect blend of tension and drama. The cinematography, with its rich shadows and iconic lighting, adds a sense of realism to every frame, giving the film a timeless quality.

Nino Rota's haunting score elevates the film, underscoring the tragic beauty and brutality of the Corleone family's rise to power.

The film doesn't just glorify crime; it examines the personal and moral costs of the characters' actions, making the audience question the true price of ambition and power.

The Godfather isn't just a movie; it's an epic. From its unforgettable dialogue to its twist in plot, it is a masterclass in filmmaking that remains just as captivating today as it was over five decades ago.

A timeless classic that continues to influence cinema and stands as the greatest film of all time for me."
10,Best ever,"Francis Ford Coppola brings to life one of the greatest crime novels ever, portraying Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, one of the best performances ever.

The Godfather is head of organized crime, run by his family, and is a very 'reasonable' man. He offers help to anyone who comes to him, expecting in return, only friendship. His denial to accept a narcotics deal gets him shot and although he survives, things are never the same again, with constant attempts to murder the bedridden Godfather. It is at this time when the family is losing power, that Michael Corleone, another brilliant performance by Al Pacino, slowly rises to power within the family. The rest is history."
5,The Greatest Movie,"The Godfather is among the hardly any films that does not have one flaw. Seeing The Godfather for The very first time was one of the most amazing Motion picture activities of my daily life. There is scenes that stay with you when the films over, therefore you remember them. Anyone can make the mistake of calling this film a Motion picture about criminal offense. Its definitely a Film about relatives. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I have observed the Film a minimum of 30, forty instances, and I'm nonetheless stunned at how excellent it is. The tunes, the performing, every little thing. Folks think that Citizen Kane is the greatest Motion picture at any time produced...perfectly, there's no way that ANYONE can believe Citizen Kane is a lot more moving, and it has a greater storyline compared to the Godfather. The matter I locate so astounding concerning the Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) improvements throughout the movie. Its my impression this is the greatest movie ever designed, and I doubt that any one can look at this Motion picture, and Believe I am ridiculous."
10,"Simple perfection, more about acting than anything else.","This movie is absolute perfection, and now that it is out on DVD, it is something that must be owned. If you haven't seen it then make it a point to do so. It is amazing that this movie was made in just 62 days. The acting in this is fantastic, and worthy of the highest praise, this movie can be nothing less than a 10."
8,GOOD MOVIE,"Its one of the famous movies, its good, and it with al pacino and james caan. With famous quotes.

Although This movie is long (3 hours) it doesnt feel long."
10,Simply spectacular,"Simply brilliant, it tells the sad truth that circulates in some places. This film shows how the mafia works in all its brutality, for a 1977 film it is still a current story. The soundtrack is unforgettable, well composed and goosebumps, the plot is engaging and full of twists, truly a masterpiece. I'll be watching Part 2 and Part 3 shortly and can't wait."
10,this movie that made me love cinema.,"I watched this movie for the first time in 2018 and i enjoyed watching it a lot, which made me repeat it five times the godfather icon can not watch like it after 1 000,000 years"
10,nice,This film is amazing and is a must watch. Any one who may have seen goodfellas may like this also.
10,The greatest movie ever made,"The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. The acting by the legendary Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone is the greatest male performance in movie history. The supporting cast of Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton started their legendary careers with this film, their first important work in a major epic film.

The Godfather is not a simple gangster movie. It is a movie about family. The family just happens to be made up of gangsters. But even in the terrible underworld there is morality amongst this group. they do not kill arbitrarily. The Godfather himself is reluctant to get into the world of narcotics and it almost cost him his life.

The script by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is extraordinary, as is Coppola's direction. The attention to detail of Italian culture is superb. From beginning to end you will be riveted by the interaction of the Corleone family, as well as the Corleone ""family"".

Don't miss the greatest movie ever made"
10,Marvelous,"Marvelous, no words. The director, the cinematography were perfect. The best film."
3,Did not care for the movie,"I didn't like it, it takes too long getting into, and it insists upon itself, it really tries hard at that. Everybody says how it's like the perfect movie, but I just couldn't get into it. Haven't even seen the ending. I try on many occasions to try to watch it, but I just can't do it, people are just sitting around talking about something that I can't, and haven't been able to, follow for what I think would probably have been the rest of the movie until then. I like the Money Pit, that's all I'll say about this movie. Since I am not at the required number of characters left, I'll just leave it on this."
10,10/10,Monumental. The best of its kind and the apex for both Coppola and Pacino. A must see.
10,An Institution itself,The Godfather is my utmost favorite movie. I have watched it numbers of times and i always learn from it. its an institution for me. Thanks A lot
10,Best film of all time,"This movie is a definitely best movie. Everything includes in this movie are just perfect. The acting, the theme, the score, the Cinematography and the lighting, I can't write it's greatness. I watched this film 10 months ago but I still can talk about the scenes without any mistake. I watched yesterday but if I watch today it still gonna be cinematic classic for me."
10,An Icon,"At once an observant homage to crime films of the Thirties and Forties and a loving portrait of an Italian-American family, Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's superlative novel (Puzo also co-write the script) is an achievement few films can hope to approximate. Coppola, along with his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, and his production designer, Dear Tavoularis, have created a history wholly realized, burnished brown as if a memory that will never completely fade. The world of the Cosa Nostra they present is closed and stuffy which provides an intimacy that generates an extraordinary amount of warmth and a feeling of lives being affected. The cast is flawless: the actors, to a person, inhabit the characters with such understanding and affection that they will be forever associated with them. (Al Pacino as Michael in the trilogy will never be able to match this work elsewhere.) But it is Marlon Brando in the title role that delivers such devastating work that you can only sit and stare in wonderment. Brando has a presence wise beyond his years and his gentle, thoughtful manner is never once betrayed his calculating, violent acts. Every movement, every vocal inflection is detailed and planned but he offers a spontaneity that never reveals technique. Guided by Coppola's abiding dedication to realism, Brando pushes this film to icon status. Not to be missed."
10,Greatest movie of all time,I thought this movie was a masterpiece is definitely better then part 2
10,All time best,One of the best movie I have ever watched. This is a significant change in Hollywood Industry. Must watch this movie before you die.
10,timeless masterpiece,"This movie may have comes out 25 years before i was born, but recently my mom came home with the 40th anniversary edition. I just finished watching the first and second film, they are amazing i just can't stop talking about them. I love the power games there is between everyone. Im not much for gangster or action films, but this really got to me. It was amazing to watch it on blue ray the light was perfect. I enjoyed every little part of this film, and didn't seem to noticed it lasted almost 3 hours. I don't ever write reviews but this was a film i think everyone should watch, its a timeless masterpiece which I'm sure would could be enjoyed by many in my generation. And the acting is superb, but Al never seems to disappoint me."
8,ONE WORD BRILLIANT,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them. BRILLIANT FOR ME 8/10"
9,A movie deserving of it's IMDB ranking,"While this isn't my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in my top 10. I've probably seen this movie a half dozen times, but I recently watched it again for the first time in about 15 years. If you haven't seen it lately, it's worth watching again."
10,THE BEST Mafia film of the century,One of the only films I have seen that is perfect in every regard.... The Godfather revolutionized the gangster/mafia movie sub-genre and changed filmmaking forever! Would give 11/10 if I could.
10,Coppola's Masterpiece,"Wow! When I came out the Godfather for the first time that was first thing I said, wow. I guess that one word can mean a lot of things but to me it was just short for 'this movie is amazing and I've never seen anything like it ever and I'm glad I can say that i've watched it'. The problem was, the first time I watched it, I had to asked my dad half the time what the hec these guys were talking about or who was killing who'. But the second time I watched it, I understood every word and really got into it. Cause, it's a classic and I'm that kind of person who loves to watch some of those great old films like On the Waterfront or the French Connection. And the The Godfather wasn't like any of them. The story was amazing and god forbid the fantastic dialogue but I think that the film's strong point is the acting. Well, when you've got Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall attached to a movie then you kind of already know it's gonna be amazing. And it was. Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for playing the extremely iconic role of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan all deserved there nominations as well. Personally, I don't think there's anything really wrong with this film. The cinematography is wonderful, I've mentioned the acting and the writing, the costumes are superb and the violence is as brutal as it is compelling. If you have the time, then watch this masterpiece."
10,One of the three best movies ever made,"The Godfather is one of the two or three best movies ever made, A skillfully crafted movie that looks into the heart of a mob family. Micheal is a war hero wanting to stay out of the family business untill his father is shot, After that all bets are off, Al Pacino gives a calm yet chilling preformance as Mike. Well written the movie zips along with no dull parts. 10 out of 10"
10,My mental build up film.,I never seen the film like this. Every one should seen this film before any carer making choice.
10,Calling this film excellent would be selling it short.,"The Godfather set the standard for how to make a great movie. It masterfully develops Michael Corleone's character throughout the film without ever rushing it-transforming him from a morally grounded war veteran into a ruthless mafia boss who would do anything to protect what he has, or at least what he has left. The movie shows us how a man can change, no matter what point in life he's at, because of the environment he's thrown into. An absolute masterpiece that has inspired millions of works of fiction-both those already made and those still being created today. Without a doubt you can say that this film started the new era of cinema."
10,We have not better than this movie !,"""Godfather"" is really perfect , we have no better than this movie and you should watch it more than 1000000000 times!"
10,An offer you can't refuse,"The tagline says it all. The perfect movie in every way. It contains fantastic drama, a little bit of action, a little romance and the story of a family that can never be forgotten!

If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on the best movie in movie history."
10,One of the Best Movies,It's really a good movie that makes you interact with the Events.
10,God Father Review,"I would like to start with a thank you,

Thank you, thank you, thank you for making this classic.

By far the best motion picture i've seen, Lighting, Actors, Mood, Locations, Writing, Cinematography, Direction, Edit & Execution. Hands down it is a prefect movie in every shape of the word. The moment i began watching this movie it took me in, i'm not Italian but felt proud to be a Latin American after watching this because of the amount of pride and value the writer gave to these characters, the love of family is one that i can relate to being from a Hispanic family. Many similarities in the way we conduct our lives.

Building up the Godfather, with the dramatic lighting, long cuts, the sense of realism as if you were there at the wedding says so much about the director. The roll of the god father must have been a hard roll to fill and execute, but Marlon Brando murdered it. He is nothing like any of his movies in the past. The embodiment of this character is one to remember. Hollywood needs more movies like this to be released in 2016 and 2017.

I'll be waiting..."
5,Great great movie!,It's a great classic. I was small when the movie premiered. I was able to watch it 10 years later and I don't regret it. It's a great experience. I looked at all the parts and I can recommend it to anyone.
10,Inspired Somany Film Makers..,"All Time Favourite. Inspiring many other films, still the godfather always the king of somany films."
10,Great movie,Much Entertainment Me. THIS MOVIES IS SO FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE . I know.
10,Emotionally excellent,This movie manipulates the human psycology with an excellent way
10,Masterpiece,"A real masterpiece; beautiful shots, great story and a good cast."
10,Godfather,"All I can say is that after almost fifty years there still is not a better movie showing how the true old school way of the Italian mob at its best could not have been any better Actor or Actresses to play all the parts in this movie. I have seen all the Mob, gangster or movies having to do with these types of setting like Goodfellas, Scarface, Billy Bath Gate to name a few and nothing comes close. a true Homerun and for sure a MUST SEE!"
10,"Real power cannot be given, it can be taken...","The Mafia and its real power... Respect and reputation for you as a person and the value of your word.

Good evening, dear ladies and gentlemen. Before that, I wrote a fascinating review about what is so necessary for every person in our time. Come in, I'm sure you'll like it here. I happened to watch the Godfather movie... Advantages: Great actors Al Pacino and Marlon Brandon, an excellent plot, a wonderful musical composition, an intrigue that captures and does not let go during the entire viewing.

Disadvantages: No. In my opinion, this film is not a propaganda of the cult of brave and strong guys who were allowed everything, without consequences and punishment. I saw in it an attempt by Francis Ford Coppola to show how one strong, determined and strong-willed person can make completely different people, honest and immoral, principled and indifferent, become one whole, harmoniously working organism, clearly pursuing a certain goal - absolute power. Not the one that sits in Congress, but the real one - on the streets, solving daily topical issues.

Perhaps this is one of the best roles not only of Marlon Brando, but also of the young Al Pacino. It is precisely such a hero, brave and determined, a man who broke the law, but at the same time remained a man, that he will be remembered by me for the rest of my life. All other roles in other films just fade away against the background of this game - a real game of life.

There are no homegrown special effects in the film, many scenes are played out in the old classic way, with the help of scenery and extras, and the picture only benefits from this, because we become witnesses to a real life story that we begin to believe. All the feelings are so sharp and real that if the main character loves, I also begin to love, hates, and this terrible feeling is transmitted to me.

The film exposed, in my opinion, the most terrible and obvious problems of modern society, which are relevant to this day. No matter how strong the vertical of power is, it will never be able to protect each of its citizens, ensure the rule of law and justice, and then a person begins to fill the vacuum of power on the ground with other laws - force and authority.

I would also like to mention the excellent musical accompaniment that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the film. The main melody has become a real hit and is recognizable all over the world. I am not a fan of the idea that any problems need to be solved, and if it does not work out peacefully, then by force, but our society has not yet come up with anything better than a more effective way. For my part, I would like to recommend this film as a real established classic of cinematography."
10,An Epic Masterpiece That Defines Cinematic Greatness - 10/10,"""The Godfather"" stands as an unparalleled cinematic achievement that transcends mere storytelling to become a cultural phenomenon and a benchmark for excellence in filmmaking. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this 1972 classic has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films in history.

At the core of ""The Godfather"" is the gripping narrative of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan led by the patriarch, Vito Corleone, portrayed flawlessly by Marlon Brando. The film weaves a complex and morally ambiguous tale of power, loyalty, and the consequences of choices made in the pursuit of the American Dream."
9,classic gangster film,"I know this film is classic gangster film becasuse good scene and characters, story."
10,The greatest classic of all time,"For me, this film is the standard of what a film should be in general. I never use superlative words, but here is the perfect direction, the perfect script, the perfect acting, the perfect music. Until now (and it's been 36 years), in my opinion, nothing has been shot in the genre of ""gangster thriller"", not only superior, but even close in quality. It's not a movie -it's life. You can watch it endlessly, and with each viewing discover some new details, circumstances, thoughts. At one time I watched it endlessly, in Russian and in English, and read the book, and in general I was a real fan, which almost never happens to me. Now I prefer films that are less bloody, but I take my hat off to the creator.

In general, what to say. Everyone has probably already watched it. And who hasn't watched yet - throw everything - and to the screen!"
9,the film is very good the script is good every moment in the film is interesting,the film is very good the script is good every moment in the film is interesting and all series the god father is cool and learning some thing. this film made is 1972 that why i m very impressed and congrats the all team the god father film very intelligently play and really script is good my salute to writer who believe in the film every second .so i m so glad to watch this movie and watching again and learning some different.
10,AMAZING,Such an amazing film highly recommend to everyone! its such a classic a must to watch
2,A multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
10,"Brilliant, Best Movie Ever","I've seen nearly 40 of the top 50 films on the AFI list, and although I'm no authoritarian on the subject I say without a doubt this is the most profound film in memory. If not for the fact that this movie is about Italians, better yet corrupt ones this would have been #1 on any virtually any reputable list. Everything comes together, there is no flaw. Citizen Kane was also brilliant, but it had flaws. How often is there a Godfather reference on tv? in a conversation? I can talk to anyone for hours about this film. This is the standard, this is the benchmark."
10,Seminal Masterpiece,"Everyone knows that ""The Godfather"" is a classic. I'm not saying anything new or adding to the conversation by stating the obvious. Today marks the third time in my life that I've watched ""The Godfather"" and each time I glean more and more, and each time I appreciate it more and more. At just under three hours long it was a chore to watch when I was younger.

We used to have a smallish collection of movies on VHS when I was growing up. Of them, I distinctly remember ""Gandhi,"" ""Lion of the Desert,"" and ""The Godfather"" as being long movies. I loved ""Lion of the Desert"" as a kid simply because of the war aspect (I need to rewatch it), while ""Gandhi"" and ""The Godfather"" used to put me to sleep.

If you're wondering how I was even allowed to watch ""The Godfather"" as a kid, I wasn't, but I would sneak and watch whatever we had on VHS. Whenever I tired of the movies I'd seen a dozen times already I would pop in one of the adult titles (meaning ""R"" rating or any movie with a plot too boring for an elementary school child). So I tried my hand at ""The Godfather,"" among other titles, and found myself struggling to follow all the dialogue and slow developing plot.

I watched ""The Godfather"" again as an early twenty-something and found a true appreciation of it, but I still didn't catch on to the depth of the story.

Watching it again at nearly fifty-years-old, I could truly appreciate the story as it chronicled the broad, as well as nuanced, operation of the Italian mafia with a focus on the Corleone family. The most standout characters and performances were that of Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone.

Like I said, I'm sure every superlative has been used already to describe ""The Godfather."" I'll just add that Director Francis Ford Coppola outdid himself with this seminal masterpiece. It's a film that will live on in cinematic lore and deserves its place as one of the best movies of all time.

10,The Best Film Ever,"GQ Magazine once had a cover story saying ""why can't more women look like Gyeneth Paltrow"". I say why can't more film's be like The Godfather. The film that revatalised Marlon Brando's career and set Al Pacino and Robert Duvall on two of the most successful film career's ever.In terms of atmosphere it has yielded on of the greatest scenes in cinematic and atmospheric history. I am of course referring to the scene in Lou's Diner (which was, sadly, recentely torn down). Channel 4 (UK) ran a poll of the ""100 greatest movies ever"". The Godfather was second to some film about Mark Hamill and a beam sword. In my clearly unbiassed opinion The Best Film Ever"
10,The Godfather of movies,"I was very late to see this one. But once I watched I got to know ""Why"" it's the Best . Actually it should be at the top.The music, writing, screenplay , dialogue everything is so perfect. I don't know few people say part-1 is better than the other two parts but for me all three parts were best as per the story was going, no doubt first godfather has some supreme actors that's the real fact that makes 1st part a bit edge to win."
10,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather.","Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.

We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens."
9,Spectacular! For the older crowd,"`The Godfather' is a spectacular movie, for the older crowd. Between a quotable script, great theme music, and a fabulous main character, this film will keep the viewer wondering.

While watching `The Godfather', the viewer may recognize many lines. Some of examples of those could be, ` I'll give em an offer he can't refuse,' or `Take it to the mattresses.' Simply the fact that lines from the movie are well known, proves that this movie is worthy of watching.

Throughout the movie, the same music is played over and over, but in different styles. For example, if someone is about to get shot, the music speeds up, and almost gets scary. When a happy time comes, the music gets softer, and more legato.

Finally, one of the best things about this movie is the main character. Al Pacino plays Michael, the child of the original Godfather. After his father gets shot in a mob hit, Michael, takes over the family business, and completely changes who from the person he used to be. Al Pacino is very believable in this role.

Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a 9 out of 10. It is definitely a movie worth seeing, but leave the kids at their friends, there is more gore than many would like."
10,The best,This is the best crime mafia movie ever and have the best punchlines as well.
10,The Acting,Phenomenal acting by all cast members. It really illustrates some part of the world we live especially when it comes the Italian Mafia. Nothing more to say about it other than The God Father was the pinaccle of flawless films.
10,Great movie,"Really loved watching it. Will definitely watch it again and again.

A must-see/a smash hit a box-office success/failure an audience pleaser well worth seeing not to be missed a moving production/an emotionally strong film a truly great piece of filmmaking a skillful piece of filmmaking an impressive debut a very moving portrayal I definitely recommend this film to everybody.

Watching a good movie is one of my favorite pastimes. After a long day of work there is on other sensations such as curling up on the couch and watching a great movie. Epic stories throughout our history our best portrayed through excellent."
9,Great acting filming and storytelling,"A band of mostly Italian American sociopaths terrorize each other and local businesses aided by corrupt law enforcement, courts, and crooked elected officials. Still one of the best movies ever made if not the best."
10,Great film,"Probably one of the best films ever and easily one of the great films of the 70s. An all-star cast including Pacino, Brando, and Diane Keaton. Won best picture along with it's sequel. Also the best James Caan performance ever.

The film begins with the wedding of Godfather, Vito Corleone's daughter. Michael, played by Pacino, is home from the army to attend. James Caan plays Michael's hothead brother, Sonny. Sonny is involved in the family ""business"" which Mike wants no part of...at first. Double-crosses and surprising changes of heart make this a film every adult would enjoy."
9,Amazing film & Cast,"The most fascinating of the three. The more ""pushed"" portrait, in some ways even speckled, of the Sicilian mafia transplanted to ""New York"", of its splendor and its misery, of its charm, made of cynical and timeless jokes, of oozing charisma, of smiles that burn of deception."
10,Marlon Brando,"Even though my dad named me over the actor of Godfather and even though he thought I will turn out to be a gangster I never wanted to watch this movie since it was a bit old. However, I never released what amazing this movie would be till recently. A real-time gagster, MOB movie that I highly recommend.

I never realized that this movie would be good until recently and I got to say that this is one of the greatest movies of all time that I watched.

Even though the movie is long, trust me every minute of this movie is amazing.

There are some amazing actors in this movie, and surely my favorite is Marlon Brando.

'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. ...

What a movie!! Highly recommended!!"
9,Why have I waited so long to watch it!?,"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Omg, why did I wait so long to watch this classic?! ""What's the matter with you?"" 😎😃 #Godfather."
10,Amazing,I have seen this movie dozens of times and want to see it dozens more.
2,This movie is an over complicated piece of dogcrap.,"You know what they say about this film. You either love it or you hate it. There's no in between.

Now I'm on the hate it side. I know I know, ""B-But... this film is a work of art wah wah"" Seriously, I've seen works of art. Like Bladerunner or Planet of the Apes, or Inside Man or EVERY CRISTOPHER NOLAN FILM, or Star Wars or Office Space.

This film is overcomplicated. It just takes the average spaghetti crime film and makes it the longest most boring thing ever. If you have the time to watch this movie, watch something ELSE. This movie is overrated, CRIMINALLY. And I will not stand and watch and let people love it. Why is it the best movie of all time? That's --- That's just wrong. It's 25th hour people, GROW UP.

2 stars. Sorry if I offended people I am just livid."
10,Masterpiece,"Tempting to give this less than ten so there's room to take it up a notch for part 2, but would be spuriously ungenerous. Almost cliched with the horses head, ""offer he can't refuse"" and ""sleeps with the fishes"". Even now, nearly 50 years on, the period detail for the time it is set seems oddly even more valid"
10,"""The Godfather"" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made",Wonderful movie and one of the greatest films ever made
10,What happened To the original version of this film,"I would like to know what happened to this film and why was it edited and not available in it,s original version any more.I know Coppola edited it for television around 1976 and the standard version that is available now is a very wimpy version of the film I saw in 1972 and a few more times in the mid seventies.First of all the sex scene between Sonny and Lucy actually showed some nudity,where in the current version it just shows the end part.All of the foul language is all edited or overdubbed,and the scene where Sonny is assassinated is missing some frames and is less violent than it,s original form.I am a big fan of James Can and the scene where he gets the news of his fathers shooting has been removed along with where he tells his mom about it.After he gets the phone call from Connie because Carlo beat her again it cuts the part out where Sonny comes storming out of the house using the four letter word three or four times.This is also missing.The Godfather (uncut) is the best film ever made and was James Caans most searing performance.I would like to know if I can find it anywhere as I have been searching for over twenty years now and am deeply saddened that such a fine movie was ruined.Help please."
9,The beginning of the mafia,"awesome movie. In mafia movies , but this film will only weapons and combat all processed very good script and acting. Processing of the rise and fall of a family . perfect crime and drama along with other films. A great movie that everyone should watch before you die. great processed as subject Marlon Brando was much better movie with great acting One of the few films awarded in three branches. The poverty of a man is the subject of short films and desire to stand against the influence of poverty and injustice is important to understand the ability to kill people and is proving its strength. It is a film that addresses the creation of a mob and growth"
2,why?,Why people see it as one of the greatest movies can be for different tastes
10,This is a cinematic masterpiece,"The Godfather (1972) is a masterpiece that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Paramount+. The storyline follows an American mafia family with a Godfather who is a direct descendant from Italy. As the father gets older and close to dying and handing down his power within the family he fields a series of asks, favors and political placement requests for power within the underground world.

This movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now) and stars Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire), Al Pacino (Scarface), James Caan (Misery), Diane Keaton (Annie Hall), Robert Duvall (Slingblade), Talia Shire (Rocky) and Abe Vigoda (Joe versus the Volcano).

The performances by the entire cast in this movie is outstanding with especially powerful performances by Brando and Pacino and strong supporting performances by Duvall, Caan and Shire. The soundtrack and settings are legendary. This film makes you want to book a trip to Italy immediately. The mafia wedding to start the movie is so well executed and as is the evolution of Pacino's character. The dialogue is brilliantly written and the cast delivers every line with the right level of intensity. The ending a perfect way to end the movie and show the power and struggle of being The Godfather.

Overall this is a cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see. I would score this an easy 10/10."
9,On of the best movie ever made!!!!,This movie made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
10,A Film Classic,No much needed to be said about this film except it is a definite must watch.
10,The best movie ever,"The Godfather is the best movie I ever saw. No movie in my entire life has made me actually live the life of the gangsters when I was watching it . I wanna thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola and most of all the Corleone Family for giving me the opportunity to see this amazing work of art . I recommend this movie to all people..... and I hope it stays in top a million years from now. Once you saw it you will want to see it again , and again , and again because no other movie gives you that feeling of ""I'm on top of the world"" . The actors.... what can I say... you already know that one of the best actors in the world are playing , with the master Marlon Brando ahead of all. All actors who play'd in this movie had a fulminating career in the next years.

Watch this movie , and vote it 10 because it really is the best... if not for me do it for the memory of Marlon Brando."
10,the best movie,"This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions."
10,For a filmmaker this film is like bibliography,"This film's screenwriting is truly a bibliography for a filmmaker and an amazing story. It is such a masterpiece that everyone should watch this film. This is a beautifully crafted film about a gangster. Amazing actors, directors, and producers! THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of filmmaking, an epic in the truest sense of the word, and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. The film has an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than flamboyant. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.... It was carefully crafted."
10,Movie worth watching !!!,Crime genre movie with excellent cast and outstanding direction which makes me watch the movie again and again...won 3 academy award...based on the novel of Mario Puzo.. though the movie revolves around mafia family but not for those who are looking for a family drama..
4,i like mafia movie but also,"I like the mafia in this movie, very creative and the action is cool even if it is sparce. Where this movie faulters is its cinemifotgraphy and writing i think its badly written espically the comedic parts, obviously it was a rushed film and compared to other movie its bad. Espically compared to ferris buelrs big day off a cinematic masterpiece and great film, the writing ci emafotography and other componenets were great espically when considering its low budget overall ferris bulers big day off is one of the best movies of all time and id reccomend to anyone espically over this ""godfather"" movie."
10,Review for The Godfather,"An acclaimed film that deserves its acclaim, The Godfather validates the crime epic and explores the dark side of the American dream. The Godfather is simply a classy production; unlike the mass of movies, most of which can each be criticized on some level, The Godfather manages to engage its audience throughout, and the portrayals of Brando, Pacino and Duvall, to name a few, were instant classics. Moreover, the film is memorable, in particular for its performances, assured direction and insightful depiction of the corridors of power of the American Mafia (not to mention it's extremely quotable). I did not give it ten out of ten for this reason: it did not move me so much as some other films. The Godfather is not my favorite movie, but I can see how for many people it is."
10,Best movie ever!,"The Godfather show us that a good movie remains forever a good movie. We should see all the little parts and all the sub-meanings that this movie brings. The cast is exceptional and Marlon Brando (may God have mercy of his soul) plays in a way that words can't describe it. Just watch the movie and enjoy it. It's the best movie ever! The Godfather II and III were only good, not exceptional like the first part. This is a once in a lifetime movie and it must be understood. I've read all sorts of articles and declarations of the actors, i know all the story of making the movie and that information, beside watching the movie convinced me that The Godfather will remain one of the best movies of the history. It should get more Oscars."
9,Best Gangster Movie,"One of the best Gangster movies ever made. This is the movie that has inspired several film makers across the world. Though many gangster movies have been produced, nothing comes closer to the GODFATHER."
10,"A 10, one of the greatest of all time","Crime dramas are not my favorite, but any movie that starts with a great script, great cast and the exceptional talent of Francis Ford Coppola means a great movie is not dependent on the subject matter but the execution. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were at their best and it's hard seeing actors performances stand up to their talent; and Robert DeNiro as the young Vito matches Brando so well. All three cemented their places in film history with The Godfather. If there is a drawback it's that both parts I & II are all one movie and at 6 hours would have made a great mini series. While part III doesn't have quite the punch, it is a necessary addition to this mini series. There are very few films that earn a 10 in my book, but The Godfather Parts I & II are in the elite club."
9,SUPER,"One of the greatest movies of all times! I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience. Its tremendous work done. This movie depicts the sincere work with lots of love. No one can bring out such an epic movie, even if paid a billion dollars each. I just get up everytime I hear Godfatherto watch time and again."
10,amazing,"Loved it.



the best movie ever made in the world"
5,great movie,The godfather is a great movie to watch with the fellas. Its a must watch movie if your into mob movies. Something to watch on a Saturday night. 3 hours long but worth every minute of it.
8,one of the best in modern cinema,"one of the best movies in modern cinemas cant be better,all the actors are amazing and the story line will attach you till the end of the three parts . it seems that all the crews were working with harmony and they did their best to deliver the idea of the director as he imagined it . i think many directors those days tried to make similar stories but nobody succeed till now. I thought this was a normal movie, but when i watched it more than three times i realized that this is one of the best movies more than that really. I personally would call it the greatest movie ever made. It was good, worth watching once,twice and tenth and I'm glad I've finally seen it.i wish our new generation can give to the cinema movies like this or at least very close but unfortunately nowadays its very hard to find team that will bring such a movie"
9,The Transformation,"The movie starts with a wedding ceremony where the father of the bride is the boss of an organized crime syndicate. His elder son takes the whole control of his place when he was attacked to near death. The situation forced the younger son to take the whole control while he was not interested in his family business. Thus, the movie deals with how the youngest son transforms from a good guy to a ruthless mafia kingpin.

Umm, I don't have to tell more about this movie, as thousands of people in the world who are great in movie reviewing, are already reviewed it. So, nothing new to tell more.

The thing is, this movie is considered an all-time masterpiece in history. I would like to focus which I liked in this movie.

Marlon Brando, is the aging father, The Godfather in this movie. Whose performance is one of the things which made this movie great.

Al Pacino, is the youngest son, also did great performance which nominates him the Best Supporting Actor Academic Award. But he refused to attend it as he thought he deserved a nomination for Best Actor category. Since this movie centered him. And also he had the most screen time. Whereas, Marlon Brando got the Best Actor award for his almost brief role. I think, it is justified, as the first impression is the last impression. Marlon Brando is the first impression of this movie. He is the life of this movie and Al Pacino is one of the parts of the body. But in fact, Al Pacino is the hero of this movie.

I liked the music, which was also nominated for the Best Score award but cancelled its nomination at the last moment when it was discovered that the score was originally used in another movie first, which is Charlie Chaplin's Limelight.

The director of this movie is Francis Ford Coppola. I wonder, how he directs the movie? He was just 32-33 year old when the movie was made. A 31-32 year old young man directs this masterpiece movie. And finished it in 62 days of shooting. This is amazing. Being a 33 year one now, I really wonder how he directs the movie in this small age? Such a matured movie. Though, it was first offered to director, one of my favorite directors, the director of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, Sergio Leone. Later he regrets his decision.

This movie is the finest example of an ideal writing and editing. Without these, this movie is nothing, despite having good casts and direction.

I enjoyed the movie a lot. I believe almost everyone will enjoy it. Despite a long movie, long 3 hours.

Don't watch it with the family.

Recommended 95%."
8,Best,"A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are."
10,Best in class!,"One of the best movies ever made! Best actors; great scenes, direction, location, production! We need more directors, actors, & producers like this to return to the US, operating on all cylinders! The story, although disturbing & bloody and vaguely based on true stories related to the mafia/cartel is so true to life."
5,the Godfather,"The movie's story is carefully crafted and engaging, with a perfect balance of suspense, action, and drama. The tension builds up gradually as the plot unfolds, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the end. The characters are well-defined, and their relationships with each other are complex and captivating. The dialogues are iconic and memorable, making the movie stand out as a true work of art.

The movie's cinematography is stunning, with beautiful shots of New York City and its surroundings. The background score adds an emotional dimension to the story, enhancing the impact of each scene."
9,great movie,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema. This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions. Thanks for making this movie."
10,The best movie ever made!,"Once you see part 1 you will have to see part 2 and 3 following it. There is just no way around it...This fist time I saw Godfather part 1 I couldn't appreciate it seeing as i was only 10 years old. But now i am 21 and that has changed. I major theme throughout the movie is of course ""family"". This movie can be called the best because it is without a doubt flawless. I challenge you to find anything you didn't like about the film. Mario Puzo is a genius and Marlon Brando acting was excellent. His career was already excellent but i think that after making a film like The Godfather, he will forever be known as Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"". There will never be a film more powerful and remarkable then this."
10,The Godfather I,"True, the film was about the Mafia, and in the minds of the Mafias are usually depicted as violent, ruthless, anti-people and cruel, but in this film it can even be said that the Corleone Mafia, and Vito Corleone, the Good Mafia is shown! A godfather who cares about those around him, sometimes does justice to them, his family does not care about him, and he does not use his influence to trade drugs and pays for it! Of course, apart from the differences between Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone, the film finally comes to the point that when the mafia, and business and work take precedence over the family, you will kill people in the general way and have to commit crimes. Who knows, maybe the world of politics is the same, with the difference that there is no escape from it ..."
10,godfather,"Fantastic!!!! All the three one are great!!! This one has Marlon Brando, Pacino, Durvall, Diane Keaton!!! Need more?!!? well, a great history, great pictures, and a great director!!!!

10,Sorry Shawshank,Still the best. All gangster films and tv shows wish they had the class Godfather does
10,A magnificent film seen and revisited multiple times,"Le Parrain is simply one of my all-time favorite films. I was completely captivated by this epic saga from the very first time I watched it. Every time I revisit it, I am immersed in the dark and fascinating world of the Italian-American mafia.

What struck me the most were the incredible performances by the actors. Marlon Brando is absolutely extraordinary in the role of Don Vito Corleone. His presence on screen is magnetic, and his acting is captivatingly intense. I also admire Al Pacino in the role of Michael Corleone, delivering a stunning performance as he portrays the gradual transformation of his character.

The plot is meticulously crafted, with surprising twists and palpable tension throughout the film. Each scene is carefully executed, with meticulous attention to detail and striking visual aesthetics. The iconic music by Nino Rota adds an extra layer to the film's atmosphere, enhancing the emotional impact of various sequences.

What makes Le Parrain so special is its ability to delve into the complexities of family and power, exploring the moral dilemmas that the characters face. The film raises profound questions about human nature and the choices we make. It also offers an authentic portrayal of immigration and cultural identity."
10,To the mattresses,"The Godfather is such an amazing movie that holds you onto the screen without breaking a lick of your attention, it is just that great of a masterpiece. You can feel the fear of every uncertainty lurking in the next corner along the movie all the time . It is periodic piece never will be seen again not in this lifetime, not . It is something I experienced like once in a lifetime event of watching this movie that came down on me like a miraculous event of diamond shower . Yep Jewels . It showered jewels of emotions all along the movie with a story so captivating that it will give you a feel as if you walk along them and oh the expressions of everyone as they go through the movie behind the cameras we feel them . It was one of the most perfect movies I experienced without a hint of complaint . I just watched it for the first time and this is how I felt and these words were too much to hold onto myself . It felt like I had to express this. I am not going discuss any plot here . Just if you find the depth of the movie from my words alone then you're going to the mattresses with this movie ."
10,"A film about family, not gangsters","It's 2022, is it even worth writing a review of a film 50 years old that's already acknowledged as one of, if not the greatest film ever made?

I'm here because although I've had the vhs, then the dvd and now the restored blu-ray I've just been lucky enough to watch this masterpiece at the cinema, it's currently being shown to mark the 50TH anniversary.

I'm 50 myself so I've grown up with the film, so it's slow pace seems normal to me. Whether younger generations will adjust to it who knows. The wedding at the beginning is probably too long but perseverance for the first 25 minutes pays off later.

The Godfather has many iconic scenes, so much so that a lot of them are known to people even if they've never seen this film and they've been parodied heavily over the decades.

Although this was originally made as a stand alone film the beauty of the trilogy is that they tie the films together so well, although the third film arrived many years later so feels weaker than the first two it's still essential. Part ll jumps back and forth between events set before and after The Godfather which makes the whole story enriched and for the better.

Set yourself a weekend aside, turn your phone off. Make yourself some pasta, pour yourself a glass of wine and sit back and enjoy."
5,nice,"Nice one, finest character!...............................cool!"
10,The Coppola Restoration,"The name ""The Coppola Restoration"" says it all - because the complete ""Godfather"" trilogy for this Blu-ray edition has been extensively restored at the insistence of director Francis Ford Coppola. Since the original camera negative no longer existed, the best possible pieces were brought together from all parts of the world, subjected to film scanning on a 4k scanner and then polished on thousands of individual images using the latest digital technology: Contrast and colors were optimized and coordinated with one another , Dirt particles removed and much more.

All this and what Steven Spielberg has to do with the whole thing can be found in the article ""Rescue through film emulsion"", which is unfortunately a bit short at 19 minutes. ""When the shooting was over"" also focuses on technical processes such as editing and music. Indispensable for cineastes is ""A masterpiece that was almost none"", which addresses the difficult production conditions and the problematic situation of the filmmakers at the end of the sixties (with detailed input from George Lucas, among others). The pop-cultural meaning of ""The Godfather"" is made abundantly clear to the viewer in ""The Godfather's World"" (keyword ""The Simpsons""). In addition, there are many other new bonuses and - kudos to Paramount - all the extras of the DVD edition from 2001 (including three frank director's comments, a 75-minute documentary, deleted scenes). Our conclusion: the Blu-ray box is an offer that cannot be refused."
10,Must watch,"It's the 1st out of 3 movies. If you ask me, you must watch all of them. As a gangster moive, and appart from this genre, it is one of the best movies I have ever watched."
10,You straightened my brother out?,"What an absolutely marvelous movie! Ford Coppola is truly an amazing director, and so are the entire cast of The Godfather. If it weren't for the second film of this franchise, and also Goodfellas, I would've undoubtedly dubbed this as the best crime drama of all time.

The movie starts out showing the full and yet uncorrupted Corleone family, with Don Vito Corleone as the head of the family, Sonny as the hot headed underboss, Tom Hagen as the Consigliere, Fredo as the weak brother who is something between a soldier and a capo and Michael, the youngest of them all who doesn't want to walk along the path of his father. Soon enough though, internal trust issues arise in the family as multiple assasination attempts are carried out on a few family members, of which, Michael takes revenge for.

In an attempt to hide Michael from the ensuing drama, he is sent back to Sicily, where he finds new life and tries to start from there. But his short yet dark history follows him and he is left with nothing after going through all the things he has gone through. The innocent, brave war hero Michael is now willing to take on his father's shoes and bring the Corleone family its lost muscle and respect.

In this movie, we see many things that current movie crews can learn from. From using lighting to cover heavy make-up, to an absolute masterful execution of a Juxtaposition right around the end, this movie has it all. All 3 hours of it is a beautiful learning and enjoyable experience.

Also just saying, if you're watching this with kids, there's just a few seconds of upper-body nudity here from Simonetta Stefanelli and that's about it. So if your kid is above 14-15 it should be fine."
9,Who's the real godfather in this film?,"Well what is there to say about this movie? Is it still the top movie on this site, or is it not? Personally, it is not one of the reviewer's all time favorites, but it is still a very good movie. One significant detail of this movie, is counter culture. The movie is filled with it.

As the movie starts Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is known as the Godfather, is in his office. It is his daughters wedding day, and according to Sicilian tradition, he cannot refuse any requests that are made to him that day. The room is filled with people wanting something. The whole family is there for the occasion. Michael (Al Pacino), the God father's youngest son , is back home from the war. He brings his new girl friend, (Diane Keaton) with him. Michael's brothers, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there too.

Family loyalty is an important message that is stressed in this movie. The Don, Vito Corleone heads the family . He is against dealing in drugs. According to him, society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling or prostitution, but he feels it is wrong to deal drugs. He refers to it as a dirty business. What appears to be a moral decision on the Don's part is really counter culture because his decision not to support dealing in drugs has nothing to do with the legality of it but because he feels society would not accept it.

A lot of emphasis is put on trusting a man's word, yet the central character do not always trust each other. Woman are not highly regarded by the family. The Don's wife is only shown in a few scenes. Sonny ignores his wife. and the Don's daughter Connie's husband is not allowed into the family business. Instead, he given a job so he can earn a living. The counter culture in this movie, represents the killings of innocent, and not so innocent people between families. Throughout most of the movie, the Corleone family is in somewhat of a battle between another Italian family. Because of this, Don Corleone who is the Godfather of many, (Marlon Brando) is shot by one of the other families. This heats up the subject for the Corleone family, because it puts two of his sons Michael (Al Pacino) and Santino `Sonny' (James Caan) in between a rock and a hard place. That is just one of the examples of counter culture in this movie. Here is another example. Sunny finds out two different times that his sister's husband is beating her. Outraged by all this happening, Sunny takes off to go find his brother in law. The first time, he finds him, he is successful in beating the wind out of him, however the second time he gets gunned down by his in-laws. Right about then, Don, is called to make a peace treaty with the other family, to stop all this violence between the families. But are all the violent scenes in the movie over with? Unfortunately not. There are so many more examples of counter culture than the ones listed in this review. In order to see all the examples of counter culture, you would have to view the movie a couple times to understand what is going on in it.

Over all, it was a very good movie in my opinion. I was Glued to the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting to see what happens next. The reviewer gives The Godfather a five gold star rating."
10,best movie,Best mafia movie ever old but gold 10/10 100/100 5/5 5 star age raiting: 13+
4,review,Cool very very good movie this is probably my favourite movie amazing cool fantastinc tanzalizinly cool funny drama action comedy
10,A movie that has remained in everyone's mind,"The Godfather is one of the best of its kind and in my opinion it is considered one of the masterpieces in the history of world cinema.

I first heard the name of this film from one of my colleagues, and I thought that she exaggerated the definition of this film, but when I saw the film, I realized that it is a unique work.

Of course, we heard that this movie has a second part, and like the first part, this movie has many fans, and there have been many discussions among critics about which movie is better.

I recommend all the people who have not seen this movie to watch this movie because I think that good movies always have something to teach people."
10,What a MASTERPIECE!!!!!,Oh my god this movie is a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola!! I'm gonna see this movie a few more times!! Go check it out someday it is so good!
8,Great movie,Loved the plot and the actors in this movie. They put a good cast together for this film as well.
10,Top movie,"The best movie of all time, because it shows what true character development is in a movie. The character arch of Michael Corleone through the movies is one of the best ever written. It succeeds not only in pulling off the use of a classical/formal/mannered film language correctly and remarkably; that language is used to emotionally evoke a grand archetypal American narrative, Operatic and Tragic, built around an immigrant family, and charting its rise, corruption, and fall in ways that comment on a vast array of subjects that relate to the American condition: Marriage, Politics, Poverty, Crime, Innocence Lost, Violence, Loyalty, Betrayal, etc. etc. So: It's a classical tale told nearly perfectly; with rich, soulful acting, magnificent cinematography, and insinuating, meaningful dialogue."
10,Great movie,Great movie...i love it . The film is about real life in past in america. It was a very strange society.
10,Iconic Movie,"The accents are amazing in this movie, one of the best movies I have seen.

The suspense is built properly and the cast was brilliant."
9,Exceptional,The movie was very good and i enjoyed watching it.
10,best movie,"Best movie which has good number of actors dedicated to their role.""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, stands as a monumental masterpiece in the landscape of American cinema. This epic crime film, released in 1972, weaves the tale of the powerful Corleone mafia family, with a focus on the transformation of Michael Corleone, played with unparalleled depth by Al Pacino, from reluctant outsider to ruthless mafia boss.""The Godfather"" is not just a film about the mafia; it is a story about America, about the immigrant experience, and about the dark underbelly of the American Dream. It challenges the viewer to contemplate the price of loyalty, the bonds of family, and the cyclical nature of power and violence."
10,My Favorite Movie of all Time!,"Brando, Paccino, James Caan, Robert Duvall. What an ensemble of talent. And of course Francis Ford Coppola."
8,The godfather,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film."
9,great movie,"The rhythm is gentle and the music is light and sad, but it contains great energy. Whether it is performance or the use of lenses and music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment"
10,Legendary!,"On of the most legendary films in the entire film history. I was a kid when I first wathced this masterpiece (probably, not the best movie for kids). However, it became one of those films which shaped my taste in films. BRAVO!"
9,9 out of 10,"Its just one of those classics that you can watch time and again, remembering this was shot in the late 60s early 70s, some or a lot still struggle to create this kind of quality today with millions more of budget, this is definitely the 'Godfather' of the Mafia films, and has paved the way for a lot of those great quotes like ' Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.'"
10,"""I Believe in America""","The Godfather is a masterpiece. It is one of the few films without any significant weaknesses (any that I've found, at least) and it's been my favorite film since I first saw it at age 15. Each and every actor gives a stellar performance, especially Marlon Brando as Don Corleone and Al Pacino as his son Michael. Both men completely disappear into their roles, transforming Mario Puzo's characters into pop culture icons. The pacing of the movie is brilliantly done, keeping the audience wanting more through the whole three-hour runtime. The score by Nino Rota is amazing and has stuck with me long after my last viewing (I will occasionally find myself humming the Love Theme without meaning to), and the writing is brilliant. I could go on and on about everything that makes this movie a classic, but it really has all been said before. All I have left to say is that you need to see this movie if you haven't already. The Godfather more than lives up to the hype.

10/10"
10,An Unexpected Great Movie,"I went into this movie with the mindset of this will be overrated. After watching, Goodfellas, The Departed, and The Irishman, I expected The Godfather would be the same. All I expected from it was to be the first best mob movie, which set the trend of all other mob movies. As I started watching it, I quickly realized it isn't like the other mob movies. It is better. It has more of a story and character development. The Godfather is one of the best mob movies ever, with an actual story and character development. The acting is impressive, and the story is even better. This is 100% a must-watch if you are into mob movies or classic movies."
10,So inspiring,"This film will works so well it takes the place in underworld

The Godfather is a 1972 American epic gangster film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The film stars an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss."
10,Simply a masterpiece.,"The Godfather is written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall and Richard Conte.

The ageing patriarch of an organised crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.

Whenever you get into a discussion with someone about filmmaking or ask about their favourite movies of all time, at some point they will mention The Godfather. There's a very simple explanation for this, and it's something to be discovered when experiencing the movie for yourself.

It's very clear how incredibly well written this movie is, from the first scene, to the last. Not only the writing, but the magnetic performances throughout are consistently showcased against a backdrop of New York from 1945-1955. One of the reasons this movie is so beautiful is because of how realistic it is. Although we can't say we've been a part of an empire like featured in the movie, we can all relate to the characters. It's a dark and tragic story.

The acting as aforementioned is phenomenal. Brando is vitally important in his convincing portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. As is Al Pacino as he gradually becomes the front-man during the movie's running-length. Caan has a heart-breaking turn in his character's arc, and he performs wonderfully. The same for Duvall, Conte and everyone else not mentioned. The list is too long to name each individual, but they don't go unnoticed.

Although this is a long movie, there's so much going on and in such intricate detail that the time effortlessly drifts by. Every character has a chance to transform within the time-frame. Don't be put off by the duration. Many filmmakers these days are afraid of making their work too long, but if done correctly, it can be a tremendous piece of art. This movie is a fine example of that fact.

The original score by Nino Rota is one of the most recognised soundtracks of all time, and respectfully so. There are moments where his music is used greatly, and moments where it isn't used at all. While this happens the music is changing also. It's the perfect sound for such a story, and pairs with the picture brilliantly.

Verdict; The Godfather is widely regarded as a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of our time. I can fully agree with these statements and add that in its many years since release, it hasn't aged a bit. If you haven't yet experienced The Godfather, please do yourself a favour. With so much greatness in front of you, it's an offer you can't refuse.

The Godfather, 10/10."
10,Greatest movie ever made,"If anything is close to being perfect, this is it..."
10,Should be #1 all time guys. prove me wrong.,"Best movie of all time. This is not a movie, its a mf play, adapted to screen. Bravo to the team! Beautiful."

5,best movie ever,Great movie for people growing up in the hood. I love it.
9,Good,"So of a Good Movie.

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
10,Best Ever Selected Profile,"The inspiration from the movie a sort line and sort story.

The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. ... Michael, the young and idealistic son of Vito Corleone, the head of the most powerful Mafia clan in New York, returns home as a war hero and is determined to live his own life."
9,What a great movie,"I like the plot of the story of this film, it's good. See my profile, to be able to date you. I'll wait.

I like the plot of the story of this film, it's good. See my profile, to be able to date you. I'll wait."
8,good,"The Godfather is a technically educational film with a dark and realistic atmosphere. The cinematographer of the film, Gordon Willis, used shadows and contrast in such a way that when you watch, you say this is the movie. On the one hand, you are watching the dark and beautiful atmosphere, and on the other hand, you are watching the plot. Some people may have been bored in the first scenes while watching the movie, but I wasn't bored because the mafia theme was a theme I liked before. The film tells about the dispute between the Carlone family and Comma Solozzo over his drugged job. Don Carleone politely refuses the offer, calling it a ""druggy"" dirty job, but Solozzo, who is not very pleased with this, personally arranges an assassination of Carleone, causing things to escalate. This is the crucial point of the film. We are watching the characteristic change of Michael, who normally has little to do with family affairs. Michel first kills Solozzo to avenge his father, and then takes over the family business. It's as if that innocent child who was watching family affairs from a distance is gone, instead of a calm but cold killer has arrived. Michael is actually the opposite of his brother Sonny. Sonny is a person who can't control his anger, acts irrationally, while Michael is logical and so calm. No matter how much ""The Godfather"" is a crime movie, it's actually a movie that moves from a father and son relationship. The best example that can be given to this is the scene where Don Vito and Michael are alone. In this scene, Carleone says that he has always worked for his family all his life, and he will not be ashamed to work, but he has not thought about Michael to take over the family until today. It was a pretty good movie for me, but it may not appeal to everyone, I can understand that. The main point that you should focus on in this film is not the mafia life, but that you can't trust anyone but your family and that you have no one but them. Otherwise, why would Kim turn his family into a criminal organization? We also see in the film that almost everyone betrayed the father except his sons.(Comma Solozzo, Tattaglia family, Carlo, Tessio) That's what I meant when I said you can't trust anyone but your family. Finally, I have a cutting message for those who don't like the Godfather and have hated him all their lives: Watch the Godfather not as a mafia movie, but as a father and son movie, because only then can you love this movie. Enjoy the mafia theme if you want, hate it if you want Junkie theme. Thanks for Reading."
8,amazing,"Amazing movie, i did not expect the ending to turn out like that. One of the mafia movie classics"
10,ADVENTURE,"The Godfather is a landmark film that redefined the gangster genre and elevated it to an art form. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel, the movie takes viewers into the complex world of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia dynasty in 1940s New York. From the beginning, Coppola immerses the audience in a world of loyalty, betrayal, power, and family, making every frame feel as though it's charged with tension and emotion.

The movie's storyline centers around the transformation of Michael Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by Al Pacino. At the beginning of the film, Michael is an outsider to his family's criminal empire, a decorated war hero with no intentions of entering the ""family business."" However, as events unfold, Michael is gradually drawn into the world of organized crime, ultimately becoming his father's successor. This transformation is a journey of inner conflict, one that pulls him away from his morals, family, and the hope of a different life. Pacino's nuanced performance is essential to the film's power, portraying Michael's descent into ruthlessness while maintaining a sense of humanity.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family, is equally unforgettable. With his distinctive voice and measured movements, Brando gives the character an aura of authority and respectability, humanizing a role that could easily have felt one-dimensional. The character of Vito Corleone is a study in contrasts: he is ruthless when protecting his family's interests, yet shows warmth and wisdom in personal interactions. The audience can't help but be drawn to his sense of loyalty and his belief in the values that define the Corleone family.

Cinematography in The Godfather is masterful, establishing mood and atmosphere through the interplay of light and shadow. Cinematographer Gordon Willis, also known as the ""Prince of Darkness"" for his skillful use of low lighting, uses these shadows to add depth to scenes and reflect the moral ambiguity of the characters. From the intimate dimness of the Corleone family home to the stark contrasts of daylight scenes, Willis creates a world that feels both menacing and realistic.

The storytelling is paced deliberately, allowing viewers to become absorbed in the details of each character and their motivations. Unlike traditional crime dramas that focus on action and spectacle, The Godfather relies on dialogue, expressions, and moments of silence to convey tension and build suspense. The scene of Vito's son Sonny Corleone (James Caan) unleashing fury on a rival gang member, or Michael's first act of violence in the restaurant, are so intense and meticulously crafted that they stay with the viewer long after the credits roll.

Adding to the movie's impact is Nino Rota's haunting score, which brings an emotional depth to the film and becomes a character in itself. The Godfather theme is iconic, evoking both melancholy and foreboding, perfectly underscoring the tragedy that the story reveals. The music sets the tone for the film and subtly reflects Michael's internal journey and the inevitable fate of the Corleone family.

The Godfather isn't just a crime drama; it's a meditation on power, loyalty, and the American Dream. It explores how these values clash with morality, personal ambition, and family ties. Coppola's adaptation of Puzo's novel is meticulous, and each scene feels essential to the story, adding layers of depth to characters who are both flawed and admirable.

This movie remains timeless because it goes beyond the conventions of a gangster film, making it accessible to audiences of all backgrounds and eras. Its influence is evident in countless films and television shows that followed. If you're looking for an epic that combines masterful storytelling, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking themes, The Godfather is an essential watch. It's more than a film-it's an experience that continues to resonate, offering something new with every viewing."
10,A movie critic's dream.,"""The Godfather"" is one of the most praised movies in cinema history. It gives everything that critics and audiences alike ask for in movies. In my opinion it gets all the attention it gets for being one of, or the best movies ever. One of the best things ""The Godfather"" does is its incredible casting and its iconic performances from each and every one of its characters. The actors are so convincing that it won the movie several academy awards. It also jumpstarted several actors, acting careers, and gave an incredible ending to others. The Characters in the movie are outstandingly well handled. Each Character has somewhat of an arc within themselves, it shows each of their worldview and opinion of the situation that they face. It shows how their opinions, worldview, and personalities conflict with each other, and the consequences for reckless, illogical, and sudden decisions made by various characters. The film also gives the greatest character arc literally ever, through Michael Coralone, played by the incredible Al Pacino. The Godfather takes the viewer behind the closed doors of the Coralone crime family, a powerful Italian mafia group, and explores the pros and Cons of the organized crime lifestyle. Somehow through the immoral lifestyle that this movie bases itself upon, through things like narcotics, prostitution, alcohol, and violence it deals with very evident moral issues that we still face today, and does it in a somewhat redeemable way. The movie is also able to maintain a complex story with several moving parts, while also developing a very slow paced story. Therefore it spends time to dissect and flesh out its Characters and plot. It gives you a lot of time to interact and emotionally connect with its Characters, so that when they are lost it leaves a lasting impact on the viewer, and changes your view on the movie, and shows how it affects each of the characters involved differently. Another one of my favorite components of the Godfather is the cinematography and atmosphere. Its usage of crucial elements such as casting shadows and lighting communicates the dark essence that the film is going for, culture, and immorality, but always is able to communicate a sense of hope throughout. ""The Godfather"" has a very accurate portrayal of Italian culture and ways that culture is established within Immigrant America. I really enjoyed the cinematic representation visualization of organized crime and the abundance of style throughout. Speaking of style, another way the film communicates style and Italian culture is through the score. Just like the cinematography, the score communicates style and Italian culture, and accurately represents the way we visualize culture, crime, and atmosphere. ""The Godfather"" holds the best and most detailed character arc I have ever seen. You experience progressive stages of complete transformation through the changes of worldview and personality over the long period of time that this film takes place in.

""The Godfather"" though a very great movie, is very slow moving, so those who prefer their movies to be modern and fast paced fast paced may take a disliking to this movie. The Godfather has stood the test of time and leaves a lasting impact on cinema still today. It wows critics and audiences alike, and will for years to come. It truly is one of the greatest films ever produced."
10,"""Experiencing The Godfather in the Heart of Italy: A Personal Journey Through Iconic Scenes and Locations""","*The Godfather* is a cinematic masterpiece that blends extraordinary performances, brilliant direction, and memorable dialogue. During my trip through Italy, I read Mario Puzo's novel and visited the locations featured in the film, deepening my connection to its iconic scenes. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando deliver unforgettable performances, and Coppola's direction brings a tale of family, loyalty, and power to life. The film resonates deeply, especially when you experience it in the places where it all unfolds, making it even more powerful and personal. The raw emotion and complexity of the characters truly come to life in these settings."
10,Greatest of all time,"A true classic that never gets old. I regularly watch this (and both sequels) at least once a year, usually during either a snow day or a sick day."
10,Amazing,"Amazing, exelent movie, saw it when i was young, and still amazing!"
4,must watch,"Impressive and very nice.

There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now .In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox."
10,It's just great.,This movie is absolutely worth watching. I loved everything about it. Godfather and his son Michael made this movie so cool.
10,it's a masterpiece!,It definitely defined a new cinematic way to see into the characters and their growth. It also created a new ground for mob movies. The cast was also a key element to the movie Coppola did an amazing job directing. Brando's way of portraying Vito Corleone was spot on. Same with al Pacino.
10,THIS MOVIE GAVE ME THE PASSION,"When i watched this movie for the 1st time i knew i will become a cinematographer someday. I had to watch over and over to get some things inside cus it was really a movie not to miss i scene or bling your eyes.

The God father teaches alot about the society and its people and how you need to trust people and also be aware of who we trust."
10,A truly incredible masterpiece,"The Godfather is a movie that will never be forgotten. I watched it when I was 11, and I fell in love with it then.

This is a movie about an Italian mafia family living in New York. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the family, and he's always been taking care of everything. The movie first shows how the whole business works, with making sacrifices, keeping promises, and getting revenge. Sonny and Michael are Don Vito's sons. Everyone knew that Michael was the smart, elite ""college boy"" of the family, and Sonny was the completely opposite, and someday he'd be the head, the new Don Corleone. Michael doesn't want to be involved in the family business, until Don Vito gets shot by some of his enemies because of the whole deal about whether drugs should be sold or not, and troubles start to happen. Michael knows he's the only one who he can save his father. When he agreed to take revenge to the enemies who shot his father, he had gotten himself into a completely new life filled with violence, hatred, and betrayal, a world he had never experienced before, and there's no turning back.

I'm not gonna say what's going to happen next, for the people who haven't seen this yet. But if you're one of them, make sure you see this. This movie is absolutely perfect and flawless."
10,The Greatest American Myth,"Godfather sets a new golden standard in American cinema thanks to superb storytelling and bigger-than-life characters, creating a near mythological tale about family, power and corruption."
10,The temperament of outstanding men in the film,"Author Mario Puzo made The Godfather a classic, when he wrote about the mafia but didn't talk much about drugs, blood and gambling, but focused on describing the plots, events of the family, how each member of the family improvising with difficulties. The temperament of the ""small tycoons"" is thereby also clearly depicted. In the midst of the storm, there are cowards who run away, there are people who turn their backs on betrayal, there are brute force who use violence to suppress and then die in an instant. After all, the people who seem weak at first end up doing great karma, and the smartest person to plan everything, is none other than the Godfather!"
10,Winner of three Oscar,"The film was nominated by the Academy in eleven categories, and won three Oscars, for Best Film, Best Actor for Marlon Brando and Best Screenplay Adapted for Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. In addition, she was awarded five Golden Globes for Best Drama, Best Director, Screenplay, Soundtrack and Actor for Marlon Brando."
5,"A Classic, but for My ADHD Brain is a Slog","It's a classic, right? But as someone with ADHD, I have to say, watching it can feel like a bit of a slog. First off, this movie is nearly three hours long. That's a lot of sitting still! The pacing is super slow, and while I get that it builds tension and lets you really dive into the characters, there were moments when I found myself zoning out way too often. Those long conversations? They can feel endless. If you're someone who thrives on quick cuts and fast action, you might find your mind wandering. And then there are the characters. Don't get me wrong; they're fascinating! But there are so many of them, and keeping track of who's who can be a real challenge. With all the shifting loyalties and family drama, it's like trying to follow a soap opera without any background knowledge. I often felt lost in the details, which made it hard to stay engaged. The emotional depth is impressive-there's a lot to unpack about family loyalty and the consequences of choices. But honestly? Those slower emotional beats sometimes made me zone out. Instead of feeling connected to the story, I found myself getting restless during some of the quieter moments. I appreciate what they're going for; it's just that I need a little more action to keep my brain engaged. So yeah, while The Godfather is undeniably a masterpiece that deserves its status in film history, it can be a bit of a struggle for someone like me. If you love films that keep you on your toes and move at a quicker pace, this one might require some serious patience-or maybe just a good snack to help you power through!"

10,Best movie ever,"At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a story about power, family, and the price one pays for control. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of mesmerizing, earning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Brando brings a nuanced complexity to the character, presenting Vito as a man both feared and respected, with a deep sense of honor and loyalty.

The film's cinematography, led by Gordon Willis, is a visual feast. The use of dark and shadowy imagery adds an atmospheric depth to the narrative, reflecting the moral ambiguity of the characters. The iconic opening scene, set in Vito's office during his daughter's wedding, sets the tone for the entire film, capturing the duality of celebration and sinister undertones.

One cannot discuss ""The Godfather"" without acknowledging the brilliant ensemble cast. Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader as Michael Corleone is a cinematic journey that leaves an indelible mark. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, deliver performances that elevate the film to unparalleled heights.

Nino Rota's haunting score adds another layer of emotion to the film, with its memorable theme becoming synonymous with the legacy of ""The Godfather."" The music becomes a character in itself, underscoring the pivotal moments and resonating long after the credits roll."
10,Woah.,Definetly my top 5 movies. The brilliance from all of them is just different. The way the portrayed each character and how well the director did. I'm starting to think i might become an actor after watching this.
10,It's Marlon Brando for me,"This film hits all the marks without resulting to cheap gore and over the top performances. One really does feel as if they are a part of the Corleone family. Coppola managed to take a concept as dark and dangerous as the mob and humanize it, creating a full-circle story that makes the viewer feel pain, joy, familial bonds, anger, justice and injustice, throughout. Paired with his incredible storytelling are the performances of everyone in the cast; so strong and believable. (Marlon Brando being my favorite) This film should be a part of everyone's repertoire. What more could I say about a film that has been glorified since its creation?"
8,Brilliant,RGV is survived by making The Godfather series in Hindi. I loved this movie Rating 8/10
10,Elegant gentleman with a knife,"""I'm going to offer him a condition he can't refuse."" That's his negotiation skills. He is an elegant gentleman with a martini in one hand and a butcher knife in the other; a professional executioner in a noble suit talking about dirty business; he only needs a gesture to make others insured; and a smile is enough Into jade. They are awesome characters, but also good dancing assassins, whether politicians or funeral home owners, seem to be always waiting to listen to his gentle call, only because of his noble promise ""Someday-maybe this One day will never come, and I will let you do something for me. But before that day comes, please accept justice at my daughter's wedding, which is also a gift I give you! ""Well, yes What gave the godfather such a profound magic? Let him just sit there, a corner of that dark room, as if in the center of the black hole of the universe. People respect him, love him, and fear him. He is so complicated and so deep. Red blood and black in the dress are the most solemn tone in the film The Godfather. The Godfather tells us that as long as you can face this world decently, you can live decently. Therefore, he can casually interact with high-level political figures, from the lowest level to the highest level of society, he can also weave a large and intangible net. Therefore, whether it is a dispute over family interests or a trick of siblings, the godfather always seems to have the ability and spirit to control everything, isolated from all beings, overlooking the sky."
5,Didn't do it for me,Now I understand that this film was groundbreaking... but it didn't do it for me. Marlon Brando was impossible to understand and the plot was so hard to keep a track of. It definitely got better as it went on but did seem to drag for a bit with unnecessary scenes it felt like it should've been a series. I didn't hate it in the slightest and will be watching The Godfather 2 however I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a captivating or lighthearted film.
10,La mejor película de todos los tiempos,"Imprescindible para cualquier cinefilo, lo tiene todo"
10,Truly One of the Best Movies Ever Made,"About the only thing I remember when it comes to being introduced to this movie was with my oldest brother bringing in a box of movies that he didn't watch anymore. It turns out that one of them was this flawless work of art that we know as ""The Godfather."" Often imitated, never duplicated, you cannot go wrong with this. After watching it once, you just have to watch it again. The writing is crisp, the acting is excellent, and the music will hook you in without fail.

""The Godfather"" is pretty much a staple with my family, particularly with me and my middle brother. My mom loves it just the same and would recommend it to anyone. As my title states (and as anyone else may say as well), this is truly one of the best movies ever made. Period. You cannot put any other movie against it whatsoever. It won't work. Watch ""The Godfather"" once and then watch it again. It will give just about every other mafia movie a run for its money...and then some."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic treasure that transcends generations, standing as a true masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this 1972 classic has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.

At its heart, ""The Godfather"" is a tale of power, family, and the consequences of choices made in the ruthless world of organized crime. Marlon Brando delivers a career-defining performance as Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone crime family. His portrayal is nothing short of iconic, and it earned him a well-deserved Academy Award.

The film is a rich tapestry of complex characters, each brought to life by an exceptional cast. Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless heir is a masterclass in character development. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, is equally remarkable, adding depth and authenticity to this gripping saga.

Cinematographer Gordon Willis' work behind the camera is visually stunning, capturing the dark and moody atmosphere of 1940s New York with precision. Nino Rota's haunting score further enhances the film's emotional depth.

What truly sets ""The Godfather"" apart is its ability to evoke empathy for morally flawed characters. It explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the blurred lines between good and evil. The film's dialogue is sharp, its pacing flawless, and its storytelling, nothing short of Shakespearean in its complexity.

""The Godfather"" is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling in cinema. It has left an indelible mark on popular culture and continues to influence filmmakers to this day. If you haven't experienced this cinematic gem, do yourself a favor and watch it. It's not just a movie; it's a cinematic journey that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
10,Just masterpiece,"Never can this kind of movie be ever made... Francis Ford Coppola had given this masterpiece with excellent star cast who did amazing screen presence... particularly Marlon Brando & Al Pacino were fabulous in their role. Story, screenplay & background score to it's best."
10,A classic!!,"One of the greatest movies of all time!! Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business."
8,Impactful action scenes!!,"This movie stood the test of time for its unbelievable short impactful action scenes and the emotional drama between father and a son. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is just too good that you cant imagine anyone talking his place in the movie. The character's reaction on his son's loss and Al Pacino taking up the mantle was emotional and good.

Al Pacino got caught in the web of fate and ultimately becomes the dreaded gangster he and his father never intend to in the first place. The screenplay elements are way ahead of its time with many movies drawing inspiration from this colour classic!!!!"
9,Epic,A blueprint for tenacity in the making of the film. Love the story line. They say that Marlon Brando never memorizes his lines. He doesn't have a long drawn out monologue but wow he is the best. And Al Pacino killed it. I think the writer of The Godfather deserves so much credit for writing such an epic story but also a family story. Can we all relate to these characters? It some ways yes. We all have a Sal the screamer brutal one. The Michael that at first seems all pure and acts better than others in some ways becomes the head of the worst crime family. I also love Godfather 2 and Godfather 3.
10,Great,"Goog God, this movie is too great and I certainly dispise everyone who dislike the film by sayin...which shoul I say? Boring? Plot less?

Well God Damn them. The Godfather is one of the best pictures ever made, and the one with the best plot in cinema history. And the sequel is even better.

I read some comments saying that you can't fell anything for the characters. That isn't so at all. Vito Corleone is the best explanation of what evil is like. Not something supernatural, but something that comes out of human being (in fact, evil is one of the most human things there are). The Godfather tries to help people, and he does, only he kills and violate laws in the process. And what about Kay. Not much people talk about her because the movie is about men's power, but she was my favorite character, just the same, and it was a pity for me that Mario Puzo didn't tell her story in the film as he does in the book. She is lovely because of her love (a love, just as love is: strange) she is willing to pass through the good and the bad of the Corleone family.

Connie was bitchy, but not enough to be beaten by Carlo and it was horrible the way her father just ignore that. Good for Sonny, although he was killed. Fredo is a shame because he is good in so many things, and he complains about not doing what he'd hate to do. You have to watch the Godfather II, or read the book to understand.

After watching it several times, I understood how Michael became the monster that hits Kay. At the beggining he tells her something like he is not like his family, and at the end of the sequel he talks about murder like it's as normal as going to work.

Really the movie is good, but is hard, it takes time to tell its story, and you have to watch it several times to understand it completely (is the kind of movie where a simple name someone says once at the beginning can affect the entire movie) or read that wonderful book."
5,Ain't no Goodfellas,"Over the years, i have started watching this film multiple times and each time giving up as it had not captured me, however on new years eve 2024, off work and time to spare it popped up on my feed and I went for it.

I have seem many films over the years that I feel some people just go along with what others say about it, particularly if a film has attained some kind of legendary status, Star Wars, lord of the Rings to name a couple. The Godfather is one of those. I find it incredible that people are giving this 10. The film is slow, as I found the first few times I attempted to watch it, with minimal highlights. I am a lover of gangster movies and this is no where near Goodfellas, sopranos or even casino, which also got unwarranted accolades.

Whilst the acting is top class, as you would expect from the stars on show, the storyline and dialogue is weak, I feel and 3 hours of weak script does not make for enthralling viewing.

I wanted this film to grab me, but sadly, it just never happened.

I will never watch the follow ups, as this has been sick a let down, sadly too many people are like sheep and fall in to line, which I have no doubt been guilty of myself in the past, saying something was decent, when it was terrible, just to not upset a friend.

I would say to anyone, gove it a watch, assess yourself, as it may just be me that is so wrong, but one to chalk up as seen, but not as a must see, irrespective of the ratings."
9,So good,"Really impressed with the main male role of the film, he is the soul of the film. Although launched a long time ago, the value it brings remains the same. This movie is definitely an inspiration to many writers, directors and actors of the next generation. I often watch gentle movies, mafia-themed movies that make my emotions not good because too many 18+ scenes. However the reputation of the key set got me curious and I ended up looking at it. I have watched this movie many times and even bought books to read. I think the people around me should see it - An excellent work of world cinema. I give it a 9 because I don't like violent movies, that's all."
10,Best of best,Masterpiece for the human history. I believe even 1000 year after this will be the top 10 still
10,It's great,The Godfather is a beautifully created mafia film. The thing about this movie is that every character has a complicated personality.
10,The best movie I have ever seen,"I thought that The Godfather Part I was the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The amazing acting by Marlon Brando just blew me away. The story was so rich and probable. There was quite a bit of violence and adult themes, but these were essential to the realism and texture of the film. The thing that gave it it's brilliance was the acting, and the story. I most definitely agree with the place it is in on the IMDb top 250. Overall, i think this movie deserved a standing ovation. Marvelous. Outstanding. 10 out of 10. It was a superb film and I think that if you have not watched it, you must do so. This is a must see movie."
10,Way ahead of it's time,"I cannot anything that hasn't already been said about this movie. It is a perfect movie and something has just clicked about it that made it a masterpiece. The acting is like we are watching real life documentaties,the speed is thrilling,the plot engaging. The character,once you love them,stay part of you. Watching The Godfather is'nt just a good experience,it is joining the Corleone Family."
10,Godfather,"Review By Kamal K

Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.

Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.

The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.

Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. The Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances."
9,Icon and masterpiece.,"The Godfather is the second highest rated film on IMDb, and that says something about how widely appreciated it is. There is not much to say about it other than that it has exceptional performances throughout the entire cast and a very well supported script adapted from the novel. Its an incredibly immersive film, but it also takes some patience to watch all the way through. Part 1 and 2, which I think are both equally good and essentially one bigger story, take over 6 HOURS to watch. Its themes and setting are what is to be expected, and its also is true that The Godfather is an outstanding encapsulation of the era it takes place in too. When you have the time, you should go see for yourself how well it still holds up."
10,the best,"Again, the best. There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox."
8,Worth a watch!!,"Amazingly planned and put together, not a big fan of films personally but this is defo worth a watch!!"
10,Definition of Art,I did not know what art was until I was introduced to this love poem. Even better than the book. Godfather represents the history of America's immigration. In other words: a história da minha família.
10,Really good choice,"There is next to no that I can add to the audits on here, that have made sense of what is the big deal about The Godfather so well. I have seen many astonishing films, as well as some clunkers, however The Godfather was past astounding. There are such countless pictures, subtleties and scenes that I genuinely can't escape my head since watching it interestingly only nine hours prior. The Godfather is so extraordinarily very much made and acted that it stands apart among most of those other astounding movies I've seen, to such an extent I was unable to consider a solitary blemish, and I am battling to consider a sufficient motivation to why I didn't see this film before now. Really good choice, Amazing post thanks for sharing."
10,The best of the best,The best movie ever ! The actors are amazing and the movie is a masterpiece !
8,Masterpiece of all times,Godfather is the best movie of all time and it's perfect in everything. It's very well detailed. But for me it seems to be slow and there are less goosebumps.

10,It's 2020 and still the greatest movie of all time,I don't think we will get to see a movie as good and as Iconic as the godfather ever again
10,Role Model,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps."
10,Truly amazing movie to watch,"If you haven't watched this movie.. do watch it.

It has everything that a movie should have. Crime, drama, emotion, love and everything else that a good movie needs."
10,"Full of iconic scenes, The Godfather is considered one of the best films ever made, influencing many other productions, with a most familiar treatment of the mafia","In the late 1960s, Francis Ford Coppola was at the beginning of his career when he managed to take over the audacious production of Paramount Pictures' The Godfather. The Godfather tells the first part of the Corleone family saga. Commanded by the respected Don Vito Corleone, the mafia family controls illegal business in New York in the 1940s and 1950s, in constant conflict with other groups. The adaptation was written by the author of the book Mario Puzzo Puzo together with Coppola.

We started the projection in an almost absolute darkness. ""I believe in America"", we hear while Bonasera's face, in close up, appears on screen. There is no external sound, only this monologue of the man who asks the Godfather for a favor. Slowly the camera moves away, demonstrating the character's fragility, his ""small size"" inside that dimly lit room. Vito Corleone's back (Marlon Brando) begins to fill the picture and a simple hand movement already transmits an order, making it clear where the power is there. The first cut comes shortly after, and finally, we see Brando's face, full of perfect makeup, which turns a man of forty-eight years old into a man of almost sixty. Only through The Godfather can we truly see why Marlon is considered one of the greatest actors in history, which goes so far as to direct other actors on the scene. His portrayal of Vito is rich in details that guarantee our identification with the character. At the same time that he, the Godfather, is a fearsome man, who uses a subtle movement in order to compose his unshakable figure, he is a family man, devoted to his wife and children and who makes small and almost imperceptible interactions with everyone around you. He is a warm person who attracts anyone and does not need to openly demonstrate his power at any time. This, however, is not the story of Vito, but of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the real protagonist of the work, no matter how many believe the opposite. It is he who goes through the greatest dramatic arc that substantially alters his personality. Mike begins the plot as the least connected member of the family, a war hero who makes clear his shame about his father's business - his willingness towards his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) shows how much he wants to get away from that whole life of crime. As the plot progresses, however, Michael is led, step by step, towards what he most dislikes, being forced to defend his father, kill for him and, in short, succeed him. And how do we see the character change? Not only through the obvious, the script, but also through the nuances of Pacino's performance and the exceptional work of art direction and makeup of the production.

The film is, yes, about the Italian mafia, about the nuances that made up New York society in that historic period, but, before that, it is about family relationships and commitments. ""A man who does not dedicate himself to his family will never be a real man,"" says Don Corleone, even at the beginning of the story. This sentence summarizes what The Godfather is: the process of transforming a child into a father. After the attack that Don Vito suffers, we see Michael, the youngest, war hero, favored by his father, passed over by his brothers and the only one who was not involved in the ""business"" of the family, assuming his responsibility. More than avenging the father figure, Michael kicks off the journey that would make him the leader of the family. In a clear reference to the story of biblical patriarch Joseph, Michael faces the martyrdom of distance by hiding in Sicily - which gives us some of the most beautiful sequences in the film - as he matures and sees in the circumstances that happen in New York the need to sacrifice their will to preserve their family.

Michael's exile in Italy gives us an obvious shock. Gordon Willis' darkened photograph gives way to warm hues - the yellow of the earth and the green of the vegetation occupies each frame and harmoniously represent Michael's current mood. There he falls in love and there he says goodbye to much of his humanity. The cuts to New York, in this simultaneous narrative, bring us a notable discomfort: the war between the five families broke out and we remain in constant tension. Again Willis' photography comes to the fore, using classic framings, medium shots that do not deviate from the Hollywood standard, but that highlights every element of production design. Nothing is in a picture by chance - from the rose on Don Corleone's chest to the picture above the fireplace we have symbolic elements that reiterate the veiled violence of those conversations and the instability of the countless relationships portrayed.

In one of the best scenes in the film, just before Vito's death, Michael talks to his father in the garden of the house and discuss the plans that would develop at the climax of the film. At a specific point, the son looks to the right and the father to the left, illustrating, once and for all, the Corleones' past and future. The sadness in Brando's eyes is placed in contrast to Mike's veiled hatred. And why do I say hate? Palms again to Pacino who shows, in every tone, the shame he still feels about himself, how much he hates being part of that - ""in five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate"" - that is his goal, to escape from the family business, shape it, as if a part of itself begged for the salvation it left behind when it killed Sollozzo (Al Letieri) and Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). This, however, fails to distance the protagonist from his transformation into a kind of villain - something that photography itself makes evident, by making him come out of the shadows in the final moments, just as he did with the various antagonists throughout the projection - from Virgil Sollozzo to Don Barzini - bringing to the fore almost a nightmare logic. Michael is, therefore, a clear antithesis of himself, a lost man, but who nevertheless remains in control of absolutely everything - even sitting Pacino manages to demonstrate the power of his character. But the trajectory of the protagonist and the Corleones in itself is completed with the death of Carlo (Gianni Russo). In the opening minutes of the work we followed the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire) and in the end the same character becoming a widow. The melancholy of the narrative could not be created in a more obvious way and it establishes itself bringing with it a remarkable cohesion of the plot as a whole. We have the distinct feeling that a long period of time has passed since we heard ""I believe in America"" and, in fact, ten years have passed - again, without the need for didacticism.

Coppola's direction is consistent and responsive; conducts the tension of the story in such a beautiful way that it completely escapes the common shock proposed by this type of film. Because he admittedly dislikes violence and the plot is, at least at first glance, about gangsters, Coppola redirects the viewer's focus on moments of murder, distracting them with subtle elements - an orange that rolls during a shooting or a foot that leaves through the car window during a hanging, for example - which, in the end, make up the brilliant painting of that violent environment. Likewise, Gordon Willis' photography directly assists the filmmaker in his eagerness to make that fear structure beautiful. The light always coming from above highlights the features on the faces of the actors, further highlighting the threat and mystery behind each character, collaborating decisively in understanding the duality of those people. The contrast of light and dark highlights the paradox that exists between the mobster and the family man; the outlaw who blackmails and scares and the man who at home loves and sacrifices himself. The icing on the cake of this beautiful panic piece, without a doubt, is the unmistakable theme song created by Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola (in diegetic songs). Each melody perfectly reiterates what we see on screen, from Michael's romance in Italy, with intimate tones, to the most remarkable tensions built, such as the unforgettable sequence of the horse's head. The plot's progression, of course, is also well represented by the music, as the theme music heard in the opening seconds gains a tone that highlights the loneliness that is established with the advance of the projection.

Counting on iconic scenes, among the most venerated in cinema, it is in acting that The Godfather has one more of his assets, not only Marlon Brando, but Al Pacino gives us a great job in his third film role, experiencing Michael Corleone, his son Don Corleone, we have here the real protagonist of the work, we see the great change that the character expresses when at the beginning we are introduced to a young ex-combatant somewhat embarrassed or indifferent to the Family business, and at the end a great chief of the crime dealing with newly won supremacy. The end result is a grandiose film, richly illustrated in every way. A critical and public success that ended up winning three Oscars - best film, script and actor (Marlon Brando, who refused to receive the award for detesting Hollywood) and found his place among the immortal classics of cinema.

There are works in the most varied fields of art that perfectly illustrate interpersonal relationships, to which everyone should have access: in painting, the expressionism of Van Gogh and Munch; in literature, Shakespeare and Dostoevsky; in music, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven. In cinema, The Godfather is one of the examples of this very limited hall. Francis Ford Coppola's film is an epic that has become indispensable for movie fans and anyone with minimal interest in art. The Godfather is considered one of the best films ever made, influencing hundreds of other productions, with elements such as the most familiar treatment of the mafia."
10,Special respect,"Undoubtedly, it's a recurring masterpiece There was no trilogy that each of them was great But The godfather was, of course, an unrepeatable Trilogy"
10,The greatest movie ever,"Few films have left as deep a mark on cinema as The Godfather. More than just a gangster movie, it's a profound meditation on power, family, loyalty, and the corrupting force of ambition.

Plot & Themes: The film follows the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from a reluctant outsider to the cold-blooded head of the Corleone crime family. What begins as a story about the aging Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) evolves into a complex and tragic tale of legacy and identity. Coppola doesn't glamorize violence-he humanizes it, showing how it tears apart both the victims and the perpetrators.

Performances: Marlon Brando delivers one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history. His portrayal of Don Vito is haunting, calm, and commanding. Al Pacino's slow-burn transformation is masterful; you almost don't notice the shift until he becomes someone you no longer recognize. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton all add depth and tension to the narrative.

Direction & Cinematography: Coppola's direction is elegant and deliberate. Every frame is meticulously composed, and Gordon Willis's shadowy cinematography adds to the film's mythic atmosphere. The pacing, though slow by modern standards, allows the weight of each moment to truly land.

Score: Nino Rota's score is unforgettable-its melancholic waltz becoming synonymous with both beauty and brutality. It ties the entire film together with a tragic, almost operatic tone.

Legacy: The Godfather isn't just one of the greatest films ever made-it redefined American cinema. Its influence can be felt in everything from The Sopranos to Breaking Bad. It's a film that demands your full attention, then rewards it with something timeless."
10,A true classic in which you forget you're watching a movie,"What makes this movie so great is that the characters seem to leap off the screen, often after only a few minutes. I've never quite figured it out, but it's as if you already know these guys, their habits, their mannerisms, their strengths and faults. Like Clemenza, a guy you hate to love - he'd just as easily kill you as he would pick a weed off his lawn, yet you can't help but respect him. Respect him? What am I saying? But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary. Oddly enough, the only person who seems an ill fit is Michael, at the start that is. How can anyone so clean cut be related? But Pacino makes it work (unbelievable acting) and nothing is more engaging that watching the 'transformation' he goes through as he becomes the Don."
10,The most greatest gangster movie,"""Never hate your enemies,It affect your judgement"" The most greatest gangster movie which a man can't miss!"
10,Cult Classic,"An Example of Cult Classic,Simply A Mind Blower and An All Time Top Listed Movie. Al Pacino Was Amazing. The Whole Movie is One Hell of A Drama. The Whole time we looking forward to outcome. One of the Best Crime Dramas Ever. Screen Time of Every Actors were pitch perfect and The Script was just A Classic Script Itself."
10,Perfection!!!,"This movie is well deserved of its glittering reputation. It simply blows its would-be contenders of the same genre (ie. Goodfellas, Casino etc.) out of the water. It is perfect in every way, from the flawless acting to the stunning cinematography. I think you would be hard pressed to find a Marlon Brando movie, an Al Pacino movie, a James Caan movie, a Robert Duval movie or a Diane Keaton movie where they turn out a better performance. And I think that the credit for all of this has to go to the films director, Francis Ford Coppola. And anyone who tries to tell you that this movie is anything less that the greatest single piece of cinema of all time simply does not know what they are talking about (although the Godfather part 2 comes extremely close...). So I plead with you, please, please, please go out and rent (or even better, BUY!) this film, even if you have read the book (although if you have done that I suspect you will have seen the movie too!) because I guarantee you will fall in love with it."
10,Perfect.,"This is the closest film of being perfect out of all of the films. Great story and a fantastic directing, on top of that an amazing cast. This film never disappoints anybody. A true masterpiece that captivates the viewer."
9,Stunning!!,"Most of the superlatives have been said about this Movie, adjectives such as magnificent, brilliant and searing all attach themselves to most reviews of the Film and, deservedly so. The Godfather is the definative story of the Mafia and it's bid for legitimacy and respect from Political allies and Law Enforcement groups eager to sympathize in order to capitalize. While the show is informing us, or rather reminding us of time honoured liaisons between the law makers and the law breakers in mid 20th Century America, with scenes of Movie Producers waking up and finding parts of a horses' anatomy sharing satin sheets, employees of the Don getting garrotted in public bars and front seats of company vehicles, the hazards of stopping your car at toll booths, and Police Captains choking over bits of lead during their meal, we learn also of the significence of that well worn cliche..........'Give him an offer he can't refuse.' Yeah..... bloodthirsty stuff indeed, but apparently stuff we all enjoy watching, particularly when it's directed by guys like Francis Coppola and embellished with stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall. The Godfather is a milestone Movie, superbly adapted from Mario Puzo's book that dares to explore the depth of Mafia guilt and Political conscience."
10,Why Are Some People Hating On This Movie?,"Okay,I've got to say,this is the best movie of all time.It's got story,great acting,and memorable scenes.First of all,the movie is about Michael Corleone's transformation from an innocent to a mafia don.And I grew up with MTV,so I'm not just high,okay? Besides,Michael learned the ropes because of his father,who was in the mafia,idiots.And for the user who said that this is typical American trash,I've got to say:.In fact,you're lucky we have movies that don't revolve around tea drinking crumpet eating idiots who just sit around the whole time talking about their day at the country club.And besides,British actors SUCK!But back to the point,the Godfather is THE best movie of all time,and if you don't agree,then IDC,you're an idiot,or a pot smoker.Thanks for reading!And if you have any intellectual response to this,please post."
10,A MASTERPIECE,NO NEED TO SAY ANYTHING TO PROMOTE THIS MOVIE. A CLASSIC.
10,Perfection,"I just watched this on Netflix. Can't remember if i'd ever seen it but that's a good thing. I could compare it to modern cinema in a fresh way and I must say, despite the 3 hour length I was captivated the whole way through! Al Pacino and Brando brought this one home."
10,La Famigghia,"Probably my favourite film ever made since it perfectly represents what happens in reality in the country of Italy, where i'm from. The film is dark, real , sublime, poetic. Happy to be italian an never offend an Italian's family it's not worth it."
10,opinion,"It is one of the best books and movie that i read and watch. I've read them to learn something from them, to learn how to live in the broadest sense of the term, and there were books which offered me support. I agree with other reviews, this movie also has great Gifs. Most watch and read."
9,A Masterpiece,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role."
10,So.... Why can't modern films be more like this masterpiece?!,"So if you asked me what was one of the best films of all time, guess what I would say? The Godfather! My experience with the godfather began all the way back when I was a little kid. I would watch scenes of this movie all the way from 9 years ago. The main reason I love this film, is because it managed to get a book with uncountable sub plots, and turn it into a film with only one plot, Michael's. The way the movie follows Michael, and shows his subtle change through ingenious imagery, and slow but interesting dialogue, into by the end of the film, the big man himself.And its not like Michael hogs the movie or anything, he allows space for Sonny and Vito to grow in, and even for minor characters to give outstanding jobs acting. Another thing, the acting. Oh my god, the acting in this film is phenomenally amazing! It shows you that you can get a bit of the character, dig a hole in it, pour a bit of yourself in to it, and you have yourself a great character, with you playing as it. God! What performances. Brando's performance as Vito, is a textbook case of too good an actor-itis. Not only does the film manage to get something classical like dialogue from the book, and add its own unique style of being calm, but yelling through the words you are saying. Also, the dialogue from this movie, is something so ahead of its time, -Sigh-it's so good. There is no real legitimate criticism I can give The Godfather, besides the fact that it took some sub plots and characters I loved from the book, and chopped them out of the film for a faster run time, which is fine, since the movie is like 4 hours long. I can't tell you much more about the film without giving it away, which would be really messed up as it is a must watch film. It's good. It's the pinnacle of cinema. The zenith of movies. Just watch it it's so great."
10,Unforgettable film,"The best drama I've ever seen. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando had amazing performances. This has been the most important role for Al Pacino, and he has achieved the fame with this movie. I like very much the Vito Corleone's voice and role. It's unforgettable. I like the Robert Duvall's role too. The plot is very interesting and thought provoking. It has many elements like drama situations, crimes, and romances too. I also think that this is the best crime movie about Sicilian mafia. When I was watching the film for the first time, I was paying much attention and trying to figure it out. Maybe, you have to watch it two times at least for best understanding.

For me, this is the best Francis Ford Coppola's movie. He has known how to adapt the Mario Puzo's novel to the wide screen. The Godfather II is good as well, so any of them can be your favorite. I highly recommend this movie, and I'm sure you will want to see it many times. It lasts about 3 hours, but you won't feel it. Now, you have to plan to see this movie and enjoy. Then you could watch Godfather II and III if you want more."
10,The Best!,"The best of the series ever. Rearing up of American Cinema started after the production of this Movie. This compelling movie of mafia and family life is superb in every department, writing, acting, directing, a highlight of Coppola's career as well as of New American Cinema. Don't miss an opportunity to see a classic such as this on the big screen. The Godfather films remain so powerful, so ubiquitous, because in the Corleones we see the American Dream -- and in turn, ourselves. So it's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the ""Godfather"" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're also cultural touchstones. El grand!"
10,The Standard for Modern Masterpieces,"The Godfather is a timeless Dime that isn't afraid of slow pacing storytelling or trying something new (1972). Thoughtful Camera work and an epic tale leave many including myself glued to the screen as every scene is articulated in such a way that screams perfection. Casting Crew hit the goldmine with this one as Brando, Pacino, and James Caan Should be an illegal combination. No more should be said except perfection."
10,Flawless movie! Best trilogy ever made,"I mostly love the first part! I can easily say the best movie ever made. Actors are amazing, the writing is brilliant 10/10! 100% Worth watching"
9,A masterpiece,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.

The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.

The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis."
10,"Unfortunately, this movie is perfect!","The only defect of this movie is that it is perfect. The fact is that there's nothing more irritating in a movie than the unanimity. When someone hears that a movie is perfect, the best of history, etc... he/her creates expectations so high that no movie can ever fulfil. This movie is the case. Every single detail is crafted to perfection. Mario Puzo gave it the tense and realistic plot. Coppola gave it the dignity. Brando gave it the genius. Nino Rota gave it the passion...

Well, if you didn't see this movie, you are a very lucky person. You have the privilege of being able to see it for the first time and no experience can be stronger than the first one. But, first of all, forget all opinions about this movie. Don't create any expectation. Forget even this comment. And don't thank me for it. Just love ""The Godfather""."
10,Best movie of all time,"I couldn't believe what people, critics, movie-sites are saying about it, cause I didn't think that one movie could have it all. But it had it, it deserved all what people was saying about and I am just proud to be writing a review on ;in my opinion, one of the greatest movies EVER made 'The Godfather'. What can I say...I never saw just a combination between action and drama in one movie, so I could say that the plot is definitely the best I've ever watched and may be will ever watch. Actors' performances were perfect, I mean what do you think of Al Pacino or even the better Marlon Brando's performance in any other movie? well, they were at their finest and reached their top acting talent in this movie. Also James Caan made a remarkable performance and especially that scene when he dies. Even the soundtrack and the main theme for the movie, I think nobody could ever forget this music and how it did fit the movie and the drama. By winning only 3 Oscars, I think that the academy awards really did underestimate 'The Godfather' as I believe that it deserves to be the most Oscar-winning movie in its year and may be one of the most ever....I just feel that whatever I'll say won't afford to describe such a legendary movie, but I must say that I recommend this to ANYONE who only wanna watch an excellent movie...."
10,Perfect,I want to live like in this movie. This is very cool.
9,One of greatest films of all time,This film is a masterpiece in every way. The score is perfect. The cast's preformence in the film was perfect. The cinematography was perfect. Overall it's a masterpeice
10,A masterpiece of cinema. One of the greatest films of all time.,"Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic ""The Godfather"", which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why. The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"", Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the ""innocent"" son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" as the adviser to the Don. The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.

The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway. It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family. I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who haven't seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie ""you cant refuse"" to see. The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is ""Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"".

The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam ""Boom Boom"" Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.

This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time. This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family."
10,absolutely awesome,"The best movie of Godfather's series, Marlon Brando's performance is perfect. The Godfather is a masterpiece of epic proportions."
10,This is what Movie - Making is all about.,"Forget special effects, ignore high pitched whines and scenes of unreal blood and gore, this is what movie-making is really about.

Top notch acting by all key players - Brando, Pacino, and the awesome cast. A haunting music score that reverberates in your mind through the years. A screenplay that never lets up. And a rollicking great story.

Nothing can take away from the impact of the dead stallion in the movie producer's bed. Or the simple tension evident in Pacino's demeanour during the famous dinner with Salozzo.

I must have watched this movie over a hundred times. You know what, I'll probably see it a few score times more. This one is never going to be topped.

Extraordinary!!"
10,Best movie of all time,"This movie really did change my life. It was absolutely breathtaking and so complete in film quality. I have never seen so flimed and completed so well and there was a near perfect movie of that type, it would be the Godfather. You look at the cast of people in this movie and these people were made stars because of this movie or already were stars; Al Pacino,James Caan, Marlon Brando, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and the list goes on. The storyline was unbelievable with a plot that was constantly evolving and the commitment to accuracy and staying true to Puzo's novel written years earlier. People actually spoke Italian in this movie and you really felt that they were their characters because they sold it to you that well. I still look at Brando, Caan and Pacino and say, ""Your the Godfather who started it all, your Sonny with rage and ferocity and Pacino is the up and coming Godfather who is the most sinister and clever Godfather there ever was."""
10,Poetry in Motion,"True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. Top notch movie with great cinematic visuals."
10,Best movie ever,"It's a great movie which shows very well the structure and working methods of the Italian-American mafia. The excellent interpretation of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and all the others makes this movie one you must see. The great screenplay based in the Mario Puzo's novel gives to this movie a very strong story. You can also see a very good representation of the Italian lifestyle in the USA and the original Sicilian mafia. Each character has his own presence and they interact as in the real life. For me it's probably the best movie of the history, followed by the second and third part of the Mario Puzo's story."
10,You will respect the Al Pacino!,"It is by far the most intense, reality based movie I have ever seen. If you've never seen Al Pacino, this is the the movie to begin with."
10,Appreciating how good the movie is.,"If you are one of those film-goers who do not have a long attention span, are not able to digest more comlicated dialogue and only appreciate mindless action thrillers then this film is not for you. For the rest of us it is the greatest movie ever made. 10/10"
9,Top 10 Films,"Everything is great! I don't know how to describe this movie. One thing for sure that this movie is aging like a fine wine. Someday in the future you watch this one more time and you won't be dissapointed, truly a masterpiece from Coppola."

9,classic,"If there is one link in ""godfather"" that is related to fate, it is love. In such a man-dominated film, full of killing and yin. Mou, brotherly feelings, family feelings, love this thing seems to be just an optional embellishment. But when you go deep into the godfather's story, you will find that this seemingly insignificant wind and snow is sometimes a decisive link.

Mike is, to some extent, the most similar to his father among several sons. Closed inside, it is difficult to see what he really thinks, whether to his career or love; he is loyal to marriage and does not have an erosive private life like Sonny and Fredo. Many people say that Mike's greatest fate tragedy was the death of Apollo, which led him to marry an inappropriate woman, Kay. But maybe that's what Mario Puzzo is trying to tell us, some truth.

Kay and Mike met when they were students, or when he was in the army, it was not important in time, but what was important was that they met Mike in his green and ideal youth. Mike of that period, returned from World War II, the National Medal, handsome and gentle, always humble and courteous to people. He will spend Christmas with Kay after watching the movie and change his face as soon as he finds Kay's wrong face.

Say, ""No, you're Ingrid Bergman. I won't love you more."" If he wanted Kay to take pictures with her family at his sister's wedding, even if she was just a new girlfriend, he would say seriously and tenaciously, ""Kay, this is my family, not me."" I really like him at that time, the kind of fixed eyes for their own future, gentle expression, smiling face. But fate mercilessly went to the assassination, arousing Mike's deep family feelings, and made him go. There's no way back.

He left the United States helplessly and took refuge in his hometown of Sicily. With the godfather's theme song L ove

Theme, Mike walked on the beautiful and primitive Sicilian hillside, when Mike had completed the transformation of his life. He killed his enemy and fled to his hometown. Even though his face was still so handsome, something in his eyes had changed. He no longer has an innocent manner of tenderness. When. When the man who took care of him drove to the hillside to find him and told him not to walk around, he just said calmly, ""I want to see the village of Colion and walk."" There was no hesitation or temptation. By this time he was no longer the pure college student, and had become a young emperor.

In other words, this passage in Sicily is an important transition period in Mike's life. Before he came, he was a pure young man who suddenly killed his enemies and began to transform; and in Sicily, far from the sinful world, his character had begun to change, but he still had good wishes. And with the death of Apollo, at the end of his exile, Mike returned to New York, and the picture of the plot was depressing black. He found Kay and hoped to marry her, but by this time Mike had completely transformed into a new generation of godfather in his heart, and innocence had long been gone.

Maybe that's what we love about Sicily. Because it's too beautiful, as beautiful as Apollo.-it's pure. Mike was completely fascinated by her at first sight. Some people say that this kind of love is not a deep love, but a visual shock, an impulse. But I think she's the kind of woman who fits Mike during the metamorphosis."
10,Şaheser,I rarely deserve ten points for both dialogues and events I do not think you can watch movies Vito my father Allah mercy so tenth place and place their designs are so good that they go to Michael's Sicily Congratulations on how well I met you Mario Puzo I congratulate you on making a very successful production
10,Superb!,A masterpiece that will never had any other film to be compared with truth be told!
10,among the top5,"if you want to laugh, get the naked gun or mister bean; if you want adrenaline flushing through your veins, look for starship troopers or an arnie flick; if you want to cry, watch... i don't know, Meryl Streep? but if you want an the film you gotta see this. it has everything necessary to automatically be considered as THE ONE. the plot, the acting and actors (i love pacino, caan & duvall), the music, shocking scenes, etc. if you haven't seen it, well, what in the world are you waiting for? but, i hope you have enough time"
10,The Godfather; Pure Movie Gold,"If you are only able to watch two movies this lifetime, this is one half of them. The Godfather is pure movie gold, a flawless masterpiece that only ripens with age. It'll just blow your mind how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously good this movie is. The other movie you must watch is the godfather's brother. The Godfather Part II. These two movies combine to make such a movie experience that cannot be simply explained with words. No other movie series has complimented each other better than these two movies, they fit together like a two piece puzzle. Begin a better life right now, watch the Godfather 1 & 2. You don't have to watch the third if you don't want. It's...not that good."
10,LESSONS TAUGHT FROM MY DAD,THE MOVIE AWESOME THE WRITING AND ACTORS AMAZING! THE LIFE LESSONS I LEARNED WATCHING LIFE CHANGING! THIS A MOVIE I WATCHED EVERY YEAR WITH MY FATHER SINCE I WAS A SMALL CHILD. EVERY YEAR I WATCH THIS MOVIE I LEARN SOMETHING NEW ABOUT BUSINESS FAMILY LIFE AND SACRAFICE.
9,Amazing,"A fantastic movie. Its moving and gritty storyline takes you through a wide range of emotions: happy, sad, angry, and fearful, although you can never feel for the characters. (For obvious reasons). I liked the sequel personally better, but not by much. The series should have stopped at #2, because Mario Puzzo's novel spanned the first 2 movies. See it instead of sitting at your computer all day. Now."
10,Work of art,"Among the all time greats for sure. As a major mafia/gangster movie fan, this may be my favorite and easily a top 5 of all movies I've ever seen in general. See all other top reviews for more sophisticated descriptions."
10,A love letter to the film industry,"I've been trying to watch this film for over a year. After hearing everyone claiming that this is the best movie of all time, I just thought that they were overating it. Now that I've watched it, I'll tell you that I should've listen to them before.

Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the best scripted and put together pieces of art of all time. When you embrace the film, its world welcomes you like any other mobster. You feel in your own body those feelings that the characters portray.

Not only that, the scenography, music and dialogs really makes you feel like one with the movie. It's all marvelously crafted and delivered that you just lose yourself in The Godfather's world. Every single scene feels like it has been carefully written, meticulously put together and gracefully delivered.

Not to mention the work the actors. They just embrace the characters as themselves, the atmosphere that's created within the set gets transported into your own life. This movie is beyond every other works, it's different and unique, it's clean and it's clearly done with love and caress.

Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch it."
9,perfect,"Very very well movie.

And very conceptual and beautiful film."
9,Such a very nice movie,"The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.-srijanarora-152-448595."
8,A true classic!,"This almost flawless piece of art follows the Corleone family through their involvement in the mafia. It perfectly depicts both the business and family sides of life in the mafia. The only downside to the film is, that for someone not engaged in the history and depth of the story that is being told, it may come across as boring."
10,Amazing film,The Godfather is One of the most great films in the world.
10,Genius,This is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen this and Godfather 2 over a dozen times! It's a timeless and perfect movie.
9,A culpable masterpiece from the Master,"This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre.

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to a ruthless mafia boss."
9,That´s just the way we are,Quiet but exciting. Nasty at some moments but soft and tender at the same time in others. People being fair and cruel simultaneously. It´s just the way life is.Wonderful All the stuff is perfect. Perfect sound and music. One of the best photography ever made in Hollywood. Excellent rihtm of the happenings. None of the actors is less than perfect.
8,The Godfather so well,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. I love and watch every month at least once.

Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects....."
10,The greatest landmark on American cinema.,"The Godfather is great. For almost thirty years now audiences have been captivated and intrigued by the Corleone family. And no other mafia movie has ever come as close to being this good. The story is just amazing and the directing by Francis Ford Coppola is nothing less than spectacular. Coppola has taken the concept of organized crime in America, something that was once looked down upon, and has built a cult following around it, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as their leading figures. And I don't think any single film has produced as many memorable scenes as The Godfather. Who could ever forget Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, buying those oranges on that fateful day? Or James Caan, as Sonny Corleone, getting massacred by the barrage of machine-gun bullets? And lines that will forever be repeated by fans like, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The bottom line is that The Godfather has changed the way we look and judge films. It has made cool what is sinful, crime a family value, and dynamic characters the modern-day icons of several generations of storytelling in film. Alongside all the revolutionary pictures of all time, The Godfather earns it place at the very top. Whether it is the #3 greatest film by the American Film Institute, #1 by IMDb, or #2 by me, this movie should very well be agreed by all to be a landmark in American film history."
10,This film is definitely an offer you can't refuse,The Godfather is definitely my favourite film of all time. It is never boring. Brando's best. He won an Oscar. The film is absolutely irrisistible. It's original and is perfect on the telling of a mafia empire falling down because of a deal that was turned down. Pacino became a star for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. This is James Caan's best film and is the only film that got him an academy award nomination. Other people that became noticeable are Robert Duvall and John Cazale. For sure it is a 10. I recommend it to everyone. It is not a film to say no to because everything is going right down the line. I am sure it will not be a turn down. I am saying this because I know that it is one of the best films created. It was #3 on #100 of the afi's top 100 films list.
10,Excellence!,"A true cinematic masterpiece! A movie that holds up strongly through time. Brando's performance was impeccable! One of the best casts in the history of cinema. This movie was done with the passion that lacks on film making nowadays and thats why it will live forever. It deals with the core of society through a dangerous and loving family. There is just a few film makers out there that keep this true formula alive today and let's hope there is more to come. Coppola has yet to come back and delight us with more. We need more movies like this! Get inspired filmmakers, the world is yours. A movie that changed American film making forever."
10,The most beatiful movie,"If you watch this movie , you will see the real world. The real world is not like you think... the real world 99% you can see it , and learn from this movie... You have to watch this movie 100% !

Best Regards"
10,A masterpiece of cinematography,"The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematography and one of the greatest adaptations of a novel in movie history,"
10,My opinion,"One of the best ganasters movie ever, thanks to my dad i know about this movie, love it"
10,A masterpiece that lacks universalism,"The Godfather is literally the most highly rated movie of all time. I liked this movie, adored it. And with all the respect that I have for this heavyweight striking flick, my sub- conscience tells me that there seems to be an overrating that simply has been unable to be tamed down for years. First of all, this is a great gangster movie with the most common characteristics of a mafia circuit. Superb acting is harshly evident with a small dose of surrealism. This is everything a true-life movie needs to have. But, still, I think that this is somehow one-dimensional and self-appreciative. It doesn't have a universal sense of mafia mob but remains within the confines of a single direction of storytelling. It concentrates on the Italian mob, a single family and no further. It depicts, marvelously, the structure of that-time mafia entourage and the set of rules it was based upon. However, I think there have been several other movies which, if not as subtly as The Godfather, precisely have managed go beyond the classic understanding of mafia and grasped a wider span of this topic. Anyway, The Godfather, though overrated, still remains self-contained and deserves to be one of the best but with all this time having passed by, not the best one. 10/10"
8,Amazing,"Very interesting story, great plot , great script, and amazing actors ! I don't think we could see a perfect movie like this in many years to come Im glad I finally watched it"
10,A movie that can never be duplicated.,"If you ever imagined a real life portrayal in the life of the godfather and families look no further. I'm writing what we all have said and all already know and that's that this movie has an amazing plot, script, music, and actors. Again no further if you really want to watch amazing classic that will never again in history be remade."
10,"An extraordinary film, but not a perfect one","The Godfather is generally considered one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion this stands, however it is nowhere near perfect. Most of the acting is very good, such as Marlon Brando's and Robert Duvall's performances, however Al Pacino's and Diane Keaton's performances are lacking. Talia Shire and James Caan give good performances, but not as remarkable as Brando's. The atmosphere of the movie is aided by the darkness in some of the settings, particularly those of the house. The film, on the other hand, is slightly too long . Some of the scenes could have been cut, and some sequences shortened, and the result would have been better. All in all this is a spectacular movie, which I urge you to see, but it is somewhat flawed."
9,"Wait, films like this used to exist in the 70's?","I'm gonna be a little too honest here. I only watched The Godfather in peer pressure. I don't even like old Hollywood films. I always start feeling drowsy while watching them. Not only is the camera quality too bleak, but the accent of the time was also very illegible. But this one was fun to watch. I saw it on Prime Video and took multiple sittings to watch this. I finished it 6 months ago but I remember seeing it like it was yesterday. Being from India, I have always thought of 70's films to be very family friendly and musical. But this isn't one of them. This one, in simple words, is metal.

The Godfather is probably what has inspired an entire genre of crime films. It is like what Star Wars is to fantasy, or what Superman is to the superhero genre (man, all 70's films have been so revolutionary in Hollywood). The whole idea of two groups of mafia fighting out each other in the most brutal way possible gave rise to Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Gangs of Wasseypur, the Mafia game trilogy, and even this film's two sequels. That is the amount of cultural impact this film has left. Don Corleone has become a household name now.

The action scenes, the music, the acting, everything is legendary. I legit screamed at the scene where they put the horse's head in that man's bed. We see many times people learning acting by watching The Godfather films. The only problem I had, however, was what I said in the beginning of the review. The sound is not clear at all. When Vito Corleone speaks he sounds like he is swishing saliva in his mouth like a washing machine. It almost feels like the captions are saying something completely different from what the captions are saying. I finally gave up and switched to Hindi because the English ADR was so bad.

I really wish The Godfather was a standalone film. It has one of the most satisfying ending in all the old films. It really didn't need those terrible sequels which don't even have a Hindi dub. Although it has been almost 50 years since it released, it still feels like it would spark outrage among certain sections if a Bollywood adaptation would be made. Definitely way ahead of its time. I would have recommended it to everyone, except everyone I know is either not interested in cinematography or has already seen it."
9,"Just be patient, you will be feel good soon","First of all some positive things :- The background music supported visuals so well and create a retro or soothing feeling in start.

The most impressive thing is POLITICS between five dons. How hierarchy changed, internal conflicts, never trust anyone, strategies and tactics - and all political stuff is here.

Character development is also good with story plotting.

Now some negative things :- The biggest negative point of this movie is its length of 3hrs as i have not a habit of that much sitting and fixing my eyes on screen.

There are no subtitles provided while speaking Italian.

There are some minor mistakes, but i think that can be easily ignored.

And as i said i don't usually watch movie of that much length that's why, if you can't put brain on even one scene properly- then it becomes confusing.

That's all from my side .. hope you like it."
10,A lesson from father to sons,"Masterpiece movie I have introduced The Godfather trilogy to my two sons with 9 and 7 yrs old 8 years ago. in the beginning, they understood nothing but captured the main message: The father is a wise and respectable man. Nowadays, every time this movie is broadcasting at cable TVs or movie portals, both stopped what they are doing to watch saying the Marlon Brando scripts. My legacy was passed to them by these 3 movies. Marcos."
10,Incredible is an understatement...,"The Godfather is an absolutely fantastic movie. There is nothing I can say that is negative about this masterpiece. The acting is more than perfect... Al Pacino gives an amazing performance, one of the best in movie history. I can't say anything negative about this movie... It might be perfect... IT IS!!! But if you haven't seen this wonderful part of movie history, you MUST go to the nearest video club AND GET IT!!! I don't think I have added anything to the collection of positive reviews, but THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!

101%... Great, great, great, great, great..."
10,One of the few films that are adapted from a book and the adaption is better then the book itself,"The 1st instalment of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather is considered by many to be in the top 50 films of all time. It has everything you want in an all time classic, with exceptional acting from the likes of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall. Mario Puzo's classic novel adaption delivers one of the few adaptations of a book that's better than the book itself. With perfect soundtrack, perfect dialogue and perfect acting, Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the best films you will ever see in cinema history."
10,An amazing movie I ever seen,"From the beginning the addiction of watching movie I ever found this, one of the best movie."
10,Storytelling,"This is one of the most valuable pieces of content available for creators to learn storytelling. Featuring a superb plot, screenplay, and dialogue, the movie delivers 100% entertainment to viewers."
10,Gold Collection,One of the greatest movies ever made. I can watch it every day.
9,Great Movie,"It contains many metaphors about life and you can learn from it. Great acting, great shots and an excellent movie. The acting is like something out of a real crime world. You will get a different taste every time you watch it. It inspired many crime movies and TV series to be shot later with its characters, shooting and subject. If you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely watch the movie as soon as possible. Of course, don't forget to watch the sequel. As a whole, it is a masterpiece. Of course, I advise you not to take these as a positive example in your life, but to take them wisely."
10,Perfect,"The godfather is a perfect film, nothing lacks an excellent cinematography, masterful performances and a message never betrays the family."
10,Godfather or a masterpiece...,"The *Godfather* films are masterpieces, widely studied in film schools around the world. Michael Corleone, the main character, is a deeply rich and three-dimensional figure, defined by his principles as he undergoes significant character arcs throughout the story. The narrative flow in *The Godfather* is exceptional, and the story world is meticulously crafted. By the end, all plot threads are seamlessly connected, and every question raised in the beginning is answered in a satisfying and cohesive way."
10,Simply irresistible masterpiece,"The best movie of the seventies and one of my personal top five movies of the 20th century, and perhaps the best american movie of all time. It is a very good description of the mafia life in the USA in the middle of the 20th century. Everything in this movie is masterful: the direction, the script which is based on the hit novel ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo, the fantastic music, the cinematography and last but certainly not least the superb actors in it. Marlon Brando is magnificent as the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and got a very well deserved oscar for his superb portrayal (This is one of the best parts of the movie history and he is unforgettable as the patriarch of the Mob family), Al Pacino is also very good in the role of Michael Corleone (this role marked the beginning of his elegant career), James Caan is good as Sonny, academy award winner Robert Duvall is also unforgettable as Tom Hagen and Academy Award Actress Diane Keaton is very good as Kay. This is one superb movie for all those who are truly historic masterpiece movie fans and for those which like the best of the best in the movie history. This movie is one of the very best. An unforgettable movie experience"
10,Great,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received."
10,Great movie for 1972,"It's a great film which create on 1972, I've seen it, and it changes my life. So I think you must watch this film in one time in your life. Before you watch, i suggestion you grab a popcorn and watch with your partner."
9,Impressive,"The movie is so so amazing,you can never afford missing this i tell you."
10,One of the best,It is really one of the best movies. Have been watching this movie for years since I was a kid.
10,A classical classic. Recommend,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Especially is a recommended for watching, if you like the vibe of mafia stories.

The film deeply immerses you in the atmosphere of the mafia. Many different aspects of their lives, and the code of honor, are beautifully covered.

Interesting arc of the main character.

Unsurpassed performance of the main cast.

The atmosphere of the film keeps you in suspense from the beginning to the end, at the same time swinging on an emotional swing. The attitude towards the characters changes several times throughout the film.

The characters and their motivation are interestingly written."
9,Nice Movie,"I like this movie very much from start till end. So thrilling, exciting and attention catching movie. I really enjoyed a lot watching this movie."
10,Brilliant,"My reviews are designed to be short, sweet and to the point and this is my first! Superb cast, all the actors played their characters convincingly and with authority. Some people may find the length of the film too long but in my opinion there isn't a dull moment. This film is both classy and brutal at the same time and nothing and nobody should turn down an offer they cannot refuse.

Considering the problems encountered in the making of the film, Coppola does a fine job and the film is a well deserved masterpiece that should be in everybody's collection. All I can say to you now is, if you haven't seen it yet, go and buy it!"
10,One of my top 5,I have watched this movie lot of times and It seems to impress me each time with it's story and cinematography.
10,Most accurate,This is the most accurate mob movie of all time. Nothing even comes closer to the actual mob than this movie right here.
10,For Me it's worth of time,"Such a excellent movie i had seen ever. It's defiantly worth your time.

""The Godfather"" is a 1972 crime / drama movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name . This movie is basically about the Corleone family under the patriarch , Vito Corleone also known as Godfather . When Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business a series of events takes place resulting in the assassination attempts on Don Corleone and leading his youngest Michael Corleone who is also a war hero to rise and take over his business . The role of Michael is played by one of most classy and finest actor for this movie Al Pacino who is famous for his intense and intriguing acting . The Retro look and the sophisticated scenes made this movie a true masterpiece . It took us back to the time when these Mafia's family really existed and showed us how much influence they holded at that time .

For me godfather is more than movie, an historic moment really shaped the quality of cinema and the influence over the people for generations to come. This is movie holds a special place in my heart."
9,Classic,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.

Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimised or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.

Best for ever."
10,America is wonderful,"I am a chinese man and find that america has a beautiful culture, and this movie show the struggle of being an immigrant and having to struggle to live the american dream which is not easy. You can thrive in this land or die trying. Must watch!"
10,The greatest,"10/10. It was an absolutely mind-blowing experience. He performances by the cast, were fantastic. The visuals and special effects were also top-notch and added to the overall immersive experience. The story was well-written and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I highly recommend ""Inception"" to anyone who enjoys a thrilling and thought-provoking film. The visuals and special effects were also top-notch and added to the overall immersive experience. The story was well-written and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I highly recommend ""Inception"" to anyone who enjoys a thrilling and thought-provoking film."
10,This is one of my favorite movies ever.,"I always thought that the godfather was kind of boring until I watched it this past year. I never fully grasped the idea of the mob. Also I couldn't get past the first half hour. But once I did I went on to watch the second and then the third one too. This movie is filled with drama, action and gore. If you love gun action and movies with deception you'll love how things play out in this movie. There isn't any comedy in my opinion only great sayings that stick with you and great scenes. If you have ever seen ""you've got mail"" and the godfather you'll know that if your a guy it is essential to see this movie. If you don't see it, you will be missing out on the best movie of all time."
9,perfectly organised crime,Outstanding family portrait .this movie is a piece of art 100% i recommand
10,The Most Re-Viewable Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Of all the movies I have ever seen, nothing draws me in like The Godfather. Is spite of the fact that I rarely like to watch a movie more than once every five years, whenever I am flipping through the channels on cable, and I come across this movie I am always compelled to stop and watch. Regardless of what I had planned to do seldom do I get up before the movie is over.

There are so many layers to this movie. There are many different levels on which it can be appreciated. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD."
10,Great movie,"Is The Godfather a candidate for the best movie of all time and a masterclass in filmmaking? I'd make the argument that this is the gangster movie par excellence.

You don't need to worry; the time will fly by and you won't even realize the movie is almost three hours long.

With such high production values and stunning visuals throughout, the film, which is over fifty years old, puts many contemporary movies to shame.

I could list many more Great performances-Brandon, Pacino, and Castellano are just a few.

If you're thinking about purchasing a hard copy, I would suggest the blu ray version because it is sharper than the dvd.

This."
10,The Godfather,"One of the best crime movies in cinema formats. I can watch this movie without getting bored, even if it can be compensated for Al Pacino's extraordinary acting. It also has the ability to maintain serial recording storage in the best possible way. Each movie is enjoyable in its own way. It's one of the rare movies that I want to end despite its long duration. You don't understand how time passes. He is a legend with his successful acting, unforgettable lines and music you can't get enough of. Every look of Al Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music the music took me to another world, it made me feel like I was around a mafia gang or as they say in the movie (family) 🖤🖤 10/10."
10,The best mafia movie.,"An interesting combination of a film about destinies with a film of one story. ""The Godfather"", in fact, tells about an ordinary episode from the life of several influential families, from the position of one of them. In the established business and the influence divided between the Fathers, a new source of income appears - drug trafficking. It promises fantastic incomes and promises those who agree to do it, the possibility of sole power. However, this new business has a number of drawbacks: by making profits, it scares off politicians and the police, who will not be as easy to buy as in the case of gambling houses or alcohol. In addition, some heads of families are disgusted by the sale of deadly powder. ""It's a dirty business"" (c).

The situation is developing into a counteraction, some families are negative towards the drug business, and seek to restrain it so as not to go bankrupt, other families see the future in the drug business and are ready to deal with it closely. Someone stays on the sidelines, someone enters the war. An interesting character - a Turk, a drug dealer - suspiciously similar to Efim Shifrin, serves as a catalyst in the massacre, pushes those who want to do business with him to eliminate those who want to limit his business in America. The fragile peace is broken by a whiff of power and greed. ""I am a man of a new generation"" (c).

In a three-hour film adaptation of this story, dressed in authentic (most likely) Italian traditions, Puzo and Coppola managed to show not only and not so much the history of the war of families, but the history of the people of the family. Despite the fact that the history of the war does not seem to be any, not supplemented or not disclosed, everything is in its place here, optimally woven into a leisurely plot, saturated with a cruel atmosphere of logical murders, when nothing personal, just business. Just money.

I seem to have forgotten to praise the actors' acting, directing? Well, God be with them.

The best mafia movie."
10,Top movie of alltime,"The original Godfather is an epic that will live on in world cinema until the end of time. The only movies that come even close to its brilliance are Godfather II and The Usual Suspects. It is the most griping 3 hours of cinema you will ever watch. The acting is magnificent. Brando's whispering, hoarse voice is easily identifible to people even in the present day. Pacino gets started in his brilliant career with a memorable performance as Michael Corleone here. Even James Caan as the tempermental Sonny and Robert Duvall as the wannabe son are terrific. Francis Ford Coppola cemented his place in the Hollywood hall of fame with this epic that will never be forgotten.

My rating : @@@@@ (out of five)"
10,no question,"Have you seen this movie? If you have, then you most likely have no reason why to question my rating of this movie as 10 out of 10. This movie is the greatest film of all time. As millions of people before me have said, anyone who has seen Goodfellas, Casino, or any other numerous well-made mob movies, this movie is the inspiration for those films, and if this movie had not been made, those films would not have existed. In short, you can't call yourself a film buff if you have never seen this film, or maybe you can't call yourself a film buff if you don't own this film."
10,"Not for the modern day idiot nation, but incredibly good!","I can understand why one might be bored by this film, it's three hours long and the majority of the American public can't wrap their puny minds around anything more complex than an episode of ""Friends"".

However, for anyone with an actual attention span (and i have ADD, so you should have a wider attention span than me), this film is a masterpiece. Sure it goes on for a while, but the story completely envelops you with the tension and the flavor of the tale. The symbolism is amazing as Michael Corleone's appearance slowly changes as his character changes. At the beginning of the movie, I didn't even recognize him as Al Pacino!

So, if you think that ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is a marvel in filmmaking, then you might want to pass this one by. Otherwise, it's truly wonderful!"
10,Great film!,"This Film Has Great Plot Great Dialogues,Great Acting,Beautiful Score And Cinematography. What Do You Want More? People Can attach Themselves With The Characters of This Film."
10,A classic,A movie I enjoy over and over. It does justice to the book. Never boring and excellent acting.
10,The Godfather,"One word: Awesome.

The Godfather held my interest from beginning to end. Reasons for that was the direction, the performances, the cinematography, the editing, and the storyline. Mario Puzo's book of a powerful Mafia family in New York, along with their relationship with the other fellow organized crime organizations, and the rise and fall of Don Corleone was directed with delicate efficiency and care. Marlon Brando it the star of the film, but Al Pacino was the real reason to watch the movie. His character, Michael, at first does not want to take part in the family's business, but we soon see how one punch to the face by a cop can turn the tide, and Pacino creates a well drawn character for himself to play. Francis Ford Coppola did a extraordinary job with this movie, and Brando, Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Cann gave great performances. This is one of my favorite films of all time.

10/10"
10,Awesome Movie!,Great Direction + Amazing Script. We want more movies like this.
10,The Best Picture,"Film is a epic story about Corleone family. A realy good production, realy good performances. Actually Nino Rota's musics are amazing. In the film there are a real athmosphere. I think the film will be in cinemas soon."
10,Best movie,If you want to learn leadership you have to watch this movie.
10,GOAT OF MOVIE,"I watched this in 2022, because netflix beforely not buy the license. When i watch this movie at that moment i fall in love. This movie was crazy. This movie was made at 1970 but it still relevant for us in 2022. I love you don carleone. I hope film industry can make more beautifull film like this.

My favorite scene when michael meet his wife at italy, the girl was so beautifull and michael carleone get love at the first sight, but sadly the women died in car explosive accident.

Michael become a god father was so gargerous. He is my idol, my life change after watch this movie, always be the best film ever."
10,Greatest Movie Ever!,"This is the greatest film ever to be made. I haven't seen a film that I could even compare to this film. It made me smile, it made me thrilled, it made me shed a tear and it made me think. The Godfather is a movie about families. I do not believe Hollywood will ever come out with a movie of this caliber again.

Your's Truly, Gavin Hall"
10,The best movie about Italian mafia,"The Godfather is an cult movie for a lot of reasons :

-The music of the movie is incredible, it's immersive you in the atmosphere of the movie. -Francis Ford Coppola is an incredible director. -Also, the acting of Al Pacino is amazing. He inspired you the respect he inspired to the characters of the movie.
You really understand how was organised the Italian Mafia in USA during this period, from inside and outside.
-The duration of the movie is 3 hours, that can scared you before to see it but the time get fast because of the script which is really well written.

I can't recommend this movie in off."
10,Masterpiece is an Understatement,"Francis Ford Coppola's legendary masterpiece about the Corleone Family is a must to every moviegoer. Although everybody knows it is considered one of the best films of all time, only watching can one understand the true power of this picture. Coppola succeeded in humanizing the mafia, in a way that his main character, the ruthless Vito Corleone, became one of the most beloved icons in movie history. Under his belt, Coppola had one of the best casts ever to appear together on screen. In the main role is the legendary Marlon Brando in what is probably his best performance ever. Alongside him you see the brilliant Al Pacino in his first major role, the amazing Robert Duvall and the great James Caan. The supporting cast also counts on Diane Keaton, John Cazale and Talia Shire. Thus begin the best movie franchise of all time. Sit back and watch this powerful film."
10,The Best Movie of All Time,"Action, Drama, loyalty.

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino made this movie. The perfect portrayal of an Italian mafia family, Francis Ford-Coppola did a wonderful job of encompassing every detail. A must watch classic."
8,dont get me wrong here but..,"Some say the best to ever exist, i couldnt see that.

I can never keep pace with pre-90s movies though, and taking that into account - the fact that this film is 50 years old - i have to expect different things.

For example scenes of beating and shooting are terrible but there was nothing more realistic back then.

Also humor and the ideal of the thug was so much different and in my eyes appalling.

Apart from that i ought to give credits to marlon brando as tony is on the top 3 performances, ever i am always interested in mafia movies especially in those taking place around the 50s, as i was in this story too.

My young eyes couldnt see what was it that gave the crown to this trilogy but i certainly appreciate it and will watch it again in the future."
9,One of the best,"Like the movie. A great one. I have watch all og them.

One of the strengths of the film is its masterful storytelling, which is both suspenseful and emotionally engaging. The themes of loyalty, power, and family are explored in depth, and the film's characters are richly drawn and well-developed. The cinematography, score, and attention to detail also contribute to the film's high quality.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking and one of the greatest films of all time. Its impact on popular culture is immeasurable, and it remains a must-see for fans of crime dramas and classic cinema."
10,Really is the greatest movie ever made!,"The title says it all, this is an absolute masterpiece of a movie, everything about it is perfect. To this day I cannot believe how could the filmmakers achieve the level of excellence that is present through out this whole film, from the camerawork, the performances, the sound mixing and of course the story telling it self as a whole. I can watch this movie anytime, it still provides the same amazement and fulfilment it did the first time."
9,"good, but...","The Godfather is a good movie. That's where it stops. It is not a great movie in any way. Marlon Brando gives the worst performance in the movie, being at best pedestrian in his role, and at worst immensely boring. (Laurence Olivier should have won the Oscar for Sleuth or Peter O'Toole for The Ruling Class) Mercifully, the supporting cast was excellent - Duvall and Pacino especially. Caan was good as Santino, but suffered a bit in overacting his rages. Part of the problem with this film is the book it came from - the book is about 450 pages long, and has a complete story for just about every character on screen. Unless Coppola wanted a 10 hour movie, he just couldn't do that, which I understand. I'd read the book shortly before seeing the film, and I have a lot more respect for the book. I would like to see Part Two, given that a lot of people say it is better (I can easily believe that). I gave The Godfather 8/10, because, as I said, it is a good, but not great movie. Truly great movies include Life is Beautiful, The Professional and A Clockwork Orange."
10,"simply, the best","Simply put, The Godfather is the best film ever made. From story, to direction, to screenplay, to acting, to sound and music, to editing, and in particular, to the overall importance of cinema as a medium, there is no equal to The Godfather. Only this brief paragraph is needed to voice my comments on this film; many others in and out of the movie critic circle have already written volumes on the subject.

One little parting note... A good piece of advice I always give to my friends and family whenever I hear them lamenting and complaining about poor films they have recently seen: ""whenever you start to feel that movies are not measuring up anymore, that no one is making a movie that means anything, that Hollywood is out of touch, etc., go home and watch The Godfather again. The experience will remind you of what movies, when at their absolute best, are capable of achieving."""
10,top notch movie and book,"If you saw the movie , please read the book too , the movie and the book are flawless and amazing. Even in 2022 , its a top notch ! Young alpacino is very good and the second part is the best. One of good trilogy and movies."
10,Just For Me,"Hi!! My favorite film is The GoodFather. It was made in Japan. I knew this film, when I played game. The game was collaboration with . I want to tell you! GoodFather is very interesting!

I am eleven years old, but i like all the back to future's films, they are very good, the story is very good and when i wacthed the first film, i didn't know that the film was old XD, i think the films were a little bit.

My favorite movie is Back to the Future 2. Its about a teenager that travels to the future to help his son and daugther. But he fails and has to fix the mistakes he 've done.

My favourite film is batman, because it's very fascinating."
10,Greatest ever,"Simply the best movie I have ever seen. I saw this movie as a pre-teen and have fallen more in love with it every time I've seen it since. Something about the perfection of each performance along with the dialogue, I dunno...it's just perfect. Coppola's (and Robert Evans') legacy."
10,Best movie,"I really love this movie! This is superb! Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place."
10,Best movie ever,"It is impossible to describe in words how good this work is. Incredible atmosphere, great dialogues and believable characters - it all adds up to the best movie ever."
10,Iconic,"I am presently watching this movie, I have truly lost count how many times I have seen it.

My father in law's favourite movie was Julius Caesar based on the Shakespeare play. He always remarked how they always spoke in quotes.

I have the same feeling watching the Godfather. It consists af one iconic scene after another, and the quotes line up. The young upcoming actors, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall are amazing. How Al Pacino did not win the Academy award is puzzling. However Joel Grey, who won that year for Cabaret was also truly remarkable.

To me this a movie that I can see again and again, at always remains fresh and relevant even though its over 50 years old."
10,A classic underworld movie,"A movie with definition of characters and its learning book for new movie makers. Each character played well and its still trending with movie makers .In future inspired me to make gangster movie and underworld movie .Malayalam movie is one of the industry in india and there is several movies inspired form god father, Mammotty the superstar from malayalam movie industry acted a role in movie called Bheeshmaparvam directed by stylist Director Amal neered ,that character have resemblence with father , Especially underworld scenes are on the point ,so i recommedn this movie for each movie makers."
10,The Godfather,"Watching The Godfather is an event. Clocking in at five minutes shy of three hours and having some of the most epochal dialogue in the history of film, watching The Godfather is taking part in something that has forever changed the landscape of cinema. Mario Puzo's novel that he himself helped adapt into the 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola offered a groundbreaking insight into the world of an organized crime dynasty. Highlighting the human beings associated with such death and destruction certainly took audiences by storm in the early 70's, and continues to do so today. Seeing the origin of where a number of cinema's most iconic lines came from is a truly magnificent journey, and one certainly worth the three-hour investment.

Opening with a lavish and joyful wedding scene, a certain ominousness lurks beneath the smiles. The Godfather sets its tone exquisitely in its opening moments with the introduction of ""Don"" Vito Corleone, played excellently by Marlon Brando in arguably his most celebrated role. We learn in just a few minutes from both the body language of those around him and their willingness to please that Don Corleone is an important man with immeasurable influence. His influence is so great that, on this, the day of (his) daughter's wedding, there is a list of those approved to see him. In perhaps one of the most talked about film openings, we see Brando with his oft-imitated manner of speaking and his accidental side-kick of a small cat (a stray that had wondered on the set), delivering a speech that has left an indelible imprint on pop culture since its utterance.

The Godfather came out nearly 20 years before I was even born so I have heard lines from the film repeated for years. Somehow this film has avoided oversaturation and seeing the lines delivered from the characters onscreen was as fresh as hearing them for the first time. I was amazed to learn with this viewing that The Godfather is nearly a three-hour film. It is one of the films I watch with rapt attention every time I see it and is the perfect slow burn, that it has never felt like an overlong film. The coloration achieved is mesmerizing, as I almost feel like I'm watching the intimate home movies of the family onscreen.

A brilliant and elegant score by Nino Rota captivates the audience and informs us of the mood of each scene. In an interesting way, however, it also runs a contrast to the mood onscreen. In a move that has often been imitated, but never to achieve the effect of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola juxtaposed many happy and celebratory scenes with sinister ones. The most discussed example of such juxtaposition is the scene in which Michael Corleone, expertly played by Al Pacino, is becoming a Godfather to his sister Connie's (Talia Shire) baby at the same time that he is becoming the Godfather to the Corleone family. The baptism scene taking place in a brilliant church with beautiful stained glass and a menacing echo is shown between hitmen killing associates and members of the rival families. As Michael's Godfather vows are being read, the murders are taking place to bridge the two ways in which Michael is becoming Godfather. The splicing of that scene marked the phenomenal transition of Michael being the family outsider, to the don of the Corleone family. A number of other scenes use juxtaposition in such a powerful way, most notably the scene in which a man is killed with the Statue of Liberty towering in the background, representing the freedom that was sought, but never obtained. Another such commanding display of juxtaposition is the joy of Christmas filling the air when Vito Corleone was stopping for fruit, only to be paraded with bullets in an attempt on his life. Later, the glistening Christmas trees lining the front of the hospital when the second attempt on his life was made. In an astounding feat, Francis Ford Coppola flanked such opposite compositions together many times throughout The Godfather, with the method never coming off as a stale or forced representation designed to manipulate the audience.

In addition to the powerful scenes Francis Ford Coppola engineered using juxtaposition, he made many more standout scenes. Even though I'm vegan, THAT horse head scenes is among my favorite in cinema. That unassuming Nino Rota tone filling our ears as the camera pans the outside of the lavish home and into the bed where the horse head warning now sits is a truly brilliant example of powerful filmmaking. The tollbooth scene is another nod to the directorial aptitude of Francis Ford Coppola. Despite the fact that we have watched Sonny Corleone (James Caan) act with a quick temper and more than willing to kill any obstacle to his goals, we feel remorse for his massacre as we watch him being led to his death. There is such a bond between the Corleone's and the audience that we want to see them prevail over their troubles, despite the fact that they would be more than willing to consider us as acceptable collateral damage if we happened to walk on the wrong side of the street during one of their hits. That level of audience endearment to cold-blooded murderers proves Francis Ford Coppola's mastery at directing complex human relationships.

The Godfather is, for me, the film with the best opening and closing in the history of cinema. Losing none of its steam throughout its 3-hour runtime, the opening, and closing of the film show the lengths Francis Ford Coppola traveled through his incredible telling of Mario Puzo's story. The framing from the wedding to Michael becoming the Godfather of the family is magical. The framing and use of foreground, middleground, and background of that final scene are mesmerizing and perfectly sets the tone for the continuation of Michael's story for the two sequels that follow. Multiple actors play a role in The Godfather that also serves as my personal favorite roles of theirs including James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Robert Duvall. In a film that is more tense and terrifying than my favorite horror films, The Godfather is a timeless classic that has more than earned its place on the list of best films ever made."
10,It's the restraint that makes the violence,"The Godfather is a masterclass in storytelling and direction. Coppola doesn't just tell a story about crime; he invites you into a world where every frame, every shadow, and every pause speaks volumes. The pacing is deliberate, almost methodical, letting each scene breathe and build tension. What stands out to me is how controlled everything feels. Coppola never rushes; he knows exactly when to hold back and when to strike. It's the restraint that makes the violence, when it happens, feel so much more powerful.

From a director's perspective, the transformation of Michael Corleone is what truly makes the film unforgettable. The way Coppola frames Michael's journey is almost like watching an evolution in slow motion. Al Pacino's subtle shifts in demeanor and Coppola's choice to keep the camera lingering on Michael as he descends into the family business is brilliant. It's not just the performances that make this happen; it's how Coppola uses silence, space, and light to emphasize his isolation and eventual dominance."
10,"For me, This is The Best Movie of All Time","The Best Movie in History, its a beautifully crafted gangster film that highlights faith, family, and power. A lesson in filmmaking is sampled from many ivy league and big ten schools to highlight a new direction in storytelling in American cinema."
10,Best movie so far,For me everyone should watch this one time in your life and you never regret. This movie has everything in a good movie. I dont want to talk about information of this movie because i dont want to spoil. That all i want to say. Just watch this OKAY.
9,A masterful adaptation that turned into one of the best movies of all time,"This film, based on the legendary book by author Mario Puzo, is a prime example of movie making and the potential of Hollywood-flicks.

Helmed by the fantastic Francis Ford Coppola, who of course has an impressive legacy to account for in terms of all of his works - it followed the novel closely, but, like any good adaptation, made it into its own thing rather than an exact retreading. We are given an insight into the lives of the Siccilian mob in America during the post-ww2 area through the Corelone family, its most notable members being the leads played by Al Pacino and his father Marlon Brando. The Oscars received were of course completely justified, Brando, being at his peak during the 50s and 60s, sells it in this one and gives the performance of a life time. Don Vito Corleone stands as one of the most iconic movie characters of all time.

Pacino, though at his height in the sequel, is still fantastic in this one, playing a man who is tragically dragged into a life destined for him that he never wanted.

The cinematography is fantastic, and so is the writing - it is a sophisticated, yet very violent and melachonical story that does not shy away from ruthlesness, one of the best scenes being towards the end of the third act, which I will not spoil here.

It stands as one of the highest rated movies on IMDb's 250 list of best movies of all time, which is not an overstatement in any way. Coppola made movie history with this story, and the best (and worst) was yet to come with the movie's sequels, but more of that later..."
10,this is the film that made me fall in love with movies,"I am not going to tell you why I think this film is great. There are very few films that have been discussed so intently as this one (Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the only two that come to mind that might be more respected) and there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Also, I'm not going to try and change your mind, it's probably already set and if you are anything like me, it's not changing anytime soon. Besides, film is art not science and art is about emotion. No movie has meant as much to me as The Godfather, let me tell you why. I think I got hooked on movies because I am an obsessive person. If I read a good book I must read ALL of the authors work--two days into The Road, I had ordered McCarthy's other nine books. Everybody loves movies. I bet one in three adults hasn't touched a book in over a year but most of us make our pilgrimage to the local multiplex at least once every month or two and there are a handful of movies--whether they be Citizen Kane and 400 blows or Die Hard and The Rock--that we'll watch whenever they're on TV. At eleven or twelve, I certainly had my list of favorites but most of them were simply entertaining. I've since learned to appreciate Raiders of the Lost Ark as a piece of film making and ET as a genuinely brilliant work of art (its one of those movies you loved as a kid but love even more as an adult) but the Godfather was really the first movie that blew me a way. I may not have been able to tell you why but even back then i could tell, this was something special, this was a work of art. This film, along with its sequel (I like to think of them as one movie, mainly so I don't have to pick a favorite) Have topped my list of all time favorites for as long as I care to remember. Often I've wondered if its simply because of how strong my initial reaction was after that first viewing but every time I re watch it, from the beginning or starting in the middle, I'm reassured that it truly is the greatest film of all time. 'I believe in America,' still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, right down to the final scene when they close the door. The baptism is one of the greatest scenes in cinema, or is it the one at the toll booth, or at the wedding, or in the restaurant. There are too many. It is a film that doesn't just work at every level, it works perfectly at every level. If you have not seen this film you cannot say you love movies. American cinema may not have began here but every film since has been made in its shadow. It is the greatest film of all time and will never be topped, Period."
9,Outstanding. Masterpiece.,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly weaves a tale of power, family, and loyalty. Marlon Brando's portrayal is captivating, exuding authority and complexity. The film's slow-burning tension draws you into the morally intricate world of the Mafia. It's impeccable storytelling and iconic scenes, like the horse head in the bed, have left an indelible mark on pop culture. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is flawless, and the ensemble cast delivers unforgettable performances. With its compelling characters and exploration of the consequences of one's choices, The Godfather remains a timeless classic that deserves every bit of its acclaim."
10,Spectacular,Such an iconic piece of art .It's like classic Italian mob documentary narrated by the people within the story. Totally understood the enormous pressure during the production of this film as it's realism nature eventually changed how movies are made.
10,The best story I heard,"Now as I think, what to write about 'The Godfather' a thousand brilliant perspectives flash in my mind. Should I marvel at the mesmerizing story that surrounds you ever so sweetly or should I wonder about strong undertones which reveal themselves like shooting starts. Should I admire the vivid visualization of the dream or should I talk about the truth that emerges from it. Godfather might be a great movie to others but to me it is a journey through human mind, candid and knowing. The motives of a man and the eternal conflict with direction. All that is said about 'good', reveals itself in the story of this bad man. I am a fan of Vito Carlione, he is wise, he is respectful, he is a true capitalist. He is not bad himself but does not mind employing bad means. After all, some body has got to do the exploration. I can't say how thankful I am to people who made this movie for not spoiling my imagination. A truth well told is the biggest achievement."
9,Godfather,"Godfather script portrays the duality of man: good vs evil, law abiding vs crime, loyalty vs betrayal, logic vs emotions, etc. It also warns of the long term consequences of our actions despite our short term intents and factors driving us to a certain path, which in the protagonist life, is crime."
10,Love this movie!,I love this movie! Sense of family and brotherhood given in this movie!
10,Absolute classic.,"Absolute classic. To sum it up in a few words: it is simply the best film ever made. And my intention is not to repeat jargon: the film really is perfect in all aspects. Magnificent performances (seriously, absolutely EVERYONE acts with excellence, especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino), impeccable script, wonderful direction, exquisite photography, unforgettable soundtrack, excellent production and costume design work, very well edited, and so on. Go. The film is approximately 3 hours long and is well used (in other words, there is no hassle as it is a long film: every minute is well used to tell the story). It is a must-see film for all those who like cinema. Despite being relatively old (1972), it is a film that has aged extremely well, including in terms of the actors' performance."
10,Simply the best...,"I can't say enough about this film. It is simply the best example of what can be achieved through the art of cinema. It's visually stunning, literate and totally engrossing. It gave us the finest Pacino performance of his career, no small feat. And gave us Brando unlike I've ever seen him before. You can't take your eyes off him. His performance is stunning. Every other role is also perfectly cast. Look for James Caan to ignite the screen. I watch this film at least once a year so I can remember what a first rate film is supposed to be like."
9,Love this movie!,"Love this movie! A true classic, never gets old. It was even better seeing it on the big Screen!"
10,G.O.A.T. Movie,"The Godfather is often hailed as the greatest movie of all time, and for good reason. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this 1972 classic is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and cinematic technique.

The film follows the powerful Corleone family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in an iconic performance. The story delves into the intricacies of family loyalty, power struggles, and the moral complexities of the mafia world. Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, is a compelling transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader.

What sets The Godfather apart is its meticulous attention to detail and its ability to humanize its characters, making them relatable despite their criminal undertakings. The cinematography, with its use of shadows and light, creates an atmosphere that is both intimate and grand. The score by Nino Rota is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly complementing the film's tone.

The dialogue is sharp and memorable, with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" becoming part of popular culture. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold naturally and giving the audience time to connect with the characters.

In essence, The Godfather is not just a gangster film; it's a profound exploration of power, family, and the American Dream. Its influence on cinema is undeniable, and it continues to be a benchmark for filmmakers and a favorite among audiences.."
10,the best movie,This its the movie that anyone ho love the mafia have to watch first than any other.
9,"A terrifically entertaining movie, but deeply phony and morally dishonest.","You get a lot to enjoy in The Godfather, although I suspect that anyone who has not read the book before seeing the movie might occasionally lose track of the plot.

But the movie is morally crooked, because the Corleone Family are never shown doing anything criminal, other than killing off rival criminals in justifiable self-defense. Don Vito Corleone is a wise, benevolent patriarch to the Italian American community of New York, and gets into trouble with rival gangsters only because he refuses to take part in selling heroin. Unless you have been told that he is a criminal, you'd never know. You certainly never see the Corleones cheating or hurting honest citizens. That's what I mean when I say that the movie is crooked.

Compare the Corleones to TV's Sopranos. Tony Soprano is overtly criminal-a brutal, thieving, murdering, adulterous extortionist who pretends to adhere to a Mafia code, which he breaks whenever it suits him to break it. This is why The Sopranos is artistically superior to The Godfather. The creators of the Sopranos have actually dared to make Tony Soprano and his fellow criminals hateful, which is just what you would expect real criminals to be. Don Corleone, on the other hand, resembles a real human being about as much as Tarzan of the Apes.

So, great as The Godfather is as an entertainment, it fails as art."
9,Great!,"I'm a bit different than most 14 year old guys that love 2 fast 2 furious. My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption and I love watching classics. Anyway, after numerous people telling me that they would literally kick my ass unless i saw this movien and the rest, I decided to do it. I've yet to watch Part II & III. Anyway, I really liked this movie. The acting was superb by all, and there's no need to beat a dead horse (pun intended:P) by saying that Pacino and Brando are unbelievable. Although I didn't LOVE it as incredibly much as some people, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't wait to see the next two parts.

8/10"
10,Nothing To say.,This is most movie spots to be watched Best movie ever
10,Best Crime Movie,It's The Godfather ffs. From all the crime movies this one is the best imo.And it surely deserves 10.Everything is amazing from story to characters.
10,joining the underworld,"The Godfather is a great film made with gusto. Most of the participants are at their career best. Nina Rota's magnificent score and Francis Ford Coppola's direction tie things together very well.

Al Pacino is the greatest performer of a top-shelf cast. The decision to cast him as Michael is a stroke of cinematic genius. (Supposedly, Marlon Brando threatened to quit if Pacino wasn't cast, and this tipped the scales in Pacino's favor.)

Another diminutive actor playing Michael might have emulated James Cagney a bit, with bounce and swagger in his step. Pacino never seems worried about his physical stature; instead, his Michael is very articulate. Pacino and Brando are putting on a Method acting show; and their chemistry together is sublime.

The Godfather foreshadows Michael's destiny exquisitely. For example, consider the hospital sequence. Michael enters a room looking for the detectives protecting his father and we hear the musical soundtrack repeating the number ""two."" Michael opens the hospital door to his father's room--and it is clearly marked with the number two. The association of the number two with Vito when Michael is present foreshadows the rise of Michael in the family business. (That is, Michael is #1.) In addition, the actor playing Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei) has a strong resemblance to Pacino. When Michael throws Enzo's carnations away (on the steps outside the hospital) this is another clue that Michael is destined to chuck away the lover boy side of him and rise in the underworld.

Marlon Brando's performance is a lightning rod for criticism, praise and satire. It is difficult to imagine any other actor of his time portraying Don Vito with all the knowing looks and gestures that Brando makes. It is another brave portrayal from Brando.

The conflict between brothers Sonny (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is well explored. Sonny is all testosterone and action while Tom Hagen is cautious and inexperienced in underworld affairs. Since Hagen is adopted, he is both an insider and an outsider. The audience needs him to help understand the Sicilian logic at play.

Having seen The Godfather dozens of times, it is fun pointing out the implausibility with the story. For example, it seems very hard to believe that a brother-in-law, already having been savagely smacked around in public for hitting his wife, would beat her again knowing that his wife's hot-headed brother would chase after him without his bodyguards. How much could Carlo have been paid to willingly absorb the risk that his brother-in-law exercises usual caution?

Another implausible is that Barzini is doing something in public the day of the Baptism. Forgetting that Baptisms usually occur on a Sunday, what happens to Michael if Barzini is staying at home that day?

The Godfather has us rooting for Michael even as he descends into evil. The transformation that Michael makes is shared by the viewer; we are also joining a criminal conspiracy. It is a uniquely memorable and pleasurable ride."
10,Simply magnificent,"This is a brilliant film. This has absolutely no flaw. The story is narrated perfectly and the thrill grows with each scene. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have played their roles so perfectly that you end up mesmerized by their act. A Textbook for all actors, writers and directors."
10,Great Movie,One of the greatest films that I have watched in my life
10,Flawless,We cant be friends if you havent watched this masterpiece. Call me after youre done.
10,A movie without anything that needs to be changed,"The Godfather: A movie without anything that needs to be changed. Indeed, when one sees the godfather, one doesn't have anything to criticize it. Their script is perfect, in fact, for me is one of the best screenplay ever written; the performances and the direction are also perfect: The performances are really wonderful, especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, accompanied with a marvelous cast; and the direction is amazing. Equally, the soundtrack, the decorations, the wardrobe and all that conforms the movie, is perfect; anything is in its place. The master sum in all their components, make The godfather an immortal and unforgettable movie. A master piece. An entire cinematographic lesson."
10,wanderful,The movie is wery good i watchet it a few time and its one of my favorit movies ever the movie it's just wel made.
10,The Godfather of all the movies from the last 33 years!!!,"Very well executed, ""The Godfather"" is one of the best films of the last three decades. It is directed by a great director: Francis Ford Coppola, and the cast is so great: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton (in her first starring role).

Winner of 3 Oscars and 5 Golden Globes, ""The Godfather"" is one of the best gangster flicks ever made. You do not remember the facts, but this film is a classic tale of a Mafia family: the Corleones. This is a true classic of the 1970s, you don't be fooled.

I also recommend: ""The Godfather, Part II"" and ""The Godfather, Part III"". Rent the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy in your local videostore."
10,Very good,The Godfather is a powerful and iconic film that captures the complexities of family loyalty power and crime It tells the story of the Corleone family a powerful mafia dynasty in post World War II New York City At the center of the story is Vito Corleone the aging patriarch played by Marlon Brando and his youngest son Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino The film explores themes of loyalty revenge and the consequences of choosing a life of crime Michael's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless mafia boss is gripping and tragic The film is filled with unforgettable performances especially from Brando and Pacino the direction by Francis Ford Coppola is masterful and the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful The Godfather remains a timeless classic and one of the greatest films ever made.
10,The Greatest Ever!,"The depth of story and the accuracy of the life through the ages is just outstanding. Beaten only by the number of breathless performances on screen. I must of watched this movie almost a hundred times and it's brilliance is the reason that the Trilogy is by far THE best Trilogy ever. This is 'The Godfather' of gangster movies and indeed movies in general. Every award won was completely deserved. Francis Ford Coppola absolutely nailed it with this stunning movie. The choice of cast too was 100% perfect. And of course the plot. Written, Directed and Produced to absolute perfection. Pure genius ."
10,"The best, unmatched realism and a wonderful work of art and entertainment","this is probably the best film in the history of cinema, if not the best, then at least in the top 5. a film can be good for one of many reasons; good acting, good direction, writing, etc., good entertainment (simply fun to watch) or a brilliant artistic piece of work. the godfather contains all of these elements. the cast alone is a given that the acting will be brilliant, and as the cast suggests, it is. Brando reinvented himself, Pacino's screen legend was born and Duval and Caan are simply wonderful. the women are notable as well, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton. many others shine in smaller roles.

the writing is clever and authentic (having the original author, Mario Puzo co-write the script added the realism), while Coppola added what he needed for it to be a successful movie. the direction is crisp and faced paced when it needs to be, the film feels real, most viewers can sympathize with these criminals/murderers as well as easily being able to engulf themselves into their world.

the movie is entertaining and original. it is artistic, a great parable about family life and values, and containing an unexpected dose of morality, which serves as splendid irony. overall, this is probably the most well rounded movie of all time containing elements of everything one wishes a movie to contain. 10 out of 10, hands down."
10,Insane Performance,"When reviewing a classic masterpiece like the Godfather, it is hard to believe that there is still something left to say. Well, to me , movies are all about performances and how a viewer can relate to a character. I am fascinated with actors. Marlon Brando has showed us that in order to be believable one has to search deep down his soul even look for a crazy version of himself in order to deliver a believable character. Directors should give the freedom to the actor to deliver a character that has to come somewhere from within the actor himself. Any judge of talent in an audition will tell you that a performer has to lay down his emotions on the floor and be true to himself so that the audience can feel his truth and relate to it. Marlon Brando has just showed us what acting is all about. The Godfather is now , thanks to Marlon, a man who knows that by lifting a finger his will shall be executed and the ""scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day""...Marlon Brando doesn't need to convince us how powerful the Godfather is, we are already convinced , he won us in just a few lines. Now we believe he is trying to bring Bonasera back to the ""family"" under his power and to the business of trading ""services"". The magic of the Godfather is right here and there."
8,nice,"Not really bad, i really enjoy to watch this movie. But its really old and classic."
10,good movie,Loved it. The acting is great and the shots look amazing. Can watch is over and over again Loved it. The acting is great and the shots look amazing. Can watch is over and over again.
10,The best film. Fire,"I wanted to master The Godfather trilogy by Francis Ford Coppola for a long time, so when the chance came, I decided to take it. The first in a row, of course, is the first film released in 1972. At the moment, he is 48 years old - let's see how he looks almost half a century after his release.

Don Corleone's youngest son Michael returns to his home after World War II to wallow in the war of mafia clans. But first he introduces his father Vito Corleone to his chosen one Kay at the wedding of Connie's sister.

On Christmas Eve, drug lord Sollozzo asks Vito Corleone to invest in his drug business and provide protection through political connections. Vito refuses the offer, after which the five families start an open war.

By itself, the ""Godfather"" is not so much a character in the story as an honorable position that is reserved for a young and ambitious son Michael, who understands the responsibility of this position, but at first categorically refuses to get involved."
9,Epic and historical,This film captures the realness of the times it was set in. The acting is fantastic and the scenery general. The characters in the production have to each tap into sides that is not natural to them and made the film what it was by taking on the characters to the point where it seems like they lived through them.
10,"an american classic, best mafia film ever made.","The Godfather is one of the greatest american movies ever created. It is a classic. Why? well if for no other reason The Godfather should be considered a classic form being the first movie to have the entire audince routing for the bad guys. It made it ok to be a criminal so long as you had honor. On side note the transformation of Micheal from war hero and all around good guy to the Mob Don is great, the way he can go from being so normal to being the Don that strikes fear into the viewers is amazing."
10,Excellence!,"Absolute cinematic masterpiece!

From the sharp lighting to the heavily stylized acting. This is pure genius."
10,Classic that lives on,When everything comes together! And lasts you get this.
10,Take the gun leave the cannoli,"The story, writing, pacing, dialogue, acting, and cinematography are perfect. A movie that I could watch over and over. Vito might very well be the most iconic character in cinema history. Michael's arc is incredible. Tom Hagen and Peter Clemenza are two of my favorite side characters in cinema. This movie has the greatest cast that I have ever seen. The music is iconic. Every single conversation is memorable in some way. I love the use of shadows in this movie. Don't listen to the people that call this movie boring. It's easily one of the most thrilling movies of all time. My second favorite movie currently. Must watch."
10,This is the best until the best is done.,"One of the best quality trilogies ever, maybe the best. When I first watched this movie, I questioned why I watched it so late. The acting is great, the production is great. In short, everything is great. Great movie."
8,Beautifully Crafted Film,"It is an extraordinary film that showcases the power of storytelling and the art of filmmaking. With its mesmerizing performances, breathtaking visuals, and profound narrative, it leaves a lasting impression on the audience. This cinematic masterpiece challenges viewers to embark on their own journey of self-discovery, unraveling the enigmas within themselves. "" The film encourages the audience to delve into their own enigmatic depths, questioning their choices, desires, and the true nature of their existence. However, for those who appreciate thought-provoking cinema that delves into the human psyche, this film is a true gem."
9,Must-see movie,"Either you like it or you don't get attracted. There is no way between the two interests.

Personal opinion: must-see film which presents the world of mafia(s) quite realistic.

Besides that, actors' performances are more than awesome."
10,Greatest movie of all times,"There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all."
10,Godfather what to say.,"Godfather is some of the best movies ever made,I havent to say any bad about this title movie like that cannon made again this is one in milion masterpice."
10,Best performance ever by Marlon Brando,It's among the best films i have ever seen and watch again and again. Especially for Marlon Brando. Its a masterpiece.
9,"this a movie which every Actor should watch. performance, acting, direction, cinematography.","This a movie which every Actor should watch. Performance, acting, direction, cinematography. Everyone please watch this movie at least once, theatre, drama, action.. everything is there. Bad as performance, creator and wonderfully made this movie at that time when movie is making. The family story line is awesome, and the acting of the protagonist was excellently perform by the actor, specially the child of the father, but this film is not about father and son or father and daughter but this is purely about actors life, kindly watch this movie and the underworld reality, the film set and cinematography and every actor performs wonderfully."
10,Hold up really well even to this day. A classic.,"I've never seen The Godfather from the beginning to the end until today. I was really impressed with how well it holds up, it is really well made and I enjoyed it a lot. This movie is timeless. I really liked seeing a young Al Pacino and Diane Keaton. It was like going back in time."
10,One of the best series!,I would love to see a remake of this series sometime in the future.
10,Coppola's Masterpiece,"When a movie isn't called one of the greatest of all time, then high expectations are bound to come. Sadly, this means some people will be disappointed. I've felt the same way about Dr. Strangelove and Back to the Future. So every movie has naysayers, just how it is. But I am always astoundes when I hear someone does not like The Godfather. It really is the closet thing to a perfect film that I have ever seen. From the story, the production, direction, and of course, the acting. Brando puts on his greatest performance. Pachino, Duvall, Keaton and Caan also put on extraordinary performances. The movie is long but never boring. It always manages to keep you interested even in the more slow parts. That is good filmmaking.

The music is haunting and beautiful and fits the film like a glove. The story never glorifies the lifestyle. It takes great care to show the characters best and worst sides of themselves. They are all fully realized and incredibly well developed. It shows the saga of a crime families rise, fall and rise again, in the most epic fashion.

Im still pretty young, in my early 20s, and I'm hoping to be a movie critic someday. I don't think I could have picked a better movie to review.

Francis Ford Coppola has made at least three of the greatest movies ever made. This movie, it's sequel, and Apocolypse Now. Some say Seven Samurai, some might say Casablanca, others Citizen Kane, but in my mind, and many others minds, This is the greatest movie ever made."
10,Very Good Offer for me,This is a great offer and should be taken advantage of immediately.
10,Amazing movie that I have ever seen,Baba is the iconic movie for me. I can watch every day . It's really amazing movie. When I watched at firstly I was child. And impressed me soo much. Also music is so Iconic. Most people still use this melody for ringtone :) When I started to the acting courses I learned something about Marlon Brando. He was reading his dialoges in front of his partners. They was sticks his dialoges to partners on. And he was reading from there. Althought read them he is really succsessfull actor. Also when I searched his old photos he was soo handsome. I am not think his succsess not suprise he is really amazing actor.
10,Simply amazing,"No movie will ever come close to Godfather 1 and 2. They are the pinnacle of Mafia/crime movies. New movies in the genre does its best to imitate what Godfather did, just look at ""the irishman""...

Truely a must watch for any movie lover, and a real banger for anyone who enjoys a rich story.

However, it is a slow-burner, so maybe not for the action-lovers out there."
9,Classic,"This was a classical movie that will left you moved even after watched decades after its making. This is centered on the life of a mafia and his strike with few conflicting families. The reluctant son of the mafia is forced to join the the group due to unprecedented circumstances. Direction, screenplay and acting are in sync."
9,One of the best movie ever!,"In my opinion ""The Godfather"" is widely one of the greatest films of all time and has had a significant impact on me. Winning three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Marlon Brando, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. The film has since spawned two sequels, ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""The Godfather Part III,"" but they aren't as good as the first part.

The film explores the loyalty, family, power, and corruption, and is known for its iconic scenes and memorable quotes, including ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""The Godfather"" is a real classic."
9,Easy re-watch,Each decade of my own life brings out more nuances of understanding the life of this fictionalized mobster classic. Love the depths of characters and the skilled role play.
9,Family and crime,"This movie can be recognized by two things, family and illegal activities And one of the most important points that made this movie popular (at least in my eyes) was that these two things were shown well together.

Maybe another reason was that, like a business, everything was on time, clean, stylish and important, and the main family was not at all like ordinary criminals.

This movie started with happy and beautiful scenes, but as we went further, it became darker and at the same time exciting.

The great actors who played in this film became one of the reasons for the greatness of this film. If they were ordinary actors, the film would not shine at all."
10,"Apart From Citizen Kane, This Is The Greatest Movie Of All Time.","""Saying that you like film but you don't like The Godfather is like saying you like to drink but you don't like water! They are the be all, end all, best films of all time that will never be topped."" - Film critic Richard Roeper.

Roeper, who worked with Roger Ebert on his show for 6 years, is absolutely right. You've probably heard again and again how either this is the greatest movie ever made, or that only Citizen Kane tops it. I'm in the latter category.

To be honest, I watched it for the 4th time recently, and that's when it made my Top 10. My first time was when I was 18- I'm 24 now. It was the first movie I saw as an adult.

I thought it was good, don't get me wrong, but I didn't fully understand why it was so highly regarded. A few months pass, and I watch it on TV. I liked it more. When I was 19, I saw it again on DVD, and I liked it even more.

5 years have now passed, and I finally appreciated it the way I, a film buff, should have. And there it went, in the Top 10 best movies I have ever seen.

The Godfather is set in Post-WWII New York, and focuses on the Corleone family. They're in The Mafia (a word never spoken in the film, the real Mafia requested this), and if someone betrays the family, they are hunted down and murdered.

The Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), is getting old and his health is deteriorating, and he asks his godson Michael (Al Pacino) to take over the family business. Michael is reluctant, but he eventually agrees to uphold his family's honor.

The Godfather is so iconic that any praise I'd give it is nearly pointless. I can add very little to what others already have. Among the most iconic is the famous scenes and lines.

From the opening request of murder to avenge for the murder of a daughter, to the subsequent wedding scene, from the horse head in bed (which was real, by the way) to the baptism scene, so many segments have been ingrained into our modern culture.

The same goes for many lines. Even those who have never seen The Godfather are sure to be aware of lines like: ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"", ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"", and of course: ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.""

The movie is filled with many well-known actors who have gone on to do great work. Apart from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, other famous actors include James Caan (Misery, Elf), Diane Keaton (Father of the Bride-1991, Something's Gotta Give), Robert Duvall (The Apostle, Secondhand Lions), and Talia Shire (The Rocky films), to name a few. Even here, in their younger selfs, they display excellent talent.

The Godfather is flawlessly made, from beautiful camera work to the costumes, to the plot. There are also some visual things that stand out. For example, whenever oranges appear, that hints that someone is going, or about, to die.

I should note that Marlon Brando did insist on wearing a mouthpiece (this is why his jaw is bigger), and this mumbles his speech. That is the closest I can come to faulting The Godfather, an otherwise exquisite masterpiece. And that's extremely minor.

The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest contributions to cinema. Regardless of if you are a film buff or a casual viewer, it is a must see. You may be like me and need to grow and see it more than once but trust me when I say that it is the grand film that it is regarded as."
10,It doesn`t get any better than this,"This film will forever stand as the truly greatest of it`s time or of all time.You will not find a better movie anywhere and if you don`t think this film is great,well you got a serious problem. I thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for this film and I hope we will see Coppola back in action soon. The acting as well is brilliant and Marlon Brando as the godfather,he is just amazing.This film only recieved three Oscars and it should have got more. This is a film about the mob or the ""cosa nostra"" but it is also a film about family and friendship.It`s a very touching film and a very beautiful film. This is the ultimate film and I love it. So it doesn`t get any better than this and to all of you out there who haven`t seen it,you don`t know what you`re missing. This is the BEST!!!!"
10,Powerful advice that will last forever!,"This move touches on so many aspects of life from love, to death, to money to power. It really teaches you the value of all that i listed. Forever classic in my collections!"
10,Amazing movie!,"The best film of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is the best gangster drama."
9,excellent,"The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990. On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his fear, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital, but is accosted by corrupt police captain McCluskey, who breaks his jaw; Sonny retaliates by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey that his brother approves over Hagen's objections: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael lures the pair to a restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Vito, saddened to learn that, despite his hopes, Michael has become involved in the family business, decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home and over a year later marries Kay. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife to make the business legitimate within five years. He allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises even as he plans to move family operations to Nevada and delegates New York business to members who stay behind. Hagen, upset when Michael replaces him with Vito, is mollified by the older man's reassurance about their long- range plans for him. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signally his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Brazen, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."
9,This movie is classics,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** This series,does not have 尷尬 silence.

If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the 最重要的 thing you can do before watching is to forget all of the greatest film . The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time."

10,To Watch Again and Again...,I once lived in a house with a gym and the others rented all the Godfather videos and played them back to back continuously forom Friday to Monday allowing anyone to come in and watch them. The room was full all weekend and I didn't go out for four days... and you know what? I'd do it again like a shot! I love the whole Godfather series. Full marks.
10,Absolutely Excellent and Totally Fantabulous !,"We Totally Concur with what a Similar Film Critic (The Legendary Rybecca Quinn of TCW) competently wrote elsewhere (as follows) :

"" This Film (i.e The GodFather) is so (damn) good because it is a masterpiece of a film that is held together firmly through a strong cast, world-changing cinematography, and the music that intensifies the strong theme presented in the film.

This film is considered to be the best of Francis Ford Coppola's work, as well as many members of the cast.

The Godfather has become such an iconic film that nearly everyone knows at least one line or another from the film.""

What more can we possibly add to that (except) that :

* It is Absolutely Excellent and Totally Fantabulous !

* It is Totally Excellent and Absolutely Fantabulous !

9,Outstanding,"Marlon Brando Became Don Vito, such a believable performance."
10,Classic of the classics,"The movie is powerful, strong, good casting, good talkings, it's hard to find a defect here. You can watch and re-watch and does not get boring. There's nothing else to say than: go and watch if you haven't watched yet."
10,"""...wherever he goes, death follows..."" F.F. Coppola on Michael Corleone","The Great Contribution to Cinema and American History itself... because, let's face it: If you're not part of any religious or ethnic minority in the good-ol' US-of-A (and we all came from another country; American Indians being the only true Natives), then the Godfather franchise means nothing to you except slickly-packed violence.

A masterpiece of American filmmaking; less derivative and more seminal than other films previous and since.

Novelist-screenwriter Mario Puzo and screenwriter/director Francis Ford Coppola care for the characters they wrought here, and the two sequels. Maybe not all of their individual efforts work for us, but they are still products of meticulous filmmaking, and each Godfather film deserves a serious examination in this esthetic sense.

Godfather lays down the groundwork, introducing us to Don Corleone and his sons, each of which have their own tragic destinies. The Don's youngest son, Michael, prooves to be the wisest and most formidable, and takes over the Family Seat.

Godfather Part II gives us the Don's family history in Sicily, and Michael's transformation into a paranoid 'monster.'

Godfather Part III examines Michael's pain, panic and remorse, for having gone this far (1979) and not having become ""legitimate.""

Actors Al Pacino and Talia Shire each grew and became better, thespian-wise, through these three aforementioned Godfather installments, and deserve recognition for their efforts."

9,GODFATHER,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The film features an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss."
8,Masterpiece,This film is amazing I've learned a lot just by watching it.
10,"By far the best Mafia movie ever made, actually the best movie ever made.","I think this movie is perfect, it's the best movie ever made in history. It's by far a must see movie if your into the mafia and i know iam. This movie out plays every other mafia movie out there, there is no mafia movie to beat it and at that no movie period to beat it. Trust me and see this movie."
10,The best movie ever made,"There's nothing bad you can say about this movie, it's just that good. From the screenplay to the performances it is just perfect. There will never be another movie like this."
10,Film that blow your mind.,"In the beginning of the film the characters reveal the life they lives.This is not the most interesting part of the film but we need it to see the big picture. After that the amazing story is reveal herself.

When yo're a son of a big mafia boss you don't want to be like your father but when he is kill'd by ""the other mafia family"" the story is turn 180 for Michael. Hi respond to them by revenge like it or not this is the beginning of the war for the family's. If you live like this and you are surround by Italians Mafia and very bad gays that want to kill you or other member of your family you will protect them at any cost. Even if you don't want to kill anybody but it is necessary. Many people will say this is not the way to resolve a problems but if you have big money and many guns, why not?

The Film has old fashion stile and every time i watch the film i want to be there. For some reasons the film is not like any other films, just like you read a new book and you want to read it all at once to the last page. You don't want to stop for any second and to watch it to the end.

Yes the film is long 3 hours but how many films with that duration you don't sleep after the second hour. This is the film that after 3 hours you will wanted to watched't again to be sure that you don't mist anything. Even the film is back at 1972, Coppola just set the work very brilliant for decades ahead."
10,A Timeless Masterpiece!,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is not just a film; it is an experience. The moment the film begins, you're drawn into a world so rich, so complex, and so beautifully crafted that it's impossible to look away. The story of the Corleone family, their rise to power, and the loyalty, betrayal, and sacrifice that come with it, is told with such depth and precision that it feels as if you're witnessing history unfold. Every element of this film-its acting, direction, writing, and music-works in perfect harmony to create a cinematic masterpiece.

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary. He doesn't just play the character; he becomes him. With every deliberate movement, every whisper of dialogue, Brando paints a picture of a man who is both feared and respected, whose kindness and ruthlessness coexist in a delicate balance. The now-iconic ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" line? It's a moment that will send chills down your spine every single time you hear it, because Brando delivers it with such authority and depth. His performance is a perfect blend of subtlety and power, elevating the film to new heights.

And then there's Al Pacino, who, in the role of Michael Corleone, goes through a transformation that is nothing short of extraordinary. When we first meet Michael, he is an outsider to the family business, a man of honor who wants to distance himself from the violence and corruption that surround him. But as the story unfolds, we watch Michael's descent into the dark world of organized crime, and Pacino's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing. His ability to convey Michael's internal conflict, his struggle between loyalty to his family and his desire for a different life, is haunting and unforgettable. By the film's conclusion, Pacino has crafted one of the most compelling character arcs in film history.

The screenplay, written by Mario Puzo and Coppola, is pure genius. It doesn't rush to tell its story; it allows the audience to immerse themselves in the lives of these complex characters. The power struggles, family dynamics, and personal tragedies unfold slowly and methodically, creating a tension that never lets up. The Godfather isn't just a story about crime; it's a poignant commentary on power, loyalty, and the human condition. The family's devotion to each other is both touching and tragic, and as the film progresses, we realize that the Corleones are a family bound by blood, but also by the choices they've made and the lives they've taken.

Coppola's direction is nothing short of masterful. He understands the nuances of the script and brings it to life with incredible attention to detail. Every frame feels purposeful, every scene meticulously composed. The lighting, especially, is a crucial part of the film's atmosphere. The use of shadows creates a sense of mystery, danger, and moral ambiguity. And the pacing? Perfect. The film is long, but it never drags. You're never bored because there's always something captivating happening on screen, whether it's a tense conversation, a violent confrontation, or a quiet moment of reflection.

The music by Nino Rota is the perfect complement to the film's tone. The hauntingly beautiful score sticks with you long after the film ends, evoking feelings of nostalgia, melancholy, and, at times, dread. The music doesn't just accompany the story-it becomes a part of it, deepening the emotional impact of every scene.

In the end, The Godfather is more than just a film. It's an exploration of family, power, loyalty, and the choices that define us. It is a story that resonates on a universal level, one that continues to be relevant and impactful even decades after its release. Every time I watch it, I discover something new, something I missed before, and that's what makes it so special. The Godfather is not just a classic; it's a timeless work of art that will remain at the top of the cinematic world for generations to come."
10,A Must Watch!,"Though it's a movie of a gangster family's life. But it taught so many humanity and how to treat people good and bad. At first, I don't really want to watch this movie. Untill my girlfriend recommend it to me. I watch the first chapter and soon I addicted to the next Chapter. This is just kind of best movie. Love Italian so much."
10,my 1st review on IMDb,"One of the best movies i have ever watched. it is a mix of pest performers, a great technical team and a clear vision of a film maker. which i think is missing in the world of green screens and a senseless screen plays of today. i often see people saying that this film is all about underground and mafia but i personally feel it is not only about Mafia done and power play but it is all about human emotions and how it will weaken or give energy to a human to grow or may be fall off."
10,Must Watch!,"This is one of the best movies made till date. At the beginning it may seem boring and long but if you continue the plot, you will love it. Everything is good in it. This is one of the movies everyone must watch before they die."
10,The Best Mafia Movie EVER,"I don't want to say anithing. This is one of the 100 best films ever, and the best mafia movie ever. That's it."
10,"Overall, simply the best.","I can't imagine a more solid film. This is one movie I don't get tired of watching. Whether it is the acting, the story, or the dialogue, The Godfather delivers. Brando is the quintessential mafioso, and Pacino is convincing as the ""black sheep"" of the family who comes to realize his true calling when his family needs him most. His transformation is well told - it does not come as a surprise; it does not seem contrived. The supporting cast is solid as well. I couldn't recommend it more highly."
10,"A template for filming with the finest direction, cinematography and editing","The Godfather sets the standard for contemporary filming. {Francis Ford Coppala} (Finians Rainbow) inspires George Lukas, Steven Spielberg and becomes the today's Orsen Welles. Godfather had extreme controversy during production and release mostly from the Italian community. (wanting to be presented in a good light and shed the mafia mentality) Francis breaks new ground in establishing the money is no object in creativity. Of note, Godfather is the last produced to have been printed in true, three strip Technicolor, as the plant in Hollywood ceased the process. Shooting on location, cast of prominent names and of course the Godfather himself, Mr. Marlon Brando. Godfather, a film to be viewed again and again, play's itself. The influence to go on to create the part 2 and part 3 series."
10,Great,"This is great man, an new idol when first I have seen. Strong, Cool and Inteligent"
10,A timeless masterpiece based on the novel by Mario Puzo.,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, is considered one of the greatest masterpieces in cinematic history. Released in 1972, the film is a captivating portrayal of the Italian-American mafia, told through the story of the Corleone family.

Plot and Themes The story follows Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the youngest son of the powerful mafia boss Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Initially uninvolved in the family business, Michael gradually becomes entangled, eventually rising to lead the family. The film explores universal themes such as power, family, loyalty, and corruption, presenting a moral and human epic that transcends a mere tale of a criminal family.

Direction and Screenplay Coppola delivers masterful direction, characterized by a slow yet compelling narrative that builds tension and emotional depth. Every scene is meticulously crafted, from pacing to dialogue, turning even the most violent moments into artistic representations. The screenplay, written by Coppola and Puzo, strikes a perfect balance between narrative complexity and character development, creating a work that is both intimate and epic.

Performance of the Actors The performances are extraordinary. Marlon Brando delivers one of his most iconic roles as the patriarch Vito Corleone, infusing the character with a blend of authority and vulnerability. Al Pacino, as Michael, portrays a tragic and chilling transformation from an idealistic young man to a ruthless mafia leader. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, also significantly enhances the film's quality.

Score and Cinematography Nino Rota's score is an unforgettable element of the film, with its main theme evoking both melancholy and solemnity. Gordon Willis's cinematography, earning him the nickname ""The Prince of Darkness,"" skillfully uses chiaroscuro to emphasize the story's dark and dramatic tone.

Cultural Impact The Godfather has had a lasting impact on popular culture, influencing generations of filmmakers and redefining the gangster genre. The film also serves as a critical portrait of America, reflecting on the American Dream and its contradictions.

Conclusion With its combination of compelling storytelling, memorable performances, and technical mastery, The Godfather is more than just a mafia film-it is a work that explores the complexities of the human soul. It remains a cinematic experience that continues to captivate and inspire, solidifying its status as a timeless classic."
10,Perfection.,"""The Godfather"" exists within a vacuum: it is without precedent, and (not for the want of much effort), it is without imitation. To try and objectively review this Film, after its effect on my life, would be a poor joke. Frankly, I adore it. It is Romantic, absolutely. Beyond belief. Even Technically, it's a paradise. The colours drip, rich and heavy. The characters hold up a mirror to our psyche, and the dialogue has rightly cemented ""The Godfather"" as a movie which will always have a relevance. Ironically, this tale of counter-culture has become arguably the definitive Pop Culture statement. ""The Godfather"" IS the gap between Mainstream and Art. It is the scale to which every ""classic"" must compare itself, and inevitably fall short. Concise Coalescence: ""The Godfather"" is the greatest Movie ever made. But that's not why I LOVE it. Sure, I respect a whole bunch of Films. I can recognise a Film's influence, award it its dues, and move on. But I keep coming back to this, because I feel an affection for it. Every time I hear that sweeping Niño Rota score, I'm reminded: this changed my life! Days spent dreaming of my future as either a Mafioso or a Film-maker. To a degree, ""The Godfather's"" reputation does it a disservice; this isn't a Movie to admire, it's a Movie to FEEL. And I guarantee you, it's so powerful that only a truly emotionally dead person won't feel it.

And so I again ask myself: Why is it I love ""The Godfather""? I love ""The Godfather"" because it never becomes cute or cuddly. I've just waxed lyrical about it, but as I sit to watch it, it's still dark, it's intimidating. It never gives itself up to soppy nostalgia, and that's why it remains as shocking a statement now as it did more than a quarter of a century ago. Perfection."
10,The one film I would bring to a desert island,"A unparalleled statement in cinema on almost all fronts.

""The Godfather"" (1972) is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and co-written with and based on the novel by Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of The Godfather, alias Don Corleone, and originally born Vito Andolini, he is the leader of the Corleone mafia family. As an ageing patriarch, Don Corleone wants his youngest son Michael to take over the family affairs, but he seems uninterested. From then on, the film centres on the increasing tensions between the Corleone and its rival mafia families in the search for power, integrity and honour.

I first saw ""The Godfather"" when I was around 14 or 15 years old, and that was truly when I fell in love with films. As a young boy, I could not attribute it to anything specific, but as I grew older, I realised that its grandeur was to be attributed to the numerous levels that Francis Ford Coppola excels at making the perfect film. From the formidable screenplay, to the precise direction, beautiful integration of the awesomely impressive cast (will there ever again be so much acting talent in one film), the perfect score by Nino Rota, the masterful cinematography by Gordon Willis, and the flawless editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner.

To focus on perhaps the film's most impressive element, Brando. His pure artful talent shines through in an ever-immersive performance, where he inspired all of his juniors, including Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. His performance in ""The Godfather"" perfectly exemplifies, why they and so many others of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Martin Sheen, the list goes on) hail Marlon Brando as the greatest in the history of the acting craft. He exemplifies how he was capable at portraying all human emotions with such depth and range, and he contributes to making this perfect film shining even more.

The very definition of a seminal work and a masterpiece in cinema!"
10,Best movie,BestbBest film i have seen. Best actinacting best direction bestbbest story
10,A masterpiece in every sense of the word,"In my opinion this is undoubtably one of the best and one my favourite films ever made. What is surprising as anything is that two years it was followed by Part II which is just as good (and then 20 years later and money-grabbing, dull and unnecessary third film). The first time I watched this film, I thought it was very good but overly long. But the second time I watched it, it didn't seem overly long at all, but beautifully detailed and concise - despite being nearly three hours long. I didn't find myself become bored, because the remarkable thing about this film is that almost every line, ever scene adds to the story or unfolding the characters, and their interaction with each other. The acting is believable, the direction is superb, and cinematography excellent.

As well as all this, the film avoids cliches and over-dramatising deaths, but instead shows the Italian culture and strong importance of relations with your family. The differemt characters seem to perfectly gel. Micheal who changes from being relatively uninvolved ('a citizen') to heading the family, Sonny -overly volatile, Fredo - not clever enough (he's more involved in the 2nd film), and Tom - the level headed, sensible lawyer, who doesn't let his emotions run away with him like the others. My only (slight) criticism of the film, is that the Scilly scenes didn't run as smoothly as the rest of the film. Although it was interesting to see where family orginates from (again the 2nd film covers this more), Micheals falling in love and then his newly-weds' death seem a little unrealistic. Well in didn't make as well sense to me in a way.

In summary this is a brilliantly detailed and enjoyable film, if not as 'entertaining' as Armaggedon (supposedly) or other rubbish. I can see how this film wouldn't be for all tastes, but anyone interested in the more 'classic' style which people remember for years to come, as well as the storyline, this is a MUST see. Also note its a good idea to watch Godfather Part II shortly afterwards, while Part I is still fresh in the mind, as they link together brillantly. 10/10"
10,best o the best,This movie is Epic. i never tired no matter howmany i see this.
10,Do you like the godfather? (Jesus ok you don't),"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is by far the most loved and cherished Movie in cinema history, You just can't escape it, but that might be the problem.

Since everybody that has access to the internet have read that sentence or one like it (The Godfather is the best movie ever), It feels like everybody loves it because they're told to, Everybody says they love the godfather and that it's the best movie ever made, but are they just following the crowd?

When's the last time you heard someone say the godfather is one of their favorite movies ever? Probably not long ago, when's the last time you heard somebody actually tell you what's so good about it without repeating those same words (Acting, Influential, Classic)?

Of course there ARE people who actually explain everything that is great about it and deep dive into analyzing the subtle things it inhabits, but would they have done it if they haven't constantly heard that it's the greatest movie ever?

Ok, you can stop screaming at your screen, ""The Godfather Is Terrible! It's so overrated!"" and so on, you don't like it, or are you just following a trend?

Look at the ratings of the godfather on any reviewing site (IMDB, Letterboxd etc.) and you'll see that 5/10 stars as the most popular rating and then the numbers of all the other ratings quickly go down, until a random spike at the bottom (1/2 star/1 star), that's because it's become a trend to hate the godfather.

People have 2 reactions to hearing that the godfather is the best movie ever made: 1, I know, It's a masterpiece, so amazing, it's a classic. (And they just didn't watch it or didn't pay attention) or: 2, No it's not! It sucks! It's overrated! Worst movie ever! (And they probably didn't watch it either)

My point is, you can't find a single review of ""The Godfather"" which hasn't been HEAVILY influenced by the general stigma of this movie, it's either they followed all the others like zombies, or they think they're revolutionaries by saying they don't. Nobody thinks the Godfather is a 1 star/ half a star movie, they just don't.

This movie IS amazing, but nobody seems to actually think so."
10,Best movie I've ever watched,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi"

When you say ""Godfather"", it just feels like a totally solid and amazing production.

Al Pacino is a level-headed and well-behaved man who is my favorite actor of all times. I can't think of better than that. This is a movie that feels like you are just part of it and that feeling melts my heart. I think they way they apply makeup to Don Vito is just.. amazing! Fredo is a great addition as he was able to reflect a passive-careless family member of most of us have probably experienced somewhere and somehow."

10,they don't make them like this anymore,"Everything you want a film to be, this is it. Amazing character(s) development and story that keeps you interested. All the actors seemed to be born to play these characters, especially Brando and Pacino who are at their finest."
10,Cool,"Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families."
10,Great Movie,"Whenever i saw a list of the top 100 movies, ""The Godfather"" was always on top. I had no clue why. I heard it was really good so i felt i should see it. So one evening, after all my homework was done, i sat down on the couch in front of the TV and surfed through the channels and i land upon a memo saying, ""The Godfather: Next at 8 pm"" So i decide to just watch maybe an hour or so of it and then go to sleep. I stayed up the whole night watching it. The acting in the movie was excellent and the cinematography was great. The characters were so believable that whenever i see a picture/movie of any character in the movie, the first thing that pops into my brain is their character name. After watching the movie, i couldn't stop talking about it to all my friends. Now i understand why its always on top of top 100 lists."
10,The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time.,"I have seen it four times and have enjoyed it every single time. In fact if I could only watch three movies for the rest of my life, this would be it along with to Kill A Mockingbird and American Beauty.

There are many things that make this movie enjoyable so many things that I have to break it down.

The plot. There are few American movies that have a plot as deep and complex as the Godfather. Usually when I don't want to spend 6 dollars to see a movie I'll just go to a website and read a recap, but with this it is impossible. There are more twists and turns then a hamster maze. In fact the first time I watched this I had to pause every 20 minutes just to take in what I was seeing.

It delivers what it promises. With 90 percent of today's movies they promise something big and epic, only to fail to deliver. The Godfather sets up high expectations and meets them all and then some. It is impossible to say this movie is over rated, because there isn't a scale in the world that can rate a movie such as this.

The characters. Just as a captain is nothing without his crew a movie is nothing without its characters and this movie has some of the most memorable. I cannot possibly have a favorite because they are all incredible. Clearly when casting they chose the best and not the ones that looked good and had six packs.

The dialogue. Very few movies have realistic dialogue. They sound rehearsed and forced, but this movie is the exception. The actors were speaking as if this was real life and they were having a realistic conversation. If I didn't know this was a movie I would think that someone had recorded an actual person's life.

The action. I won't deny it, I love action and this movie does not fail. The fight scenes were epic and unpredictable. One moment a family could be sitting down to a nice dinner and the next minute machine gun fire could be going everywhere. My personal favorite was when Emilio Barzini was shot and rolled down the stairs.

This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. This is one of the few movies that can please everyone. It has action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, a deep plot, and a feeling of satisfaction after you see it. If you haven't seen this movie do so as soon as possible this is one film that you can't refuse."
10,Great movie,This movie really broke the ice on mafia movies loved ever second of it. Power house cast cant stop watching. I hope to one day play in a classic like this and I'm sure I will. So many moments i couldn't move just had to sit eyes clued to TV. Epic movie. I can watch it a million times and not get tired.
10,Different for That Time,For years I ignored this movie thinking it might be too overrated and couldn't sit through such a long film . The movie is bit slow paced but has some fast paced sequences . Michael Corloene and Tom are my favorite characters . The climax was just amazing . Every actor did an amazing job . Must watch
10,Tbe Godfather Movie,"*The Godfather* (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is widely acclaimed as one of cinema's greatest masterpieces. Its meticulous storytelling and rich character development elevate it beyond a typical crime drama. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino deliver iconic performances that explore themes of power, loyalty, and family within the context of organized crime. The film's atmospheric cinematography, coupled with a memorable score by Nino Rota, enhances its immersive experience. The intricate portrayal of moral ambiguity and familial obligations makes it a compelling study of character and consequence, solidifying its place as a landmark in film history."
9,La cosa nostra...,"For those who have not seen this movie. Just for you ...

It doesn't matter whether you are positive or negative towards representatives of such strata of society. This film will definitely change you and your views on the relationship between people in general. Relationships both within the family and in your environment. At least for me personally, he became the most important movie I have ever watched. If earlier the boundaries were good / bad enough blurred, now I can draw a clear line between these concepts.

Essentially ... And without retelling the plot.

A saga about the Corleone family, spanning several generations of characters. Before us open the doors to the ins and outs of the entire era of the reign of the mafia. Structure, methods, principles - everything is shown as well as possible.

Character, masculinity, honor, willpower, a keen and keen mind are the features of the main character (In this part of the trilogy, I mean Vito Carleone).

Marlon Brando, who played it excellently, in my opinion deserves separate praise. Remarkably accustomed to the role and secondary characters. Their characters are clearly traced. And this cannot be overlooked.

It doesn't matter whether you like thrillers, detectives or dramas, but if you are a fan of those films, after which there should be a trace in your memory and a sense of aftertaste that does not give you peace for a long time, then I definitely recommend it for viewing.

A cult film about an equally cult era ..."
10,Greatest movie of all time,Thi movie has been in my wishlist for forever. Finally watched it and i wasnt dissapointed. Can't believe they made this masterpiece in 1970s! Loved the character development of Michael and how he takes over his father's role - but more dagerous and shrewd.
10,What A Movie....!!!!,Maybe the greatest movie ever. The first one is more special i think cause of Brando. Every time i see it i enjoy it the same!
10,Masterfull,"Probably one of the best movies ever created. Acting, photography, soundtrack, everything is magnum opus material."
10,the best,The best movie of wholetime.marloon brandoon acting is insane
10,Masterpiece,"Very popular movie so probably not going to say anything new, but I will try to tell the main good things about this movie. So let's start with acting I guess and oh boy it is amazing. All the characters feel so real, dialogues are really deep and full of meaning. Plot also is very strong and interesting, you can watch this movie like over and over and not get tired of shown scenes, character dialogues. Movie always keeps you interested in what is going to happen, you don't want to miss a single detail because movie makes it just that much interesting. And last the music. Music choice in the movie is so good and fits scenes so well, I just can't express it, you just have to watch it, it stick in your head and fills it with something I can't express. Definitely give it a try."
10,Perfect,"Nice movie to watch, you guys have to watch this, its a great movie. you guys will really enjoyed this movie like me.. belive me, you need to watch this."
10,top 5 Favorite movie,"I watched this for the first time when I was very young loved it then & still love it. to waste time i'll talk about love i had a girlfriend resonantly that i thought i loved but actually i just needed somebody at the time she talked about so many things i didn't really care about, at her ugly day i thought she was really ugly & to me those are two signs that tell you when you you love or don't love someone because like in the movie here was love and hate & so on, I know this because the son liked the girl when she was at her ugliest & cared about what she talked about....... Godfather puts an orange peel in his mouth at the end."
10,"A film like no other, not even Part II comes close!","A film better then anything Hollywood has ever produced. The critics adore Citizen Kane (a good film, undoubtably) but it doesn't have the deep qualities of the Godfather, it is a one man show (which can be good, Taxi Driver, but still...) but in the Godfather the star, Brando, I feel is a supporting character. Excellent as he is in the role, he still doesn't match the pace and glory of the next generation of Mafia hoods he is tutoring as the role of Don Corleone. The true gem of the bunch is obviously Pacino who controls the screen with a performance that he has never bettered in the 28 years since, but don't forget the arrogant Sonny (James Caan), the in control Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and my personal favorite, the runt of the litter Fredo, expertly executed by the late John Cazale.

All in all a story of love, power and above all, family."
10,The best maffia film ever made,"This film is Francis Ford Copollas best work together with The Godfather Part II.It shows how mobsters ran and still run their families and that its origin truly is Sicilian.

Al Pacino's big breakthrough and it's justified.The actor performance by all actors is fabulous.Never in my life have I ever seen a maffia boss so real like Marlon Brando.That's probably why it was copied by many others.They're all fabulous but Marlon Brando is just so awesome he almost blows you away.

I haven't given a film a 10 but I did it with the Godfather because it's the best maffia film ever made , if not even the best film ever made...They've got my vote on that too..."
9,Classic,"Classic. Absolute classic.

I want to rewatch all The Godfather's now that I'm older.

But as an Italian, this is a damn good movie - along with its series counterparts."
10,What do you include?,"Reducing a fat, thick, best-selling novel to manageable screenplay terms has always been a major problem for any filmmaker blessed (or cursed) with the assignment. What do you include? What do you leave out? Perhaps even more important, how do you cast to anticipate the expectations of the millions who have already read the book?

They did it to the fullest!"
10,The portrait of the seventh art.,"What can I say about one of the most remarkable films of cinema history ?, certainly any list you seek, is the Rolling Stone or syndicated actors, ""Godfather"" will be in the top 3 at least, not is less, see and witness the best that cinema has to present an extremely slow movie, 3 hours, but at the same time it is fast and keep it captivates and holds the viewer deeply during the I80 minutes I80 this that are pure tension, drama, suspense and intrigue, with impeccable script by Francis Ford Coppola which is based on the book by Mario Puzo (which also has a stake in the script), Godfather is one of those cases where the film is better than the book, as I had before, his script is impeccable, his rhymes triumphant narratives, their rhythm is perfect, the constitutions of their actions are a class of cinema, Marlon Brando makes a spectacular interpretation as little before seen in the movies, playing Don Vito Corleone he steals the movie scene in the first act, showing all his logic on ethics of the mafia, while its violence and brutality, in the second and third act who steals the film is the amazing Al Pacino doing an interpretation as ingenious when Brando in the role of Michel, Al Pacino gives an acting show, remained well contained, and completely changing your look from the beginning of the film, you really believe in Michael, the film photography is amazing and helps perpetuate the half dozen scenes that went to the story that this film contains, it is worth mentioning the scenes in Italy and baptized, as well the first 30 minutes of the film, the soundtrack is one of those that you listen and already feel the tone of the film, you play with music, and its perfection, worth highlighting Nino Rota for the soundtrack. Well, Godfather is a film that talks about mafia, drugs, death, violence, illegality, corruption, addiction, etc .. yet he is beautiful, beautiful, it seems ennoble impure acts at the same time cause the same disclaimers, but end you delights and surprises, because it also talks about family, loyalty, friendship and acceptance, watch this movie, even if it is your movie genre, at least try, there's no way you leave the loss with this work as striking the 7 art.

Sorry for my English translator google."
9,WHAT A FILM,"The Godfather is simply a truly great film, that has some of the best acting ever committed to film. Pacino is superb, Brando inspiring and Caan one of cinemas great angry men. It is a film of operatic brilliance and I is the best gangster film ever made."
10,"""Countless, Truly & Magical""","I just love this Movie. I always see something new every time I've seen it ""Countless, Truly & Magical"".

The story of Tragedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do.

I love the Characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The Story-Line, Characteristic, Sounds, Music, Color and Light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people, which are absolutely marvelous. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed.

This Movie is 'Master-Piece' which never be filmed again!"
9,A Movie You Can't Refuse,"The world works differently in 1940's New York City, especially if you were a Sicilian. The Godfather, in all its twists and turns that coincide with the style of living in the mafia, sets itself aside from all other gangster/mob/mafia movies by providing a transformation unlike any other. This change, however, comes from an individual that you, as a watcher, wouldn't want it to come from, until you do. The hook is in the constant re-occurrence of the meaning of loyalty to an Italian.

Advice for first time viewers: watch with someone who has seen it before, because you will get lost at some points and will need the legal and mafia jargon explained."
10,Is The Godfather the greatest film of all time?,"No! But it is in the top five. The Godfather is the king of mobster and mafia films. It goes where no family has ever gone before. Marlone Brando is The Godfather, the head master of the family. His raspy voice is copied by people all over the world, but is never mastered. The Godfather is such a great film. But, I do warn you though. It's a long,long film. I think it's about 3 hours long. If you don't like sitting there for 3 hours watching a movie, then watch it hour by hour. It's a hard decision to make..if The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Some people say yes, others no. I say..and I stand by this..The Wizard of Oz is the greatest film of all time. Yeah, yeah, I'm picking Oz over The Godfather. The Godfather is #3 on my list, which is a pretty hard list to get on. You must watch this film. It's one of America's classics. This comments has taught me many this. It taught me..keep your friends close..and your enemies closer. That's in part 2..but, Hey! Who's keeping up?"
10,Amazing film,This is one of a kind. The acting is perfect. Al Pacino's character goes from a kind hearted man to a man with hardly any heart at all and I love it. The music is amazing sounding like something you would hear at Epcot in the Italy section. The only reason I rated this a 9 and not a 10 is because the beginning is a little slow but it starts moving faster and faster to where it becomes an compelling crime drama.
10,Wow!,"A very well known classic film. The story is what keeps me coming back to this. A mafia boss' son that has managed to stay separate from the family and their dealings, only to gradually be drawn back in as his father's life comes under threat. The transition of this early conflict of the main character is the main force behind this film. Pacino's performance is stand out as one of the best performances of all time. That would be good on its own but there's so much more to offer. All the characters are well fleshed out and Coppola's direction of slowly letting the story unravel whilst giving the actors time and space to portray their characters is genius. Highly recommended."
10,Sublime. Classic. Classy. Brutal. THE gangster movie,"The Godfather is a movie that I first saw on BBC 2 when I was 14 years old. That's 34 years ago.

Its impact on me was immediate and throughout the years whenever I have watched The Godfather it still leaves me with a feeling that I've just seen something great.

The direction from Francis Ford Coppola is pretty much flawless and each actor commits to their roles with skill and passion.

Al Pacino is perfect as Michael and James Caan convinces entirely as the hot headed Sonny.

Marlon Brando is at the height of his acting ability in what is his greatest role as Vito Corleone.

For me this is the greatest gangster film of all time."
10,A true classic.,"The best screen play of all time. The cast, the setting, the storyline, make this movie an all time great. With names like Pacino, Brando and De Niro associated with the Godfather, was it ever going to fail? I don't think so. A true classic, depicting family values in its truest form, a must see for the generations of both today and tomorrow."
10,Powerfull,"Truly an original, powerful, loving story that will never die."
10,do you want to know this movie?,Its a best movie ever that i watch. i think i never have a chance to have taht feel again when i saw godfather.
10,The Godfather is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.,"Being a young man I have not been blessed with being able to see The Godfather when it was originally released, and the thought of seeing this epic on the big screen makes me drool. The story is what drives this masterpiece, not special effects like todays so called epics. I was glued to the my television, watching this film. After you watch this film you find yourself whistling the main theme, and going around talking like Don Corleone. It is a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone tired of todays movies with no story."
10,Superb,"Excellent movie, definitely check it out! One of my all time favourite movies!"
10,Hi powered cast and performances,"This film is by far the best film that I have ever seen. With a cast strewn with some of the best actors in the industry and arguable some of the best ever, delivering such intense performances, they could have won an Oscar for Ishtar. However, they are connected to a brilliant story, script and cinematography, making for a virtually flawless story."
10,Requires Serious Mind to Understand this Masterpiece,No words can define this movie it's100/10 and i still think this rating is way less and who am I to rate this movie.
8,"Not My Favourite, But Deserving","For starters people will now no longer be able to say to me ""I can't believe you haven't watched the Godfather"". If you haven't seen it, I know you too have been told this.

As for the movie, with many often labeling it the greatest movie ever , it puts it under the highest tier of scrutiny for me. For starters, unlike some GOAT movie contenders, I can see how this movie would produce a cult like fan following. Despite there not being a real deep dive into any of the characters for the most part early on, all of them give off strong sentiments of having worked in the family business with the paradoxical idea that life is cheap and yet family is sacred. Trying to keep up with all the different characters for my first viewing was certainly a huge challenge.

The Godfather is very deliberate and is in no hurry. While some complain or joke about the 3 hour runtime I believe all of the time used is critical to building the aura that surrounds the Corleone family. In moving at this speed it allows us to see the fall from innocence of the movies true main character that is Michael Corleone. Unlike many fall from innocence type themes, the Godfathers greatest success is in its believability. While watching you are never made immediately aware of the snapping point within Michael, in fact he is strongly contrasted by his brother Sonny who knows only one way to react to events. However, this makes Michael feel even more dangerous as you can feel the impacts of what occurred to the family grate on him and shift his morals slowly but surely as the movie unwinds.

While , I certainly don't see this as in the greatest of all time debate for me, I appreciate it as extremely high quality cinema especially for an early 70s film. The acting is world class, the score perfectly fitting , and with sets way ahead of its time. For me it didn't have the highest entertainment factor but I certainly think the film deserves its place as a groundbreaking trailblazer that has provided a format for success for many future inspired films."
10,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece","""The Godfather"" is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences more than 50 years after its release with stunning performances, iconic scenes, and unforgettable dialogue.

The story of the Corleone family, a powerful mafia dynasty in 1940s New York. At its core, the film is a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and the high price of power. The Godfather, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is a man of immense influence and respect in the criminal underworld, but when he is targeted for assassination, his son Michael, played by Al Pacino, must step up to take his place and protect the family."
10,"Simply, Greatest Movie of All Time","We are all humans and most of us have a family and those who don't are likely to create their own kind-of-family environment around them. Family means love, devotion, sacrifice, and many other greatest things. Humans surely can't survive on its own and without even a family has even less chance than to stand out. What's a film? For me it's like a book with graphics which makes one person re-live the story with the characters as if he/she was there too. Coming from these two aspects; family & film, I think what movie could be better than a one which shows what family is and makes the one re-live the story of the film. We see a person, a father who would do everything to protect his family. Needless to say, all the actors who played were also the best actors of all time."
10,Best movie of all time,"Best of best!!!

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name.

The Godfather Part III was released on December 25, 1990. Francis Ford Coppola returned as director for the feature-length film, while also writing the screenplay with the help of the author Mario Puzo.

On December 4, 2020, a recut version of the film titled The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone was released in a limited number of theatres as well as being released on Blu-ray and streaming platforms. Coppola said the film is the version he and Puzo had originally envisioned, and it ""vindicates"" its status among the trilogy and his daughter Sofia's performance. Sofia's performance was received negatively by critics. Leonard Maltin, said of the film that the casting of Sofia Coppola was an ""almost-fatal flaw""

10,Second Best film for me off alltime,This is a piece of art. For me it is after The Shawshank Redemption the best movie of alltime. It's just incredible story telling. You never get bored and it's even in 2022 still just factual a good mafia movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are playing magnificent. The music in connection with the movie is just perfect. The whole part in Sicily is realistic and well done. I love that all the people speak italian there. The film is a brand new thing on his own. After the moral code is broken. The whole storyline his full of small side storys. Every side story is good on his own. I just watch this film again every year and it's never boring.
9,interesting pastime,"Quite an entertaining film that I recommend to friends. An entertaining plot will not leave anyone indifferent, a story that makes you think. I definitely advise everyone to watch this sudo cinema."
10,The Godfather Series,"What makes this movie so good? Just about everything. Good acting, good direction, good story, good development...it's weird, but this is one of those cases where the sequel makes it better. Godfather II is the best sequel ever made, and I just don't think you can really say anything about this movie until you've seen that one. Really, you have to look at the first one as the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and the second as his fall. Despite the fact that he doesn't lose power, he loses almost everything else. You don't really get much character development of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in this movie, because it's all being saved for the sequel (in the form of Robert De Niro). The way that the two are intertwined is just absolutely brilliant. As a movie by itself, The Godfather is still a masterpiece. One of the things that I think makes it so compelling is the blurring of the line between good and evil. Just about everyone in this movie is a bad guy. But there are good bad guys and bad bad guys, and we're on the outside trying to decide which ones we want to root for. We end up cheering on the Corleones, the focal point of the movie, but it's very reluctant as the climactic scene unfolds. I found myself right there with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the end, torn between what I know to be right and what has to be done for survival. I cannot imagine this movie being any better. It's fascinating, and the sequel does not do anything to diminish that sense of awe. It's a timeless classic about the battle between good and evil. But does evil really win out? It's impossible to tell."
8,This movie was exceptional,I loved this movie and to this day this movie still has recognition.
10,JUST AMAZING!!!,"The God Father one fo the greatest American Story lines of all time. This hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. The entire series is must watch for those who have never watched it, or need to watch it again.."
10,An immediate classic,If you're Italian you will appreciate how Coppola got it right
10,nice,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.."
10,The best movie ever made...,"The best movie ever made... I think Francis Ford Coppolla's Godfather is best in all ways of directing,acting,musical,cinematographic... Although it tells a story of everything; i mean so many characters you see in movie and different emotions from all type you feel doesn't make you away from story.You become part of this life told in movie.

That is a very serious movie about serious things and be sure i am serious too about;Godfather is best!

Another point is the year that film is made.35 years before,making this movie.Just like a dream.

Mario Puzo , writer of the book is a genius who wrote Superman."
10,The Best,"The best film forever!!!!! The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss."
10,i like it,This was the best movie I've ever seen. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the production and the game for giving me this beautiful feeling.
10,A game changing work of art.,"Breaking the norm by making the audience sympathize with the Mafias, this film is well crafted and holds up the intended emotions in every scene. The dark lives of the mafias do not matter to the audience as they are busy rooting for it's humane characters. Coppola successfully humanizes the characters and maintains the tragic nature of the film."
10,Masterful!,"The Godfather is the best film of all time! Wonderful casting of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan. AA novelty movie that will not be reproduced as it is a generational gem of a movie! Al Pacino is truly the Godfather of all godfathers and his energy and role portrayal will definitely leave you in awe! The classic lines, the twist of the story mixed with the dark scenes of mystery, betrayal, passion and loyalty. One can truly behold why it is voted as the greatest movie of all time! For me, this is the best movie which one should recommend to the younger generation to watch. An OG classic!"
10,My favorite movie ever!!!,"Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,Francis Ford Coppola,Mario Puzo,and the filmhistory.One of the best movies ever.The Godfather always give me power."
10,!!!,"The film really catches with its plot, well-chosen actors and their game, atmosphere, dialogues. The quality of shooting, I think, is quite a subjective moment. Personally, for example, I really liked it and I just can't imagine how it is going to be presented differently."
8,Love from Heart,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic."
10,Changed movies forever,"The original Godfather changed movies forever. The major studios became less important due to its indie makers. I cannot say anything about this film that has not already been said. It is a masterpiece with only its second part and Citizen Kane able to compare to it. The acting, writing, and directing are some of the finest ever to be recorded. Al Pacino peaked in this film with his subtle, yet absolutely effective, portrayal of Michael. Marlon Brando delivers one of Hollywood's finest performances, with the raspy voice and arched eyebrows. James Caan also found his perfect character in the emotional Sonny. Francis Ford Coppola does the finest piece of directing I've ever seen, and Puzo and Coppola's writing presents the audience with memorable characters. Sterling Hayden also steals a scene or two as the police captain. A film that defies time and repeated viewings."
10,second best film ever,"This is the second best film ever made. Only ""The Godfather part 2"" is better. Nothing else need be said, but since I ave to get four lines I will point out that Pacino's transformation in this film is one of the most moving performances in history"
9,Best of the best!,"Casting was a disaster it seems, not confident to go with new actors, not bold enough to put money down for great known actors. It's a mixed bag, along with the delivery of lines and the scenes in general come across very flat and uninteresting.

The music is sufficiently different to be fresh while remaining recognizable. The production quality and cinematography are as expected - fantastic, epic and awe inspiring, aside from a couple of excessively dark scenes that were over and done with very quickly.

There is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and depravity. Incidental background humor. A promise of things to come.

The casting seems to be on point - I saw no issue with any of the characters, and the leads were well chosen for their roles.

The writing seems to be up to par. As an introduction, this episode was written and directed well. I want to see and know more - a good sign.

So far I'm pleased with this return to the land of Westeros. Valar morghulis!"
9,Not enough words to describe cinematic greatness.,"""The Godfather"" has sustained many proclamations throughout the years about the genius that it is, and I had not understood why until viewing it. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1972, this film has a runtime of 2 hours and 55 minutes and makes every use of it. The film had been turned into an on-screen adaptation following the success of Mario Puzo's book released in 1969. The storyline follows a notorious mafia family and their struggle to maintain power during a transitional period between the seasoned patriarch Don Vito Corleone and his reluctant son Michael Corleone.

Now, this film has so many subtle elements that come together to make it such a classic. Never mind that the revolutionary Marlon Brando starred as Don Vito Corleone; but Al Pacino depicts a subtlety to Michael Corleone like I have yet to see in acting. Between their dynamic alone, the film was elevated a few notches. Pacino portrayed Michael's temperament as calculated, quiet, and unassuming, which made his character arc so complex. From the beginning of the film, he wished to remain separate from this dangerous world; his family, especially his father, wanted the same for him. Perhaps, Don Corleone knew what his son was capable of and how he was capable of being fully immersed in this business. As it wraps, the audience begins to understand Don Corleone's reaction when he finds out about Michael's eventual involvement in the family business. The supporting characters included James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, just to name a few, held their own and convinced us that they were all partakers of this dark underworld whether they wanted to be or not.

The cinematography, film score, and masterful direction were critical components to the plot as it aided in creating a world for these on-screen personalities to thrive. The characters were so well-developed that it began to feel like a documentary about real people than fictional characters. Their verisimilitude to life increased believability and heightened the emotional weight of the film. Eventually, you even find yourself rooting for the 'bad guys' even though all of them were considered bad guys. The pacing moved along purposefully to establish sympathy toward the characters' plight and the gripping moments in between the 'slow points' which would keep the audience entertained. Relating to gore, nudity, and profanity, it all seemed to be used in moderation which is surprising in a movie about the underbelly of society. Moreover, the minor use of profanity probably aided in its success because the inspired dialogue proved to be an important aspect in characterization.

For a film created an estimated 5 decades ago, ""The Godfather"" still feels fresh. A mélange of things made this film so successful and if I were to go through them all, my review would be much longer than it is. This is truly a classic in every sense of the word."
10,the medium by which movies are measured,"coppolla's masterpiece stands alone in film history. From the festive begginning to the inevitable end, this movie truly moves one. In the tradition of the greek tragedy, the superb story is crafted on a man trying to evade his fate. Al pacino and Marlon Brando give the performances of their lives, and james Caan executes perfectly as the hotheaded sonny. Props to Coppolla's vision and ingenuity, truly one of the great films of all time."
10,Words are not enough,"The Godfather is a story of love, crime, death, and rise of the Corleones. It's a book painted into a movie so brilliantly that even the likes of Lord Of The Rings fall short. I cannot ever even imagine that there will be any movie as well made as the first two godfather movies."
10,Masterpiece of the cinema,"It's hard to find bad aspects about this movie. It captures the mafia life perfectly, the actors are so good, the story is incredible and the drama is so fascinating that makes the movie extremely intriguing."
10,The Good Old Mafia Movies!,"Grew up on this movie, like millions of others in Russia! Never gets old to watch!"
10,Good,I did not like it to much it was good but not The best
9,A classic movie,"This film, which is regarded as a legend, has finally been seen, holding a sense of sanctity to see the whole movie. In addition to my feeling of being blind to the face of foreigners, it's not bad. There are not too many stories in the last three hours that make you want to fast forward. At first, I feel that the godfather is a bad man, but it's only a matter of interest. At least he has his own principle and likes his saying: ""a man who doesn't often stay with his family will never be a real man."" No matter what happens outside, at least he does a good job in this aspect of family and feels happy at home What's more, I have also seen the sophistication of the world. Why can the godfather get the support of some politicians? Because they owe him more or less. In reality, it's the same thing. Sooner or later, what they owe others will be changed. I don't know whether I understand it or not. But the whole character of the godfather is complex and chaotic, and the actors are also soul level performances, Malone's saying ""never let anyone know what you are thinking"" should also be some of the top, undercover maxims."
10,The Godfather (1972): A Masterful Symphony of Morality and Power,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is not just a movie; it's an experience. Released in 1972, it's become synonymous with cinematic brilliance, captivating audiences for generations with its operatic story of family, loyalty, and the corrosive nature of power.

Marlon Brando delivers a legendary performance as Don Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch of a New York mafia clan. Brando's take on the character is iconic - a mix of quiet menace and surprising tenderness, his raspy voice and deliberate silences speaking volumes.

The film follows the Corleones as they navigate the treacherous world of organized crime, facing betrayal, violence, and the ever-present threat of law enforcement. Coppola masterfully weaves a complex tapestry of characters, each with their own motivations and demons. Al Pacino shines as Michael, the reluctant heir to the Corleone empire, whose transformation from war hero to ruthless consigliere is both chilling and tragic.

Beyond the stellar performances, The Godfather is a technical marvel. Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly complements the film's melancholic tone, while Gordon Willis's cinematography bathes every scene in a rich, golden glow. The editing is masterful, maintaining a steady pace even as the film's three-hour runtime unfolds.

But what truly elevates The Godfather to its legendary status is its exploration of morality. The film doesn't shy away from the ugliness of the Corleones' world, but it also forces us to confront the complexities of human nature. Are the Corleones simply villains, or are they tragic figures caught in a cycle of violence they can't escape?

Coppola doesn't provide easy answers. He leaves it to the audience to grapple with the moral ambiguities of the film, making The Godfather a cinematic experience that stays with you long after the credits roll.

Here are some of the film's strengths:

Stellar performances: Brando and Pacino deliver career-defining performances, while the supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, is equally impressive.

Gripping story: The film's complex plot keeps you guessing until the very end.

Masterful direction: Coppola's direction is assured and meticulous, creating a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film.

Thought-provoking themes: The Godfather raises important questions about morality, family, and the nature of power.

If you're looking for a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it, then The Godfather is a must-watch. It's a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place in film history.

Overall rating: 5 out of 5 stars

I hope this review gives you a good sense of why The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to do so. You won't be disappointed.

Please let me know if you have any other questions about the film. I'm always happy to discuss it further!"
10,Great Movie,"The Godfather (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, stands as one of the most influential films in cinema history. Far more than a conventional crime story, it is a rich, multi-layered exploration of family, power, loyalty, and the darker sides of the American Dream. With a superb cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, the film seamlessly blends riveting drama with profound thematic depth.

At its heart, The Godfather follows the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia dynasty navigating power struggles in post-World War II America. The patriarch, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), embodies the archetype of a powerful yet moral crime boss, a man whose influence comes from calculated wisdom, not raw violence. Brando's Oscar-winning performance, with his distinctive voice and imposing presence, is unforgettable. Vito is a man of contradictions: loving and devoted to his family, yet involved in a world of crime. This duality defines the film, where personal loyalty and criminal ruthlessness intersect.

Al Pacino's Michael Corleone provides the film's most captivating transformation. At the start, Michael is the ""good"" son, a war hero who has distanced himself from the family's mafia dealings. However, as events spiral out of control, particularly after an assassination attempt on his father, Michael is drawn into the family business. His descent into the mafia world is portrayed with chilling subtlety, and Pacino's restrained performance builds to a devastating crescendo. By the film's end, Michael has fully embraced the cold, calculating role."
10,nice film,Nice to see the movies & learn lot of thinks..........................................................................................
10,One of the best movies ever,"Having the opportunity to see the performance of Marlon Bandon and Al Pacino in the same picture is a luxury. The performance of Al as Michael is greta, to see the transformation of his character from a war hero to the most dangerous capo of the moment."
10,I'm gonna make a movie nobody can refuse.,"The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This has been called the greatest movie of all time by many film buffs. I prefer Star Wars a bit more though, but that doesn't mean I hate this classic. I love this movie and I can see why it has received praise across the globe.

A movie that heavily involves family matters and crime of course. I'm not sure whether to call this an action film though some top critics have dubbed the Godfather as a top rate action movie, but it doesn't have the over-the-top action of Michael Bay movies. This one has better action because you can soak it in and understand what's going on, not just watch it and forget it like the action scenes in Transformers 2.

""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" When you hear that line, you're in the world of cinema. When will they make another movie like this again? Let's hope it's soon. The Godfather is that kind of movie that deserves all the attention and respect it gets."
10,Family power,"This is the drama about an Italian family with a serious influence to the society and contributed a large part to the crime wave in the 1930's. The movie also talk about the family value and how they stick together in any situation Don Vito Corleone, head of the family, who had build up his own mob empire. He dealt in pretty much anything,from drug to robberies. He had some serious pull in the US government. Politicians eat out of his hand like birds. He was one of the most powerful men at that time until he got shot by one of his rivals. Thats when Michael, his son, comes into play.

Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, World War I hero, after the military, he went home to stay with the family. After his father got shot, he took the liberty to protect the family service by killing a corrupted cops along with his partner who happens to be Vito's rival and shooter. Michael did just that and he had to move out of the country for a while until the heat is off of him. He returns several years after and took over the family."

9,A great watch,"Never get bored of watching this movie again and again. It truly is an epic and a classical worth a billion likes and a rating of 9.

1st time I watched this movie was in my teens and had a different perspective - the violence and action really attracted me to it. But now after almost.

10 years when I watch it, it gives me the view into the culture, family ties, what, why and how of the movie. All this is so engrossing and a treat to eye that one imagines what if would feel like to live in such a time or be a part of such an influential family.

So for all of you just get a hang of the DVD or watch the entire collection, its worth time, money and effort.

Overall suggestion a must watch for any movie buff."
10,One of the Greatest Movies of all time!,"Godfather is truly an iconic movie and one of Marlon Brando's most epic performances as an Actor. This movie represents, what it's like to be truly involved in the Italian Mafia, traditional family values, loyalty and most importantly to honor your word. Regardless of the years that go by, the Godfather will always remain as one of those movies, that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
10,Best Movie Ever Made,"The Godfather is the best movie ever made. I recommend it to everybody who hasn't seen it, you don't know what your are missing. Its perfection that's why gave it a 10 in rating. Every time I see the movie again it amazes me how good it is."
9,What can you say?,"This to me is the second greatest mafia, gangster, movie of all time, behind Goodfellas. Perhaps one could argue that since the GF came first it should take the title as the best, but I'm not making that argument.

Its a bit of a shame that so many parody's and jokes have come about over time because in a way it cheapens what is something quite special.

Brilliant script/story, well paced, filled to the brim with acting megastars all backed up by a beautiful score.

A cool classy masterwork."
10,Best,"There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale."
9,best film of 19 which i have watch,It was good enough to represent every character with a different style and best script I love all the characters. And all love the casting done by them.
8,Must Watch,I just love this movie although the its bit slow. Every character in the movie were so real. You MUST watch it at least once.
10,The Best,The Godfather Simply The Best in Everything in Many Ways I Love it
10,Masterpiece of all movies!,"The Godfather trilogy, and particularly its first two films, are iconic and ingratiated in the American cultural discussions of cinema and art so deeply that they're hard to parse from their legendary status. They're timeless epics that serve the viewer and the cinema-lover better as tall tales of kings, not as any introspective look at America or the 'immigrant experience.' From an artistic standpoint, their place in cinema is unquestioned in terms of its indelible effect on culture. One can gather that if the apex of Hollywood studio filmmaking in all its capitalist limitations, can be capped at using the visual tools of cinema at the service of a story, I can't think of many movies that do it better than The Godfather."
10,A movie for a Lifetime,"Everything in this movie is great the acting ,the directing, the script and this masterpiece every time you don't find a good movie to watch re-watch this film and feel the greatness of it."
10,Best mafia movie ever,"I have always loved mafia movies like Goodfellas but The Godfather trilogy is just so much better.

Marlon Brando is just amazing and the other actors (especially Al Pacino and James Caan) are also really good. The film is very long but it didn't bother me and it certainly isn't boring like some people have said. Much of the length is caused because Coppola put great care into making his characters seem ""real"". And concentrating on the family rather than the crime business, Coppola and Puzo put an amazing depth into the characters.

Simply put: The best mafia movie ever."
9,How Did I Not See This Sooner?!,"This was one of those films I was 'not allowed to stay up for' when I was much younger, but having received the DVD box set for Xmas, I watched all three on consecutive nights.

What talent! What a story! What cinematography! How did I miss this in my teens and twenties??

For me, one of the greatest surprises was having a look at early performances of great talent that started careers... Robert Duvall was already well-known, and this cinched him. James Caan - one of my favourites -and this showed me why - again. Pacino -I admit, I was never tha impressed, and wondered what the fuss was about....then I saw 'The Godfather'.

So many have tried to follow it - so few succeeded.

Fantastic stuff. Deserves to be where it is in cinema history."
10,Great Movie !,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialog is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy about it."
10,This is an offer you cant refuse!,"I loved this movie. I always used to think it was over-hyped but i finally watched the entire movie in whole not too long ago and i totally see why everyone has been raving about it for years. I also watched other mafia movies such as Scarface, Goodfellas, and Casino and none of them even compared to the great godfather. I honestly cannot say who does better in this movie Brando's character is one for the ages, Pacino is so convincing it gives me chills, Cahn's character is played so well you cant even explain why you like the guy so much, and Duvall is magnificent as the cool under fire lawyer. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out...i know i was."
10,The Godfather is Amazing,You thinking why I am said The Godfather is amazing when You Show then you know why I am said the godfather is amazing.
10,Actor/Actress Match up ....Perfect for Role Characterization,"Perhaps the single greatest movie I have ever seen. I was a student back then at Arizona State and I had heard about it from others shortly after it was released. At first after seeing it for the 1st time I thought the Don was wicked....then after seeing it several times he was actually protecting his loved ones even though he was in criminal activities yet many of his moves were handing out needed justice that the courts did not provide his fellow Italians with in NY. I saw the strong family values in him yet it was hard for me to realize his was a dark career. He created his own empire from zero having got off the boat all by himself as a very young boy after watching his family murdered in Italy, but what he saw from that was what raw power could do for a person from what that Italian Don had done to his own family. I think it internally made him gain same type of absolute power yet try to use it with fairness in family and related situations. He was not a wild cut throat Don.....there was honor in his power and we all could see it. Wonderful movie of an immigrant coming to America all alone and with perseverance and actual self preservation rise to power his people and lead them through then American tough times for most. He not only won the battle....he won the war as he saw it."
10,Amazing Movie,Thank you Alpacino for this amazing performance You are the best actor ever
9,i never seen this type of movie ....amazing,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene."
10,The play of Godfather,"The play of Godfather only follows one formula, that is, the classic mode of power passing on from generation to generation.

The structure of the story is very delicate, and the plots echo each other. The irony of the film's title is that it ultimately refers not to the father, but to the son. At the beginning of the film, Michael not only didn't get involved in the family business, but also planned to marry Kay Adams, a Protestant high-class American. Later, he saved his father's life by moving his father's bed in the hospital, and whispered in the ear of the comatose old man: ""I'm with you now."" From then on, his life took another road."
9,"Don't hate your enemy, it will affect your judgment.","The Italian church and the representative of the underworld of the successful people in the United States and other capitalist countries in the world of escape, adventure, foothold, revenge, whitewash growth history, mixed knead knead the family, love, friendship in different circumstances under the birth and destruction. Family interests above all, all against the growth and development of the family must be destroyed. The coexistence of interests is the basis of harmony, and the difference of interests is the beginning of hostility. The old godfather dies, the new godfather is born. Is the beginning of the end which cannot be stopped."
10,Great work,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me."
10,LIKE IT,Love it classic movie. I love the light and the contrasta. The shadows on this movie are so fantastic.
10,Nice,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..

Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.

This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
8,Brilliant,The best crime killer all time and I must say master work no other film has done such a wonderful job like this film.
10,A masterpiece,"The Godfather is often spoken about in such reverential terms that it feels impossible to say something new about it. Is there another film in history which has had so many books written about it? With that in mind, I think it's fair to ask, ""does it live up to the hype?"" and ""is it worthy of its place at the top of so many best-of lists?""

The answer to those questions is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. Not everyone's going to love The Godfather. Some people might not care for mob dramas or might be turned off by the violence in this film, but for those who are open to this film I think it's unquestionably one of the finest in its genre. You've got pretty much everything you want here, a great story, great acting, exceptional direction, moments of suspense, drama and intrigue, and a satisfying conclusion.

That's not to say that The Godfather is perfect. There are a few scenes which could've been either cut completely, or at least cut shorter, and there are a few things that I would've liked to have seen fleshed out in more detail. However, despite these minor quibbles there's a reason why this film is rated so highly. It's a landmark piece of art that still resonates strongly over 50 years after its release."
9,The Godfather - Beauty in an image,"I just love the cinematography in this title, the way the camera moves and shows scenes and actors is just amazing.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The way this film has made me feel is just incredible and I hope it finds more fans."
8,Don't Take This Review Too Seriously,"Once upon a time, in the suburbs of the Big Apple, there was a man named Vito Corleone who made his fortune selling olive oil. The Corleone family's olive oil business was top-notch, thanks to a combination of quality products and a unique customer appreciation campaign that included complimentary silencers and silk ties. With such marketing genius, it's no wonder they became the envy of their rivals.

Then, a Turkish businessman wanted to get into the olive oil game in America. So, he asked Vito to invest in his operation. Fearing that Turkish olive oil was corrupting the youth, Vito turned him down. This refusal led to a feud, and in a botched assassination attempt at a fruit vendor, Vito miraculously survived. The family's fortunes took a nosedive, and the youngest son, Michael, skipped town to Italy to lay low and search for new olive oil sources. Meanwhile, the eldest son, Sonny, took over the family business but met a tragic end when he was gunned down at a toll plaza. After his brother's demise, Michael returned to the U. S. with a determination to stabilize olive oil prices once and for all...

The Godfather not only vividly portrays the fierce competition of the 1940s olive oil market; but also offers a treasure trove of life lessons that you'd find in a Chicken Soup for the Dark Soul book or a fortune cookie written by a mobster. Francis Ford Coppola's transformation of this olive oil odyssey into a trilogy of films, all bearing the same title yet each possessing its unique charm, is a cinematic rarity that exposes the absurdity of the industry. Coppola's direction, combined with the stellar performances, ensures that the misadventures of the Corleone family will captivate audiences for generations to come. After all, who knew olive oil could be the root of all evil, or so it seems?"
9,"This is not a gangster, mafia movie. This is a art!","As I wrote in the title, this movie is not just a mafia movie. It is a work of art that demonstrates the importance of respect and that action is more important than words. I don't even need to go into other topics. The acting is super, the cinematography is super, everything is super. And I want to mention one more thing. I think the flow of the movie, that is, the math of the entrance, development and result, and the sequences of the scenes are handled very well and harmoniously. God bless hands of eveyone who contributed it. Watch it, show it."
10,Best movie ever.,"""The Godfather"" along with ""The Gofather: Part II"" are the best movies I have ever seen. Absolutely everything of it is magnificent, pure magic, gold, etc. The performances, the directing, the screenplay, the production, the script, the soundtrack, the film editing, the costume design, and the list goes on and on. The performances are excellent, all of them, through that you can see all the work the director Francis Ford Coppola made, which is one i truly admire. This movie is irreplaceable, a true piece of art. A classic. It involves love, crime, passion, negotiations, family, loyalty, respect. For me is just the perfect combo, because I love movies with violence, I also love movies with romance. I think there will never be a movie as perfect as this one."
10,The Lessons are Great,"I didnt see The Godfather trilogy until very recently. I heard about it's greatness from everywhere, so I decided to take look at them. By far, I thought that The Godfather was a great movie, because not only is it a great Mafia/Cosa Nostra movie, it subtly throws in messages of the importance of family and respect. That is why I think this movie is a ten. The Godfather will stand the test of time, and it will be a movie I want my kids to see (when theyre a little older of course)."
10,the best,I just can say I'm very happy to life in this world with this film
10,it was great,"This movie one of the greatest movies in all time, but i think it is not for 2000s generation."
10,Perfect!,"This is the best movie i have ever seen. Great scenario, perfect acting... A Complete masterpiece."
9,God film,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It follows the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American Mafia clan, as they struggle to maintain their control over their empire amid a series of violent conflicts.

The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and for good reason. It features an incredible ensemble cast, led by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles as the patriarch of the Corleone family, and Al Pacino in his breakthrough performance as Michael Corleone, the youngest son who becomes embroiled in the family's criminal activities. The film is expertly directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who creates a world that is both gritty and glamorous, and filled with memorable characters and scenes.

One of the strengths of The Godfather is its ability to balance its violence and brutality with its moments of quiet contemplation and character development. The film explores themes of loyalty, family, power, and tradition, and does so with a depth and complexity that is rare in the crime genre. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is filled with iconic lines and scenes that have become part of the cultural lexicon.

The Godfather is not a perfect film, however. It seems pacing slow or the plot overly complex, and the film's treatment of women and minorities has been criticized for being sexist and racist. Additionally, the film's glorification of organized crime and violence has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that it romanticizes a dangerous and destructive lifestyle."
10,A masterpiece when you look at it a second time,"I' ve already watched The good father a first time and honestly It was a not masterpiece at all even I mean I thought it was a overrated movie... due to long script and not so many action from mafia movie, but when you watch it a second time you get it well, why this is a masterpiece from cinema industrie !

First to all the script its finally very good, this a movie who telling a story and you have following each moments of the movie but at the end when you finished to watch this second movie a second times you realize that it was a passionate story and you travel during so many differents moments !!! Even if it looks like as a long story to teelling you will feel boring in front and well you miss something cause this is like I sayed it's a passionate story and you mustn't take your eyes off the story because I think you're missing out on a great film and it's better to watch it a second time to better understand certain moments to get a good storytelling experience !!!

The directing from Francis Coppolla was great for old movie like this cause it's noit the same stuffs that nowdays and for old times it was great but for our time currently the directing will be bad due to the shoots makes but I think so this kinda directing and shoots make the brand of the movie( the long shoots, the bad play lightings...) and that it's great honestly !

The acting was enough good, all credit on Marlon Brando who played an old man and he played suchelly great with thistype of voice and the great make up onhis face and so many great mimics during his lines even all credit for the rest of the cast and the great Al pacino also !

The soundtrack was crazy I think so one of the best of all time time, you don't need to watch two times the movie to get it that the sountrack its great, it was very perfect soundtrack in all moments and this one it is the proof !!!"
10,"In American motion pictures, it's as authorative as its title role","It's amazing to think, having listened to Francis Ford Coppola's DVD commentary, that his 1972 epic The Godfather was produced under such incredible studio and financial pressure  one can only imagine what this picture could have been if Coppola was given a little more control. To this day, The Godfather remains a classic, truly extraordinary, and etched into the memories of all who've seen it. It is one of the most widely acclaimed and financially successful films of all time, consistently among the top film lists of most, and is my personal favourite motion picture.

Set in 1940's New York, The Godfather tells the tale of the patriarch of a mafia organization, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)  a man who commands enormous authority and power  and both his literal and figurative families. When the Don refuses a proposition by the drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo, believing that narcotics is ""a dirty business"", Sollozzo  backed by the power of a rival mafia family headed by Don Phillip Tattaglia  orders an assassination attempt. Don Corleone barely survives the shooting and, for the love for his father, Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) decides to take action, masterminding a calculated move that will forever draw him in to the life of crime he always wanted to avoid.

The cast assembled for The Godfather can lay claim to being possibly the greatest ensemble ever featured in an American film. Marlon Brando's career-reviving turn as the Godfather himself has already cemented its place in cinematic history  no more needs to be said. Al Pacino demonstrates a remarkable transformation from idealistic youth to cold, calculated heir to the Corleone throne. James Caan as Sonny, the Don's eldest son, is as explosive, violent, and temperamental as the pages of Puzo's bestseller describe, and Robert Duvall as adopted son and family Consiglieri (Counsellor) Tom Hagen is all logic and composure. But the praise should rightly stretch out to all, even those in small roles, as all play a part in making Coppola's world of Italian culture and underworld crime authentic and believable.

When I try to pin down what it is, exactly, that makes a motion picture a ""classic"", I can't help but return to the notion of how memorable it is. This is ultimately where The Godfather qualifies  just about everything in this film is memorable in one way or another. We remember the acting  there is not a more iconic performance committed to film than Brando's Don Corleone. We remember Gordon Willis' celebrated cinematography, from the shadowy, atmospheric tension created in the offices where ""business"" is dealt, to his presentation of the sweeping, sun-kissed landscapes of Sicily. We remember the beautiful themes of Nino Rota's score  the haunting, lone trumpet that opens the picture and the full- fledged orchestral arrangement of the instantly recognizable ""Godfather Love Theme"". And who could forget the masterful inter-cutting during The Godfather's climactic baptism sequence?

From the opening shot of the thickly accented undertaker proclaiming ""I Believe in America"", to final unforgettable shot in the Don's quarters of the door closing on Diane Keaton, who finally realises the truth of what has happened, Coppola has attained a directorial quintessence with The Godfather that he may never again reach. While watching the picture, we simply cannot wait until the time comes to sit down and view it again. It's a rare quality in a film, and the hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece."
9,Must Watch Movie,I watch this movies all the parts... No doubt .. if you like to watch underworld movie.. this one will be your first choice to watch.. i really like all the parts of this Godfather. amazing work by all the stars. first and second part of this movie is my favorite.
10,Best Movie of All Time!!!,"The Godfather has to be the best movie of all time. It not only captivates the criminal aspect but the loyalty and business savvy of a mafia family. This movie is also great because it was the rock of many careers of our most notable and best actors and actresses. Al Pacino, Abe Bagoda, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppala, Marlon Brando, and James Caan along with many others. Now whenever you see an organized crime movie anywhere it will be compared to the mafia story. This movie also teaches you some important roles to live by. Be careful who you trust. Also keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. If you haven't seen The Godfather trust me ""it's an offer you can't refuse."""
10,Organised Crime Goes To Hollywood! What's changed? Nothing!,"Francis Coppola's The Godfather, and Godfather pt. II have made their names known rightfully as masterpieces of cinema. They are both executed with razor-like care and crafted atop a foundation of brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a brilliant script by a brilliant writer, brilliant photography, brilliant production design, and a brilliant score. And it was the first film to give mainstream insight to the world of Ogranised Crime - an insight so true that Mario Puzo was questioned by the Mafia about his sources.

But The Godfather is not just a vehicle of power for its wonderful foundations and brilliant everything, it is a drama about war between families - about destruction within families. From the film's buoyant wedding opening scene, we are instantly emerged in Coppola and Puzo's world of rich characters and gripping stories. This film could have been about a mining family in the nineteenth century - though things would have to change - and it would still be as entertaining, as tragic, as exciting, and as masterful as it is just now."
10,Forever classic,A movie that has been watch through different generations and still finding a place among the best. A true classic that will always be interesting to watch again.

10,Francis Ford Coppola has made us an offer we can not refuse,"Well where can I start it was just fantastic from start to finish. The mix of innocent Michael getting mixed up, to becoming the most street-wise mob boss of all time. I was just gripped by this. All the actors in this movie are top notch and especially with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in it. Also the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton who have made a real name for themselves a real name from this movie. I could not get enough of Michael Corleone, that icy character that hardly lost his temper, and never would let you know what he was thinking, really gripped into watching this movie over and over again.my hat comes off to Francis and his team they have made a true masterpiece that is THE GODFATHER."
9,A technically and artistically perfect movie,"It took me years to sit down and watch it, because I assumed it was a film made for men only, i.e. Another recital of machismo. I was surprised to find myself engaged with the movie from the very beginning. The magnificent acting, the incredible character development and the variety of different personalities, in combination with the outstanding storytelling, direction, cinematography, atmosphere, music, drew me into this brutal tale about toxic masculinity and life degradation. It's a movie that provoked contradictory feelings to me. The more I watched, the more appalled I felt by what people can turn into once they gain power and at the same time, the more interested I got into the fates of those horrible people. It's quite an irresistible trap masterfully set by super talented actors and creators, that produced iconic moments that linger. To me, there is a certain allure about old cinema, in contradiction to nowadays' fast-food film making. I was quite bothered though, by the little room this long movie left for women's presence. I understand the need to realistically portray the patriarchal life in mafia, where women are treated like props, like merely male successors-generators, but I felt there was a lack in balance, as we only get to see a glimpse of what this life was like for the women involved. Nevertheless, it is a great movie I would actually re-watch."
10,Books to Read After Watching The Godfather,"If you just watched The Godfather (1972) again and found yourself wishing there was more to the story, you're not alone. The depth of the Corleone family saga leaves a lot of fans wanting more - and that's where The Godfather Returns by Mark Winegardner comes in. It fills in the gaps between the original Godfather storylines, expanding on characters like Tom Hagen and Fredo. I found a hardcover copy at Used Book Depot, and honestly, it's a great follow-up for any fan of the original film. It stays true to the tone while offering new perspectives and depth. Highly recommended if you're a Godfather fan looking for your next read."
8,Such an amazing movie,"Godfather contains drama,crime and u will find twist here.Slow movie but u have to rate it after seeing"
10,I love this movie. Always have always will,"""The Godfather, directed by the masterful Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. Marlon Brando's portrayal of the enigmatic Don Vito Corleone is a masterclass in acting, radiating power and vulnerability. The film's intricate storytelling, rich character development, and haunting score by Nino Rota contribute to its timeless allure. As we witness the Corleone family's evolution, led by Al Pacino's Michael, the narrative becomes an operatic exploration of power, loyalty, and the consequences of choices. The Godfather's influence on filmmaking is profound, setting the standard for crime epics. The meticulous attention to detail, coupled with stellar performances, crafts an immersive experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It's a cinematic symphony of storytelling, making The Godfather not just a movie but a cultural landmark that continues to captivate generations of film enthusiasts."""
10,More than just a mob movie,"This masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola explores the Corleone family much deeper than just their business activity. It is worth watching every single second to really understand the complexity of the mob. In addition to a great plot, the acting is just superb."
10,"Wonderful movie, even better book","This is Cinema history. The acting is beautiful. The story is excellent. The writing is great. Every man can relate to this movie because they see qualities in these men; Vito(we see the man we want to be, wise and caring to his own), Sonny(the strong man, fierce and respected for such), Fredo(the beloved son, but jealous), Tom (smart, serious, but a bit of an outsider), and of course Micheal (the sucessor to the family name). If you like this movie, read the book. Its even better."
10,Magnificent,"I love this film, it grips me from start to finish each time I watch it. For me it is impeccable without any faults, it delivers a wonderful family story encroached with the difficulties of a Mafia family.

If you expect a film to be of the typical Hollywood sort with action, action, action don't watch it because you will be too thick to appreciate it. Put simply, stick with your average nonsense because this is'nt it. The Godfather is touching, gripping, beautifully shot, with every scene outstandingly directed, and with so much detail inscribed in it.

It is a timeless classic, with some of the best acting you are likely to ever see, and a great script that takes the viewer over from the very opening scene.

Wonderful classic, superbly shot, wonderfully executed and deserved of number one spot on IMDb. Watch it and love it."
10,Fantastic,It was really fantastic. Great Marlon Brandon and Al Pachino.
10,Absolutely mind blowing!,"""The Godfather"" shows us all how high can the grade of a movie be. How a movie can become a standard and continue to rule over the years. Even in this edge of ultra- modern technology, ""The Godfather"" totally shakes the very basic of my movie knowledge. I've never imagined. Ever! It just takes control over my mind."
9,cinematic masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is an undeniable cinematic masterpiece that flawlessly weaves a tale of power, family, and organized crime. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone is nothing short of mesmerizing, while the film's intricate storytelling and compelling characters leave an indelible mark. Francis Ford Coppola's direction, coupled with a stellar cast, creates a timeless classic that transcends the crime genre. The meticulous attention to detail and a haunting musical score contribute to the film's enduring impact, making it a must-watch for any cinephile. Moreover, the film's portrayal of the mafia underworld is both gritty and authentic, painting a vivid picture of a world governed by its own set of rules!"
10,Came across this beauty.,"Looking through old movies, I stumbled on this movie and what a find! It's absolutely perfect. I wonder why people don't quote it all the time. It's always nice when you find these little hidden gems."
10,Wonderful movie,"Scenario, directing, representation and cinematography masterpiece"
10,The greatest film ever created,"I mean - Is there even a competition? Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, Citizen Kane - as great as these Films are, none of them even comes close to this Masterpiece. Truly cinema-changing gem wich does everything right."
10,The Greatest American Film Ever Made,"Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is perhaps the best gangster story ever told and the best film ever made. It's an enriching, engrossing, and evocative look into the criminal underworld in perspective of the Corleone family. This is also one of the rarest films to come out without any flaws. As far as it goes, The Godfather is literature for movie-goers and respectfulness for critics. It boasts legendary performances, excellent direction, a brilliant script, and a smooth, peaceful soundtrack.

This film wouldn't have been this good if not for Marlon Brando's absolutely amazing performances as Don Vito Corleone. His character has gone down in history as one of the most sophisticated, yet graceful characters of Cinema. Brando is widely known today as the greatest actor that's ever lived. Al Pacino, is brilliant, if not perfect in this film. He plays Michael Corleone with a certain innocence, yet jealousy for all he's worth. This actor is also known as one of the best actors in the world. You would have to also thank an excellent supporting cast that includes people like Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is trustworthy and often rewarding, as he leads this film in the right direction. The sets and scenery are often beautiful and intriguing, which matches the silent tone of this film. Since this is set in very old periodic places, this is a great example of old New York and Italy. The greatest scene in this film involves only Brando and Corleone. It's a scene of such scope and emotions that it's hard to describe it.

Even though this material is based on Mario Puzo's wonderful books, it's hard to notice it. The film is so fluent and straightforward, that it's hard to pick up any flaws or evident mistakes in this. The writing is nevertheless excellent and even though there's no narration, this film never leaves you bored.

And last, the soundtrack by Nino Rota is quite something. It's a very smooth, soothing soundtrack that is based on Italian music. This is very original and never leaves you disappointed with itself.

Overall, there's no doubt this is an examination of American classical Cinema. Completely flawless and highly recommended for any movie buff. If you haven't seen The Godfather, then I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse. See it and you will definitely adore it."
10,I Love It,"I love this movie, it is one of the best to ever watch. I would highly recommend. The title itself is attractive ""The Godfather"". Since it was released in 1972 it makes it one of the most notable movie in the history..."
10,This is a classic,"Movie of all time, it doesn't get old whenever i watch it. Always something to learn and look forward to. Francis Ford Coppola is a genus. The thought process is extremely amazing.

Sometimes we forget who we are, but the movie puts one straight back on track.

This is definitely a classic.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

Absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good.

It is a classic."
8,THE GODFATHER (1972) - 16/10/2019,"From it's stellar opening wedding scene to it's bittersweet conclusion, The Godfather is a groundbreaking and brilliantly made film that deals with themes of power, corruption and family with subtly and finesse. Easily one of the greatest movies ever made.

Mitchell Bulfin"
9,I like novel about the godfather,"Now, i can watching him on movie. It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming."
9,Great Story,"The Godfather is a great piece of American cinema. It shows the rise of Michael into the position of Godfather. The story is told with great acting, cinematography and music. SHould be on everyone's to watch list.

Al Pacino is great as Michael and he acting abilities really shines in this one. He definitely showed us that he would be one of the greatest actors of his generation. Al teamed up with Marlon Brando, a great from his generation, Cinematic heaven.

It was a great start to the trilogy and an even better start to Mr. Coppola's career."
10,One of the best films of it's kind and genre!,Like Scarfaced this film can be watched and rewatched many times for decades to come!
10,oraio,Vraio poly kalo bravo nai bravo ti allo na grapso ante gia
10,Possibly the best movie anyone will ever see,"Possibly the best mob movie, and possibly the best movie you will ever see. This movie has plenty of mob violence and extreme thinking to find out the enemy that hides in the shadows. Marlon Brando is possibly the best actor you can find for a godfather. The unexpected son Michael becomes the Godfather and is violent and will destroy whatever enemy opposes the Corleones. It also had a great ending, where the two people kiss Michael on the hand, where he is officially the Godfather. Great movie."
8,The Godfather is one of the great classic American films,"One of the great classic American films of the 20th century, The Godfather, directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based off of the novel of the same title by Mario Puzo is often considered to be the most influential film that created the 'organized crime' or mafia/gangster genre in cinemas.

Since its release in theaters in 1972, it has garnered a cult following among fans which led to 'The Godfather' becoming a trilogy with Parts Two and Three both released in following years."
10,Great,Classic! The best film i've ever seen. My grandchilds will be know this film.
9,Familia taking care of business,"One of the best thing about this film is the terrific performance of Brando asDon Vito Corleone. He created a character capable for transmitting themost ambiguous emotions. For one side, we have the loving father (and godfather of course), husband, grand father, friend. In the other hand he is one of the coldest blooded characters in movie history. ""It's not personal, it's strictly business"" is the perfect phrase to define the way of the ""Familia"" taking care of business related activities. There are several sequences that have become classic scenes: at the beginning of the movie we see a merciful Vito sitting in his ""throne"" deciding the destiny of dishonored fathers, Hollywood actors, rude bodyguards. ""Remember that some day I will ask another favor in return"". Don Vito is respected as a priest, his hand is kissed and he takes care of the situations one way of another. Religion is, ironically, one of the main characters of the history. Four major scenes are related with catholic rites: Two weddings, a funeral and a baptize. Italian costumes are essential as well. The family concept, the traditions; big dinners with pasta, meat balls and red wine. Concepts as honor, loyalty, vengeance are reminded consistently along the three hours. In another classic scene we visualize the ""familia"" way to solve some pending issues: Johnny, the favorite Vito's godsons is one of the hottest Hollywood stars hoping to obtain the leading role in a movie. The producer does not want him on the film for personal reasons, but at the end he accepts once he discovers his favorite horse head the next morning in his bed. Robert Duvall is the adviser, Vito's right hand and in my opinion the second best performance. He is responsible of dealing with the other families. He hates violence but justify every decision to use it. He is the conscience and a critical member, no matter if he is not Sicilian. Other sequence (I think the best) is where the big families have a meeting to solve their differences. Don Vito did not want to be involved in the drug business, he wanted to remain with the usual ones: gambling, liquor and unions. His relation ships with influent people are important to the mob environment. He agrees to permit the drug dealing and offers protection just with one condition: at this time his son Sonny (performed by James Caan) was brutally killed. He accepts his dead as a part of the business and he is willing to make a truce to stop the blood spill. In one of the best scenes ever performed by Brando he stands up and says (not literally): ""I won't revenge my son's death. Mike, my other son is hiding somewhere in Italy and he will return shortly. I accept the conditions to bring peace, but if my son is murdered in any way, shoot accidentally by a cop, have a car accident or appears hanging in his cell I will blame someone in this room"" an then he signed his agreement with a huge with his enemy. A good movie with excellent cast selection, including a good performance of young Al Pacino and his incidental transformation from war hero to new family Don. Coppola created a myth with his trilogy. The second part was actually better than the first one and this is much to say. The baptize sequence at the end is just extraordinary. The initiation of the new Don receiving the holy water and holy blood. A new life, a new grandson, a new era. The end is just the beginning. The familia is not dead is just taking care of business as usual."
10,No.1 film in my heart!,"The Godfather set a new standard for cinematic storytelling I think. It continues to be admired by filmmakers and make everyone attracted. Its influence on subsequent crime dramas is immeasurable, and its characters, themes, and visual style have become touchstones in film history. It's a film that demands multiple viewings, each time revealing new layers of meaning and reinforcing its status as an enduring masterpiece of American cinema. Brando's performance is legendary, stunning and attractive. Vito from a mere mob boss into a figure of almost Shakespearean complexity - a man who is both ruthless in business and deeply devoted to his family. His raspy voice, measured movements, and a subtle twinkle in his eye create a character that is both terrifying and oddly sympathetic."
9,Fantastic with only mild flaws,"I just rewatched he's this for the second time, and man, this flick is great! The may be the best movie I've ever seen at building tension and allowing a story and its characters to breathe and develop naturally. Plus, it's fun!

A few flaws. I know that this is a movie about men made by men for men, but this film does a massive disservice to the female characters. They're either silent or whiney. They're all basically the same character. It was a missed opportunity to not have a female character have some depth and be more involved in the story arch.

There's also a few parts that drag a little. I don't think the film needed to show so many scenes in Italy, for example.

However, bravo! This movie is great and I hope they make one and only one sequel."
10,Great Cinematography,"Shots are well framed and awesome cinematography by Gordon Willis ASC.

This is a great film with great Crew Story is mind blowing This movie has 3 Oscar (Academy Awards)"
10,Nice,I saw the full movie that is totally marvelous. Love the producers and love the creators who produce the awesome movie for us.........................................................................................
9,Great film.,"So great! The godfather it's one of the most revered movies of all the time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you into the world of Mafia while being impressed by technical and narrative aspects. The movie based on the Mario Puzo Novo of the same name. Absolutely I loved this movie, it makes you enjoy with a story. It makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, the way of handling situation like a game, make your heart pound faster, sweat and relief. The way this the godfather presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance and falling everything. This movie will give you experience and aspect of life with characters. The problem in this film is most people are so used to fast-paced films such as action film or series, it is extremely tough to hold their attention span for even less than five minutes unless something interesting or twist happen throughout the film. And the technicolor provides a memorable look for the film, the soundtrack is one of the most memorable in this movie. The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing actor, and I like some scene such as scene of funeral, in this scene themed of soundtrack still remains iconic in my mind. So that this movie is one of a masterpieces classic movie of I have ever seen. I think the godfather is the greatest film in history, Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime with innovative storytelling, direction and astounding performances."
10,Nr.1 till now and in the next 100 years,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.

Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.

MMR Top 150 banner Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.

Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.

Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).

It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance."
10,The Best,"I have watched almost all the mafia movies, but this one is.... Not explainable, you have to watch it before you die"
10,A MOVIE YOU CAN'T REFUSE,"The Godfather Trilogy spreads motivation, like no one movie until today. I don't want to say that it is the best movie ever (because you shouldn't compare movies just like that), but I haven't seen anything like this. It is more than a movie, it is a lifestyle."
10,Very good mob movie,This movie is not one of my favorite crime movies but it is still very good I never read the book but the movie is just amazing such as The Godfather 2.
10,The greatest...,"Before seeing Godfather for the first time I had never seen a serious movie like that. I was only 13 and my tastes haden't quite matured yet. Since then, I've developed a great love for the movies. The Godfather has led me to such classics as Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and many more. But Godfather, in my eyes, is the best of them all."
8,Greatest Gangster Movie,"One of Hollywood's greatest Gangster movie, critically acclaimed and commercially successful. A Classic !!! they tried making movies like it but they could not.

I watched all 3 parts and always recommend it to my friends.

Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay. its a Must watch.

Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic , all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be).

Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success.

Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels)"
10,AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE,"This film has all the elements it takes to make an excellent movie. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, it provides an insight on an Italian mob family in New York: The Corleones. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give incredible performances as Michael Corleone and Don Vito Corleone. Keeping you at the edge of your seat throughout, it's probably the best movie I've ever seen."
10,"For me, big deal","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10. Love it really love"
10,Francis Ford Coppola has made us an offer we can not refuse,"Well where can I start it was just fantastic from start to finish. The mix of innocent Michael getting mixed up. I was just gripped by this. All the actors in this movie are top notch and especially with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in it. Also the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton who have made a real name for themselves a real name from this movie. I could not get enough of Michael Corleone, that icy character that hardly lost his temper, and never would let you know what he was thinking, really gripped into watching this movie over and over again.my hat comes off to Francis and his team they have made a true masterpiece that is THE GODFATHER. I really do reccomend this movie to anybody who knows good film."

10,Why this is the best Mafia movie ever,"Coppola's intense films are the stuff of legend and the sweeping drama of the Corleone family that was begun in this film is no exception. The script is well written by Coppola and Puzo, who wrote the book, the acting is superb, and the little things like the lighting and the music add to the intensity and the drama of this film. Al Pacino in pretty much his first role is superb as the straight war hero son of the Corleone Family who gets drawn into the ""business"" when his father is attacked. Brando and Caan as well as Robert Duvall also deliver great performances. The scene that sticks with you like the Baptism when Michael is having his enemies killed and its flashing back and forth between murders and the Catholic Baptism in Latin owing to the pre Vatican II setting is superb. An excellent film well deserving of being ranked 3rd all time by the AFI. The lighting is a superbly done job of being dark but light illuminating certain things much like a painting from the Dutch Master Rembrandt. All due respect to Blake Edwards but this movie is a ""10"""
10,Awesome Movie!,"Lets talks about the godfather. Now i know what everyone is thinking, 27 nominations and 23 was won. Very accomplished movie to say the least but that's not what makes it a great movie. What makes it a great movie is that it is timeless! It exceeds every expectation that was brought upon it. Now i know about 90 percent of IMDb users will say "" of course it's a great, what is there not to like about it. Well this movie does have a few flaws, not a lot but a few! But overall a fantastic piece of art. I've always wanted to create a movie that was visual as much as the godfather was or is. It really jumped Hollywood into a new era where mob movies were a thing and you could totally take risk with your story development and other things as well. I think it's fair to say that this movie has probably inspired a lot of directors in the film industry or better known as ""Hollywood"". I'm not a screen writer so don't get on me to bad for my spelling at times in this review."
8,One of the best crime movie,"Recently I have watched this movie. My friends were always forcing me to watch this and It's all worth watching. Good one. Always enjoyed such movies with mystery and great dialogues which last for ever.

9,Impressed deeply,"I was deeply impressed by two places in this film, one was cold revenge, and the other was warm affection. I always dreamed that when I was about to age, I could have the supreme right to speak like Godfather Corleone. I also dreamed of having a happy family and having fun."
10,The best film of all time,"Amazing film it is faultless. Brilliantly cast, great story, beautiful soundtrack I can't praise the film enough. A must see!"
8,"""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.""","There is a reason why this movie is so highly rated: It truly is a work of art. I consider this a cinematic masterpiece. Is it long? Yes. Is that necessary to fully tell this story? Absolutely. Everyone brings their A-game and that's what makes it feel so real. The score is beautifully done and made me want to open a bottle of wine to enjoy while watching this movie. I don't want this to be a spoiler review so I won't talk about character arcs, but the ones that do happen are so good. A must watch for any cinephile out there."
10,very nice,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews."

10,beatspice review,"Very nice movie, i love it and will like to be updated when there is more movie by the artist."
10,Wow. Just wow. Possibly the best film of all time.,"I grew up seeing occasional glimpses of this movie on tv. I thought it seemed interesting. I loved the opening wedding scene and I strongly remember the scene where Apollonia is killed.

Sat through it tonight since it' son Netflix and it's AMAZING. It has everything. Romance, drama, terror, suspense, and even the occasional slight sense of humor. This is a powerful film.

Most people strongly respect the Corleone family. Their values are very simple. Family over everything. Loyalty is the number one value. Avenge those of your family who were unfairly murdered.

If only the real Mafia kept to these real values. It would be a better world today."
10,the best,"Everyone should see this movie once in life, it has every things in it"
10,Masterpiece,"Best movie i've ever seen, Since the first time i seen it was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. literally this movie change my perspective & i became a person who appreciate Movies"
10,One of the best and most memorable film experiences.,"The Godfather is without a doubt, one of cinema's most adored pieces of celluloid in history and is loved by universally everyone. Without question, it is indeed fantastic in every sense of the word and with this one, it may be completely justified to believe all the hype.

The story centers on a young Al Pacino as the youngest son of an Italian-American mafia family headed by the great Marlon Brando in arguably his most iconic role. As things take a nasty turn for the family in relation to other competing mafia families, Michael (Al Pacino) gradually plummets his way into the dark and unforgiving world of crime. While the film is an adaptation of the book by the same name written by Mario Puzo, rest assured this picture has a flare entirely of its own. Thanks for Francis Ford Coppola, we're treated to a perfectly crafted story with incredible characters, breathtaking performances, and beautiful story-telling.

First thing to note about the performances: every member of this fully-loaded cast of talent is on top of their game and if you've seen any of these actors at the peak of their powers, prepare to see it all at once. What makes the atmosphere so immersive besides brilliant performing is also an iconic musical score that you'll remember for years. Much like the bleak yet humanizing tone of the film, the score portrays a somber and harrowing theme of crime, revenge, murder, yet contrasted with very human emotions like regret, grief, and genuine sorrow.

The Godfather has also become famous for it's unique cinematography provided by Gordon Willis. Every shot feels like a beautiful and dark painting that speaks volumes to the characters and their tragic journeys to the point of no return.

Cinematically, The Godfather is outstanding and quite frankly, perfect. Any gripes with the film would find some minor plot details that felt irrelevant to the story or any major character arcs. Minor flaws aside, this film is truly one of the greatest movies ever made and personally the most memorable modern tragedy. It's one everyone should see no matter who you are because it's an unforgettable experience."
10,Truly awesome movie,"This movie is so epic. One of the best movies in the universe, that's for sure, worth watching for everyone. The actors are great, casting is great and plot blows your mind. Unbelievable experience. It's amazing that 40 years later it still holds up. It brings out different emotions. And Al Pacino is a wonderful actor. The Godfather is fantastic from start to finish, there isn't a single second that felt off to me. It runs for almost 3 whole hours, and each second is utter perfection. It's a testament to the strength of the screenplay when you can sit in one spot and watch the film for twice the length of most feature films and be totally riveted and enthralled the whole time. This is a long, long movie, but not a single instant is wasted."
9,This movie has changed my perception towards films,One of the finest movie I have ever seen. I love all the chartectors and there presentation. Cinematography is too good.
10,One of the BEST Films ever made!,"Acting 10/10 Plot 10/10 Cinematography 10/10 Overall 10/10

Godfather films are considered to be the greatest movies ever made, which a lot of film directors even used it as their reference in making films related to mobs and mafia. Truly this movie and its successors are recommended to watch."
10,"1972 was the year it was released and till this day it has remained it's strength, it's magic, it's glory and doom. No need to review it, this is just one long tribute","2 word advice: watch it. Just watch it.

The rest of this review isnt a review, it is a tribute to one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. And I have seen it many many times by now and it still stands strong to this very day.

Choose the restored version if you can. It has 4K images, beautiful picture quality! However great a classic this movie might be, the original movie wasnt preserved very well at all. Yes, it seems astounding to hear that such a great classic wasnt preserved with care by the filmstudio or the director himself, but when they wanted to restore the picture they literally had to search over the whole world to find parts of the original copies of this movie that were in good enough state to be used for the restoration version in 4K.

The photographer of The Godfather was Gordon Willis, famously called ""The master of Darkness"" ever since he made this classic, because of his extraordinary use of low lighting techiques with very deep colors of black and dark. Especially the opening scenes with Marlon Brando are masterful.

2 more things I want to mention which just mesmirise me time and again when I watch it. First, those eyes of Al Pacino. Those killershark eyes. Never before or after have I ever seen Al Pacino look so psychopatically stonecold as in The Godfather. Ofcourse Marlon Brando gets lauded for his excellent performance, but Brando oozes sympahty with his kind looks. Al Pacino just is a killer personified. It freaks me out again and again, he has become the ultimate personification of the ruthless businesslike killer mentality of the mob.

Last but not least, I wanna applaud the soundtrack, that mesmirising soundtrack. Anybody knows it. I have heard it a zillion times and it gives me goosebumps time and again. Not of this earth, so beautiful. And that can be said as well of this entire magnificent classic: unprecedented power and beauty. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!"
10,Best movie ever !!!!!!!,"The best movie ever, and if you're reading do not agree with it, you have bad taste. Of course you can not agree with me, but you have to admit it's a really good movie. The film has a fantastic story, with good characters, good soundtrack and good director. Highly recommend. A movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives."
10,Not just a mafia/crime movie,"It's one of the unique movies. It's not just a crime, mafia movie but it has lots of emotional moments as well. And for me it portrays the love in a family so good. And musics in this movie are just wonderful. I have the soundtracks in my phone and I love to listen them."
8,Full On entertaintment,Full On entertainment. You may have seen better mafia movies but this is the all time best ones. Sit back and watch it in a good quality
10,alex,"This film attracts a world-wide, almost cult-like following, with its depth, design and artistic boldness that has shined from the moment of its release, right through to present day. I will review the film from a particular angle: The broad-way slide to destruction.

""Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."" -Romans 6:12.""The Godfather"" Part I is beautifully directed and methodically scripted. The antithesis of its gentle filming approach weaved in the explosive and gripping content, is the head of the hammer that hit 70's cinema hard. Is nice."
10,Untouchable!!!,"Hello.

The Godfather is by far the greatest film I have ever seen! This is a truly unique film, and even after decades of attempts, nobody has come close to making a film like this, and will fail to do so because of its rawness and authenticity. There are many films which may just about come close to its entertainment, but not many that add up to its power, emotion, schooling, and culture. I cannot think of one element missing in this film. Extraordinary!

Thank you very much,

Afollabi El-Sheikh Al Noor Mohammed"
10,May be the greatest movie ever made,"I'm personally not that into gangster or mafia movies, I'm one of the rare people you will meet to tell you that Goodfellas is kinda overrated, and far from Scorsese's best film. There are however a few exceptions to that, and on the very top of that list, is Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.

This movie is pretty much flawless. The cinematography is fantastic, the music is beautiful and fits with the italian mafia theme perfectly, the performances from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in particular are among the greatest ever captured on film, and the film received 9 Academy Award nominations with 3 wins, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Brando.

10/10 across the board for me, and may be the undisputedly greatest film of all time."
8,very good but not the best movie of all time,"I finally got around to seeing this movie. I highly recommend it for reasons I'm sure the many other reviewers have already voiced. In particular, Marlon Brando gives one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen.

On the other hand, it didn't quite live up to the billing as best picture of all time and was not flawless as many claim it to be... I had two major problems with the Godfather. First, even thought the movie is three hours long I felt that the character of Michael was still underdeveloped. Michael's ""transformation"" is the focal point of the movie, yet we see almost nothing of him in the first third of the movie and we can't really tell how much of an internal change he makes. Leaving a little mystery and leaving things up to interpretation is fine but I thought this was a bit extreme.

Second, the female characters were one-dimensional, naive and passive to the point of incredulity. Take for example the scene between Michael and Kay after Michael returns from his absence -- oh come on!

Despite these qualms, it was still very enjoyable and something that everyone should probably watch at least once. My rating: 8.5 out of 10"
10,"Behold the majestic tale of ""The Godfather""","In the realm of cinematic brilliance, a masterpiece emerges, Where power, loyalty, and darkness intertwine.

Behold the majestic tale of ""The Godfather,"" A magnum opus that transcends all time.

Enveloped in shadows, a saga of crime unfurls, In the heart of New York, a kingdom is built.

Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone commands with might, His voice a whisper, yet his presence absolute.

Al Pacino, a revelation as Michael Corleone, A transformation from innocence to ruthless heir.

The fire within, ignited by destiny's cruel hand, Unleashing a performance that captivates and ensnares.

Francis Ford Coppola's directorial genius unfolds, Scenes painted with emotion, each frame a work of art.

A symphony of violence, betrayal, and family ties, Weaving a narrative that pierces the depths of the heart.

The ensemble cast, a constellation of talent, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton shine bright.

Their performances, like constellations in the night sky, Guiding us through this cinematic odyssey, with every nuanced delight.

In the realm of ""The Godfather,"" emotions ignite, Love and loyalty entangled with treachery and strife.

A tale that delves into the human soul's darkest depths, Where choices are made, shaping destinies and lives.

Immerse yourself in this tapestry of brilliance, Let the haunting score, composed by Nino Rota, guide your soul.

""The Godfather"" transcends mere cinema, It's a testament to the power of storytelling's eternal role."
9,World of Crime,An Amazing coverage of the Italian mafia Respect for the great cast Worth watching
10,Just wow,One of the great American Classics. Expresses what family is all about. Well thought out and ambitious. Each scene is amazing and filled with drama.
10,A film that everyone needs to see!,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Do not miss this film!"
8,Next,"I love the concept and headline for this , it was a great background and plot"
9,Excellent film,All time favorite movie. Acting is jabardast. Direction is Jabardast. Oscar award winning movie. I recommend to everyone to see the movie. Everyone justified their role. All the dramatic scene is perfect.
10,The Classic Masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a timeless classic in the world of cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, the film is widely considered as one of the greatest films of all time. The story follows the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia family in New York, as they navigate through the treacherous waters of organized crime. The film boasts an all-star cast, with Marlon Brando delivering a career-defining performance as the head of the family, Vito Corleone. The film is not just a gangster movie, but a timeless tale of family, loyalty, and the price of power. The cinematography, the musical score, and the screenplay are all masterful, elevating the film to a level of artistry. Whether you are a fan of the genre or not, ""The Godfather"" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema."
10,classic,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
10,best movie ever!,This is number one movie in the world! this should be top of 250!
10,I Love it,"The Godfather is a classic and easily one of the best crime films ever released. It boasts a colorful host of characters, amazing plot twists within its sprawling storyline and impressive cinematography. The movie is a true epic that can stand the test of time. The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job.

The Guardian's review states that The Godfather is a brutal sweep of magnificent storytelling. The original will always have the edge in its simplicity, clarity and brutal power."
10,A masterpiece of a movie,"Godfather is one of the best movies i've ever seen, the plot in the movie is perfect and the story thrilling and fantastic. The actors perform extraordinary good and there isn't one bad thing about the movie. It is totally worth seeing and is a experience just to watch, when i saw i was left with a feeling of some of the best spend time in my life, the movie is earned 10 stars and has deserved a place on the top 250, and it's well deserved that the movie is placed at the 2nd place, because this masterpiece of a movie is one of the best movies ever made and because the actor play the roles and perform flawless. I will advise everyone who haven't seen it yet just to go home sit on the crouch and watch it, because this is a fantastic movie!!!"
8,A great Brando movie,I watched the movie many times and each time find something new.
9,Science fiction,"Science fiction has been used as an indication of what the future may hold. At times, it was promising a utopian future, where scientific inventions and developments will make life so much better for ""humans"", and machines (robots or, more generally, artificial intelligence) will be doing all the hard work. In other cases, however, it held a dystopian future, a warning message: technology can, and will, go wrong, and it will backfire, making our future full of destruction and agony."
10,The Godfather (1972),"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that redefined the crime genre and set new standards in filmmaking. Based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the film intricately weaves a tale of power, loyalty, and betrayal within a Mafia family.

The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, delivers memorable performances that contribute to the film's lasting impact.

Timeless Themes

10,EveryGreen,"A Golden Era movie. Have been a die-hard fan of the entire series... There has been a little i can add to the reviews. Have seen many superb movies, but this is one is surely the every green Golden era movies. It keeps you connected."
10,One of the Best of All-Time,"I'll keep it short because it's all been said at one point or another. Without a doubt, The Godfather is one of the best of all-time. Its a rarity when a film is firing on all cylinders; from story, cast, cinematography, editing, directing, etc. Francis Ford Coppolla gives us such a beautifully crafted story that its easy to miss some of the wonderfully subtitle (yet so grand) acting going on within it. Marlon Brando is something to behold as he plays one of the most iconic characters in film history. A man responsible for such terrible things, and yet you're rooting for him in almost every scene. The way he pushes his character to the brink of madness in the most subtle of ways should be a textbook for future actors. For anyone that is a fan of the ""gangster"" film genre its a must-see. If one can't appreciate the content of the story, one has to admire how the story is presented."
10,Truly a masterpiece,This is the only movie i come back to watch again and again. Defines the word masterclass for me. Gem of a film. It becomes the bar to compare other films to.
9,I finally saw the whole thing! Great movie!,"It took me a while to get this movie watched from beginning to end, as it seems I would always catch it a half hour or so in. I'd never want to watch a movie that's supposed to be as great as this after missing the first ½ hour. Then there were the times I'd catch it on HBO, TMC or Showtime late at night and fall asleep (admit it, it does get off to a slow star). Finally i stole my brother's set of all three Godfather movies and watched front to back.

Damn good cast. I liked Marlon Brando a lot and Al Pacino is already one of my favorite actors ('Scarface' I still like better than Godfather). Then you got your James Caan and Robert Duvall was at his best.

Cool story about family and gangster life, loved the horse's head.

9/10"
10,Masterpieces of cinema,This is a movie that went down in history as a classic. I think that one of the problems that period cinema has is to overcome time and stay current in a decade where the cinema bombards us with shocking images created by computer. The films that survive despite not having these resources are masterpieces and The Godfather is undoubtedly one of these masterpieces of cinema.
10,Above any comparison,"Strangling in between the golden age of hollywood and new hollywood , a watershed moment in cinematic history . Watch this to truly know what "" film "" is . And watch it if you like paintings , as every frame in the movie is like a painting . And watch it countless times for countless reasons ."
10,Great,"One of the best movies i have ever watched.



Sorry, your review is too short."
8,Hak etmiyor.,"In my eyes, the fact that a film with such fame and reputation should have a very good atmosphere, the feeling and taste it leaves, it can pass us as 'Goodfellas', 'Once Upon a Time in America' does not make this movie different from them."
10,A Masterpiece,"I don't think any other film can beat God father in any aspect,"
9,"Very good, but not #1.","Like Citizen Kane, the Godfather is extremely influential, but more than a bit overrated. Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather.

Having said that, this cast (Fred Roos is the greatest casting director ever) and crew might be the best group of talent ever assembled for one film. They went on to make some of the greatest films of their generation both in front of, and behind the camera. If you don't believe me, just check their individual credits."
10,Mezu O.,MASTERPIECE. BEST MOVIE EVER. IM RATED 10 FOR TOP 1.
10,Best movie ever!!,"In my opinion, this is definitely the greatest movie ever made!"
9,Father of all gangster movies.,"A great and most loved gangster movie. Godfather is a very simply made movie with full of crime elements going on in it , concern about family , royalty and fate - mixed with very expensive and classy production putted brutally in front of us is the best thing I've ever seen in my life. No doubt Francis Ford Coppola is best in making crime dramas and actors like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as two crime gods ,just❣❣👌. Every single scene of this film is like inspiration and self cautioning.

If you haven't watched it yet then what are you waiting for . It's pure entertainment and a perfect cinema .

Inspiring, strong acting, wonderful direction, full of political elements and events in the name of business, thought provoking and an adorable chemistry between a son and a father ."
10,One if the best film ever.,"I'n not the great critic, I'm just a person, who loves cinema. If you are like me, you must watch this film. All features in it are on their place. Firstly, the story is based on Mario Puso's book, I really recommend to read it, and this film used almost all book, expect the storyline about young Vito (director used it in sequel). Secondly, all actors did the amazing performance: Brando, Al Pachino, Duvall and others created great film. Thirdly, music and costumes made the atmosphere of late 40s. So, it's really one of the greatest film ever. So,"
10,This is my favorite movie,"I have seen the electricity many times and let people around me watch it several times. I'm glad to see this kind of movie. For some reasons, this movie will not be shown in China. Of course, he is older than me. However, it doesn't prevent me from seeing it and loving it.

Mike's steady personality gradually became similar to his father's, even more powerful than his father, and became the supporter of the family. Especially the arrangement of the plot and the contrast of the atmosphere make people admire it very much. Especially when Mike killed the director, the sound of the train was so immersive. My English is not very good, so writing comments is not very smooth. However, I like Al Pacino very much. I also like Godfather 2 as much as I like Quentin Tarantino. However, my favorite movie is undoubtedly Godfather in my heart."
10,Greatest Film of All,"God Father 1,2,3 is the one of the best trilogy film. I watched it more than ten times. Every time watch this film I learn new things. This film gives me cinematic feeling, love to the film, gives me power to create new film. Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro are the greatest actors of all. They all two complete the film. The music, the motion, the cinematography, the dialogues no words to explain, no words to compare. God Father 1,2,3 became the legend in world cinema history. As a young generation film director I am much to learn from this trilogy. It always inspired my heart. I memorized every scene, every shot, almost every dialogues."
10,Godfather has it all that you need!,"The masterpiece can be awarded the greatest creation of the 70s. The movie which is the reflection of the mesmerizing collection of Mario Puzo's trilogy. It has aptly presented the Italian refugee community at that time fighting for their existence and identity in America and the real darkness of the 'Cosa Nostra'. Other than that it also shows what a man can do to protect his family. The desperate measure, the fearlessness and the bold characters can be truly inspiring. The ambience it creates cannot be expressed in words."
10,like,Marlon Brando the genius of an acter awesome prformance.
10,An inspiring and real world concept,"After watching this movie I lived for the same for some days 😁 what a story what a act, amazing mafia kind goosebumps."
10,The Pinnacke Of Flawless Films!,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."
10,The Best,Simply the best acting... cinematography by the great Gordon Willis.
9,Damn Good,"To be honest, I approached this film with an air of apprehension after being told by everyone that it was a masterpiece. I didn't want to like it at all, and the fact that i ended up loving it is a testament to the director.

The movie was incredible. Seriously. Marlon Brando was stunning and Al Pacino an inspiration. The nature of their performances should send this film into the history books, as well as those of James Caan and Diane Keaton. From an actor's POV, splendid, and the plot kept me hooked for the majority.

Key word: MAJORITY, as good as it was, I didn't pay complete attention for the whole thing. That aside, incredible movie. The genre has been done better recently in American Gangster and The Departed (Scorsese, legend, and as good a director as Francis Ford Coppola) but this is a true testament to American and Italian cinema. If you don't watch it, you're a closed minded idiot. No offence lol."
10,Amazing movie,"First of all, The Godfather laid the foundation for what real movie gangsters should look like: respectable, but at the same time cruel people who only care about themselves, their family and their subordinates. This type, more or less, was followed by all subsequent creators: someone, without taking a step to the side, someone tried to move away from the formed image as much as possible, and someone making a great number of references to it, and sometimes repeating frame by frame. However, all subsequent films of the gangster genre have been created with an eye on The Godfather and tried to reach or even surpass its level (which, in the end, the sequel did two years later)."
10,A movie you can't refuse,"I have to say this film comes as close to perfect as any film in modern history. It is just brilliant filmmaking from top to bottom. The film boasts the greatest cast EVER assembled. Marlon Brando(Vito) gives one of the most captivating performances ever seen. Al Pacino(Michael) is just fabulous and mesmerizing to watch. His transformation from beginning to end was movie magic. Robert Duvall(Tom) was superb as always as the surrogate son. And James Caan(Satino) is just perfect in the film and gives life to perhaps my favorite ""character"" in all of films. He just lits up the screen everytime he's on it. And seeing Andy Garcia as his equally hot tempered son in Part III was a joy. The rest of the cast is flawless. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said already. The greatest trilogy ever is without question The Godfather Trilogy. And this was the original. 10/10"
10,Simply amazing.,"The film is simply perfect. This construction of what The Godfather is mainly covers the setting that is located, the characters that are the most charismatic of the trilogy. All this, plus a perfect script by Francis Ford Coppola, leaves us with one of the most emblematic and iconic films of all time. Simply incredible. I also love that a movie dares to be so raw in the aspect of showing blood and how cruel and harsh reality is at times, which generates more credibility What is shown on the screen and what is told in the story. One of my favorite movies of all time. I really love it. Per la Famiglia."
10,good,"Very good.

My first and last review.

Boom boom need more characters."
10,The Godfather,"The first movie of one of the best trilogies of all times. A classic. With outstanding performances from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and an incipient, but extremely talented Al Pacino. The GodFather transports you to the dark world of the Italian Mafia, how they managed their business, their families. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), head of one of the five Italian mafia families, manages to control his business (Alcohol, Game, Women) with his son Sonny (James Caan), his stepson Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and his loyal friend Clemenza. He develops good social relations with the Government, and important business men. When other families want to take advantage of Don Corleone's relations, in order to introduce drugs and deal with them, Don Corleone refuses to share his contacts. A war between families starts with an apparent truce. A must-watch trilogy."
9,The Godfather,"Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be... As for the storytellng, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that carefully crafted. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the desert stone -- devastating humor, definitive conclusion. In scene wedding and songs, Mr. Coppola crafted an enduring, undisputed masterpiece. A great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. Moving chronicles of American life, designed within the limits of popular entertainment. Next year, when enough mans dies it has 31 wins & 31 nominations..!? The incredible language and the childhood room..!?"
10,A History of myself...not the 'Best Movie Ever' anymore,"This movie has a lot of history. I used to describe it as one of the best movies ever. This was when I still was a boy and mafia-movies were so exciting. Don't get me wrong, 'The Godfather' is still an amazing excitement to watch and if I have time I still do watch it. But with this movie it is as it is with so many things in life. Time shows that it is only a thing, or as it is in this case, a movie. Therefore I recommend to anybody who hasn't watched 'The Godfather' already: don't hesitate any longer. Watch it now! It is a beautiful story, great acting, and definitely a movie you won't forget. But for those who have seen this film, maybe many times already...don't discard it, I suppose it has become part of your own history. Enjoy talking about it, love watching it, and don't waste it by naming it the 'Best movie ever'."
10,"The best movie, ever",A true classic. I love the Godfather trilogy. It's #1 on my list and it will stay that way. Al Pacino is so incredible in this movie. I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Michael Corleone as Pacino did. He is such an intense actor...the best actor in my opinion.
10,One of the best Films of all time,"There are many movies that have been made over time that are not that great. This film will forever stand the test of time. Francis Ford Coppola was a genius for his time and make a piece of art the encapsulates the pure beauty of cinema. From the performances to the cinematography and story, this film has it all. I could watch this film a million times over and never get bored. Marlon Brando gives such a good performance in this film in is hard to look away. There is something about his presence. He just captivates that audience in a way only certain actors can. The only this I wish is that I could have the same feeling when I watched it the first time.l."
9,This film has become an instant classic,"This film has become an instant classic and my second favourite film surpassed only by its sequel which is a rare portrait of an American masterpiece and fine art. The cast of Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Cazale, Keaton, Shire, Castellano, Conte, Marley, and Martino are unsurpassed."
8,Groundbreaking,"One of the best mafia based movies of all time, 'The Godfather' is grirty, sad, and clever. The cast carries the story well and executes it beautifully."
9,very good,This film is very good for my wacht film. importantly this film is mafia part
10,The Best adaptation of novel to Movie,"Well the Godfather is really one of the best adaptation of novel to book. I know that there are probably few of the newer viewers of this movie who read the book, but if you first read the book when the book first came out in the 70's and waiting patiently for the movie to be released you weren't disappointed in the movie. I think it is the best gangster movie and if you are fortunate to own the DVD you are in for a treat. There are lots of goodies here.

This is a movie that is just a good story and it makes you feel fo this family."
9,Loooking for something?,"Like gangsta,mafia,and drama? This is for you! Its a great movie and i thing the best movie of mafia at all!

So watch it or i will make you an offer you can't refuse"
10,Masterpiece,"Probably the third best crime/mafia movie ever behind Godfather II and Goodfellas. Still how could you possibly say Al Pacino as Michael is not excellent. What a casting ensemble, Pacino, Brando, DuVall, Caan, Cazale--very hard to top that. 10!!"
9,"Honor, Respect, Family","'Mafia' - whenever the word hits the mind, a bewildering aura or gesture accumulates the thoughts and forces the urgency to create a visualization of certain characteristics. The best possible visual outcome of the definite word 'Mafia' would be 'The Godfather'. From hearing the Italian accent to grasping the tone of underworld organized crime, this movie provides ground for the marvelous portrayal of seemingly oblivious to conceptualize.

Aspects of filming criteria, this movie is a sure criterion. Lucidity of screenplay, exemplary art direction, spontaneous acting, portraits of frame after frame with artistry had made this movie a topmost exemplar in regard of film education. To enlighten the topic, the lucidity of acting deserves far more credit than it can be written in a compact overview. The picturization of Sicilian eccentricity had been executed with a great prowess. When legendary Marlon Brando appears with a simple yet kindling shot, the whole movie sets off to a placid smooth flow. Integration of great Al Pacino from the two distinctive prospectus, one is a must to be edged to the seat while pondering over the transformation of Michael Corleone.

Story line combines us with the explicit overview of Sicilian uprising crime in America. But, what we get from the movie is the greater contradiction of human nature, genuine compulsion for setting higher in the hierarchy and ecstasy of human prudence for family. Along with the lecherous underworld personnel, we get the celestial depiction of a don who is resolute in decisions, morally high in his immoral activities, in total control of the kernel of power with expertise. As the inevitable occurs, the legacy passes and bewilders the framework highly. In spite of possible complexities we get the taste of a single man enthroning the summit. It serves us with the latent ambition of every man to taste the eternity, dignity and complexity.

From the point of any aspect, this movie provides the perfect aura for any audience whether looking for cinematic excellence or compact perfection of intricate plot. From my point of view it deserves a straight 9 out of 10. I have not given 10 because of some redundant cross dissolves."
9,My Review,Its my first time to write a review but i can say with confidence that The Godfather the best movie i have seen ever
10,"Powerful, Stunning, Astonishing, Outstanding, Brilliant, etc.","This movie has some of Hollywood's top performancesand is a classic on every level on filmaking.

Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Diane Keaton star in this brilliant mafia movie about Al Pacino taking over the business when Marlon Brando, playing his father brilliantly, is wounded. Diane Keaton plays his wife and James Cann plays his brother Sonny.

Classic Hollywood films can't and don't get much better than this movie. Deserved every oscar it won plus it's nominations. Oscar winners were Marlon Brando for Best Actor, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture of '72. Nominations include Best Costume Design, Francis Ford Coppola for Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Cann for Best Supporting Actor of '72. Followed by an equally brilliant sequel."
10,The Greatest film ever made? Hell yeah,"Oh my God!

What a absolutely amazing film. I, among millions of others think that it is the greatest motion picture of all time, and it is. (living proof: the IMDb's own top 250 -- you'll see that the godfather is a clear number one

in summary, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic is brilliant!!"
10,Must watch before you die,"Must watch before you die

No words can define this movie."
10,A Masterpiece of Cinematic Brilliance,"""The Godfather"" is an unparalleled classic that stands the test of time. Released in 1972, this epic crime drama, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, showcases exceptional storytelling and a compelling portrayal of power, family, and loyalty. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, creating a character whose presence is both formidable and deeply human. The film's meticulous attention to detail, combined with its haunting score and atmospheric cinematography, makes it a gripping experience from start to finish. ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate and influence audiences worldwide."
10,Most accomplished US film,"This epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day America's  most accomplished feature film. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the storyline's elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time. What makes it so enormously appealing and deeply satisfying is Copolla's masterful direction. Every frame is constructed in such an ingenious manner, that if taken out of context and hung up on a wall as a painting, it would take up another value, becoming as work of art in and of itself. Indeed, it is tempting to compare the dark indoor compositions (the mise-en-scenes' arrangement especially) to Rembrandt and other Dutch masters, without exaggeration. The staging of each scene is handled with the kind of technical and spiritual balance advocated only in Eastern religions: no extreme close-ups, no jittery or stale camera movements. On a visual level, ""The Godfather"" possesses an ethereal beauty regardless of content. The picture's other aspects reveal an astounding proximity to irrefutable perfection: an immortal original score with at least three distinguished motifs; the superlative acting by all of the Corleone Mafia clan and their enemies; the compelling plot which swiftly unfolds before us through, among other things, the most riveting montage since ""Battleship Potemkin"", no less. Even its minute details are widely quoted today: what comes most easily to mind is the shot-by-shot parody of Brando's botched assassination in '99's ""Analyze This"", and the more obscure slang term : ""to pull a Fredo"", coined  in ""Swingers"" (one of the 90's hippest comedies). Just to decipher the later (decidedly dirty) reference should be a good excuse to watch ""The Godfather"" yet again."
8,I love it,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" stands as an enduring masterpiece in the annals of cinematic history. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, this epic crime drama paints a vivid portrait of the Corleone family, New York's most powerful Mafia dynasty.

At its heart, ""The Godfather"" is a tale of power, loyalty, and the inevitable cost of ambition. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of iconic, encapsulating the duality of a ruthless crime lord and a family man guided by an unwavering moral code. Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a calculating heir is a tour de force, mirroring the film's broader themes of legacy and destiny.

Coppola's meticulous direction, complemented by Gordon Willis's evocative cinematography, immerses viewers in a world where honor is as treacherous as betrayal. The film's narrative unfolds with the precision of a chess match, each move fraught with consequence and emotion. Memorable sequences, from the chilling horse-head scene to the haunting baptism juxtaposition, have seared themselves into the collective consciousness of audiences worldwide.

Furthermore, Nino Rota's haunting score lends an operatic grandeur to the film, amplifying its emotional resonance. The impeccable ensemble cast, including Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, delivers performances that are both nuanced and unforgettable.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is more than a crime saga; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends genres. Its enduring appeal lies in its profound exploration of human nature, power dynamics, and the intricate tapestry of familial bonds. A timeless classic that continues to captivate and inspire, ""The Godfather"" remains an indispensable part of film history."
10,OMG Best Ever,"I love this way of mafia for contorles everything. And actualy makes more serieusly and better ideas for doing business.

By the way my review just in this categorys of movies thats all."
10,A Must for anyone who has ever watch any movie...,"Godfather needs no introduction as the name says it all. This movie in fact is godfather to all film makers and movie lovers. Right from the opening scene to the last scene, every scene is perfectly craved to make the movie the most perfect movie of all time and it well deserves all the awards it has got. I found Godfather very boring when I watched it first time as i was little and naive and needed more over do of everything in movies i watch. I watched it again some years later and i found it likable and hence with every re-watching i fell more in love with film and i started to notice the genius in it. The acting, the script, the music, the characters, the story, the screenplay, costumes, art, direction everything is just near perfect. Anyone who lived after 1972 has no chance of missing this magnum opus. We will be eternally grateful to Coppola for this masterpiece. A brave 10 on 10."
10,The Cinema Masterpiece!,The best movie of all time. The acting is amazing and the plot is the best i have ever seen! Coppola is a genius and Brando is the pure image of a great character!
9,Simplesmente inactively,"Esse film é a Ora mas forded De dodos OAS tempos, Chi De gangsters e Tirol pa-papa pie pa pie, tragic, corrupt e o Carol a 4 <3Esse film é a Ora mas forded De dodos OAS tempos, Chi De gangsters e Tirol pa-papa pie pa pie, tragic, corrupt e o Carol a 4 <3Esse film é a Ora mas forded De dodos OAS tempos, Chi De gangsters e Tirol pa-papa pie pa pie, tragic, corrupt e o Carol a 4 <3Esse film é a Ora mas forded De dodos OAS tempos, Chi De gangsters e Tirol pa-papa pie pa pie, tragic, corrupt e o Carol a 4 <3Esse film é a Ora mas forded De dodos OAS tempos, Chi De gangsters e Tirol pa-papa pie pa pie, tragic, corrupt e o Carol a 4 <3Esse film é a Ora mas forded De dodos OAS tempos, Chi De gangsters e Tirol pa-papa pie pa pie, tragic, corrupt e o Carol a 4 <3"
8,Superb,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it."
10,One of teh best movies ever,Great move as previous and next part. The plot of the movie is actual today and can be seen in real life.
10,Legendary!!!,"Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place!!!"
10,Modern Day Cinema Vs. The Godfather,"Wow! Ross And Ronnay in the Sunday papers will have their work cut out for them commenting on this film! It is the greatest film ever, just like Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and Shindlers List, it has mastered its genre, except many people do not know of the film!!! Now days movies such as oceans 11, Layer cake and even police investigative stories try to have the original concept of them film, with the moral battling of crime. The beauty of the story is that it is original and none of the actors (in the first part) were well known, which gives them an better on-screen identity, compared to modern day Hollywood heroes such as brad Pitt, Collin pharrel and Tom Cruise. Even action packed scarface can take The Godfathers title as 'Best Crime/Gangster Film Ever' because that is exactly what godfather is. Its only downfall is the conclusion of the saga, in part number three which is kind off like The Matrix trilogy in a way, The First part had a cult following, number 2 was ""good but will never beat the first"" and the third one was awful! The Godfather = legendary film, which will live long in existence especially with the Italian population! The only deteriorating factor is its lenght not many people can watch a film for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but i could :). Also the plot is tricky to understand for first time viewers!"
10,Unique!,"I will stay away from any spoiler, so all I am going to tell you is: this movie should be mandatory for anyone to see. The story line, the passion, the scary reality of societies within our society... all revealed clear and real.

Brando is amazing. Probably one of his best roles ever. I am obviously new to the movie and saw it for the first time... I am huge fan of Al Pacino and wow this was a very boost to his career. Wow, Diane Keaton, my goodness she is amazing.

If you like the ""mob / mafia"" type of movies and enjoyed The Good Fellas, well this is going to be a top of it all. Enjoy it."
10,Simply the finest film ever made....,"The Godfather has got to be the finest film ever made. It has all the ingredients of a great film. Directing, being Coppola's first major film, he does an astounding job of recreating Mario Puzzo's novel. The acting is top notch, with Brando and Pacino really shining and supported by the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The script is breath taking and really pulls you in to the story.

From the opening scene to the final credits, you just know that the Godfather is special, and it refuses to let you go. The more you watch this film, the more you'll understand the plot and the characters, adding to a already great film. The Godfather has been copied many times, but never beaten. Soon, i'll get the Godfather: Part 2 and watch that, and see if its better, but until then, The Godfather remains No.1 on my top 10 list of all time."
10,The Godfather Review,"""Godfather"" is consider one of the greatest film of all time in my opinion because of the plot, the visuals, the characters and the overall theme of the film. I love the fact that paramount pretty much went against almost everything Francis hand in mind for his vision down the casting. They didn't even agreed with some of the shot and artistic vision he had for his film but and went on to do amazing things, breaking records ad setting new ones. It did great in the box office that year and it went on to become the greatest film of all time. Not only did the film inspired filmmakers like my self but it paved the way for Mafia films in general. Ironically Francis him self became in his own right a godfather in the world of Mafia film. I also enjoyed watching how the characters in the film changed towards the ending of the film. Each character had a transition moment and my favorite was when Michael agreed to join the family business. In doing so he became the don at the end."
10,You need to see this movie,"The best movie ever, the story goes in an elegant way, it doesn't bore you. Also, with the best performances in the history of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando"
10,Great...but not the greatest Gangster movie,"Although this is a great movie, I still think Coppola's sequel ""The Godfather Part II"" is much better."
9,no doubt,"I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one."
10,Genius,"This is one of, if not, the greatest movies ever made. The acting. The story. The cinematography. The costumes. Absolutely nothing disappoints. It boggles my mind how anyone would be disappointed. I just watched this with my 18 year old daughter and she loved it. That's an opinion from someone who has a hard time keeping her eyes off of her phone! Genius!"
10,Endless and professional + lesson for us filmmakers,A movie that is not always fun to watch A mystery every time It can be said that film is not life There is a lesson for us filmmakers.
10,Good,"Any classic is approved over time, and the painting by Francis Ford Coppolys proves its inaccessibility in the genre every decade. Many years passed, and I postponed watching the film in order to ""mature"" for a certain objectivity.

The picture was shot very qualitatively, which gave her the key to success to be relevant in the visual range among other competitors from other directors. There are not so many paintings I have seen with the legend of the past Marlon Brando, however, I am very glad that he received the golden statuette for the best male role in Coppola's film. His role is not as big in screen time as Al Pacino's, for example, but his character's monologues and dialogues can be quoted and quoted.

""The Godfather"" is not only the beginning of the famous criminal saga, it is also the beginning of a stellar time for Al Pacino, no matter how initially this actor did not fit his role, according to the producers, his fame could not pass unnoticed in modern cinema, and the actor cemented the image of a criminal figure forever.

Referring to objectivity, I would call the film ""The Godfather"" a high-quality, benchmark in the genre, and I can understand the surge of criticism and perception of the film several decades ago, which attributed the tape to the rank of cult. But many years later, Francis Ford Coppola's tape suffered a semantic and technical reassessment, at a time when the genre of crime cinema is saturated with high-quality pictures, with no less strong acting."
10,An Opera on Screen,"Along with it's sequel, Godfather II, this movie is what American movies should aspire to. Great acting, great story line. The power of the family, the immigrants' rise to glory, the failures of society, the paradox of religion and violence woven together to form the perfect movie. The characters are composites of real men and women in history. The scenes fictionalize real historical events. The Don's granting wishes to his neighbors remind you of Marranzano's despotic rule in the early 30's. The shooting in the restaurant mirrors Luciano's assassination of Masseria. Moe Green's execution is really Bugsy Segal's. The climax is the night of the Sicilian Vespers. This film is a classic. Puzo's work is wonderful and Coppola's vision is perfect."
10,One of the greatest films of all time,The best mob movie of all time. It teaches you what loyalty is and how to really keep your enemies close.
10,Classic,"10/10 Yeah, I'll admit it. I worship movies like these. Star Wars, Dr. Strangelove, you name it. Performances: A+ Directing: A Filming: A- Writing: A+ Actors: A+ Everything else: A+"
9,"One of an all time American action movies, you'll love it from beginning to end","I was very excited when I bought the DVD package of this movie. Since then I have watched it about four times and each time it teached me something new.

It is one of the most dramatic and spell-binding, all-time action movies.

Al Pacino and Robert DeNero shined like blazing stars.

This movie is titillating, entertaining and engrossing.

You will laugh and cry at all the machinations and plots by the Dons.

You will enjoy watching this movie from the beginning to the end.

And then you will watch it again and again.

I highly recommend it."
10,I rate it 12!!! on a scale of 1 through 10,"Everytime I watch this movie I feel the need to go into my back yard and build a shrine to Francis and Marlon... What the heck can I add to what everyone knows, or should know, about this MASTERPIECE!! I would tell you how many times i've watched it, but you wouldn't believe me...

Easyrider606"
10,Excellent Movie,"Excellent, outstanding for ever... This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well... Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.

Additionally all, ""The Godfather "" is a portrait of its time period and so it goes on all the other works of the trilogy. The film is built upon a significant historical period, shows not only the role of foreign immigrants and their difficulties in building an identity in America as it is also very thorough in addressing how the Italian mafia was organised for several decades in USA. For this and more, "" The Godfather "" is a film which must be seen, a reference that needs to be seen by all those who love movies and want to understand the social development of the United States at the beginning of the last century."
10,Masterpiece,"A masterpiece. The best crime film of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are magnetic, and the supporting cast brings the thunder as well."
10,Simply Flawless,"""Things would have turned out better if we had only listened to the Godfather."" 10 out of 10"
10,Arguably the best,A film that makes people think about life. I'm so glad I watched it before I died.
10,The Movie Name Is Enough,"The first time the first part of the movie was a different feeling of watching such movie with such great concept and actors at to the point with so reality in each and every character, the story lines, the overall climax of the scene was like it's should be a never ending story such was the vision of the story. I wish we could have more parts in the 20s as well...!!!"
10,Perfect,"There is very few films I will give a 10. This is the film that help redesign a new era of filmmaking. It was so influential and so well made that the film is still just as popular today as it was when it was first released 1972. The only other films from the 1970's that I can think that is still gaining huge amount of fans is ""Grease"" and ""Jaws"". Now I might not give those films a 10 but it does show that films from the 1970's set the mold for films and filmmakers.

Now ""The Godfather"" took us inside a mafia family and made us see that they are a ""Real family"" that does illegal things.

In this film Don Corleon is the head of his family and protects his family and his friends. When another ""Family"" wants him to do another type of business he refuses and his family ends up paying the price. The family dynamics change rapidly and not for better.

One of the 10 movies you need to see."
10,Gg,"This is not just movie, it is an emotion. The dialouges are very comfortable the acting level is incomparable."
10,BEST MOVIE ever,"A very strong movie, brilliant actors as incredibly good script, and over the top directing."
10,not so fair,"it is not good as pulp fiction, because this film just shows that an older mafia dies and his son takes control, this type of films are more common,but pulp fiction which is a master piece and narrates an hit mans story with good type of narrating. this film does not deserve to be in 1st place, because they didn't made any effort on acting. it also has many errors on film making.this film was a good movie for those who saw the movie in the olden days, but now the this film has no effect on the viewer, but movies like pulp fiction, the shaw shank redemption are really extraordinary creations of directors. i don't know why it is still stuck in the 1st place."
9,Great Ever made,"Superb Cinema, Love the composition and definition to it .."
10,Deserves all the praise it gets,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Anyone who praises this film, whether it be the acting, directing, editing, score, or anything else that makes a movie a movie is right. It's so absolutely perfect. It's runtime is really hard to feel when almost every single scene is incredibly interesting, and even if a few aren't it's not an enough to matter in my eyes. The performances are some of the greatest I've seen in a long time, if ever. The writing is so good at conveying exactly what it needs to, and the directing is some of the best ever. The story is nothing short of incredible, and seeing it be brought to life with such impeccable filmmaking is nothing short of incredible. There's a reason this is essential watching, and there's a reason that so many praise this film. They're right. What else can I say, it's the Godfather for crying out loud. Absolutely phenomenal."
9,The Godfather,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an undeniable masterpiece that has solidified its place as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, this iconic crime drama weaves a complex and compelling narrative of power, family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of organized crime.

Set in the 1940s, The Godfather takes us into the world of the Corleone family, led by the enigmatic and powerful Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The film follows the transition of power from Vito to his reluctant son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), as he becomes embroiled in the dark underbelly of the mafia.

The Godfather is a masterclass in storytelling, with a screenplay that flawlessly intertwines multiple storylines and characters. The narrative unfolds at a deliberate pace, allowing the audience to become fully immersed in the intricate web of alliances, betrayals, and moral dilemmas that shape the Corleone family's destiny. Every scene is meticulously crafted, drawing us deeper into this world of crime and power struggles.

The performances in The Godfather are nothing short of extraordinary. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, exuding a captivating blend of charisma, vulnerability, and ruthlessness. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, masterfully capturing the character's transformation from an innocent outsider to a formidable force within the mafia. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, deliver equally powerful performances, each bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles.

Coppola's direction is impeccable, showcasing his keen eye for detail and his ability to create an authentic and immersive atmosphere. From the dimly lit interiors of the Corleone family home to the grandeur of their compound, every visual element contributes to the film's rich and evocative ambiance. The cinematography, accompanied by a haunting score by Nino Rota, further enhances the film's dramatic impact, emphasizing the tension and emotional depth of each scene.

Beyond its technical brilliance, The Godfather delves into profound themes that resonate with audiences even decades after its release. It explores the complexities of family dynamics, the allure and consequences of power, and the moral compromises individuals make to protect what they hold dear. The film poses thought-provoking questions about the nature of morality and the blurred lines between good and evil.

The Godfather stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport and engage its audience. Its influence on subsequent films and popular culture cannot be overstated. Coppola's masterpiece is a gripping, emotionally charged exploration of the human condition, propelled by stellar performances, impeccable direction, and a narrative that continues to captivate generations of viewers.

In conclusion, The Godfather remains an unparalleled achievement in filmmaking. It transcends the crime genre, offering a profound examination of power, family, and the human psyche. With its rich characters, intricate storytelling, and timeless themes, this cinematic magnum opus continues to leave an indelible mark on the landscape of cinema, making it an essential watch for all cinephiles."
10,hi,This is a great movie. You won't be disappointed if you watch this movie.
9,All you nutty fans.....take it easy on me!!,"OK, I am 32 and have seen the vast majority of this film several times, particularly when I was younger. I have just bought the DVD boxed set for £20 and watched the 1st film the WHOLE way through for the 1st time.

Oh my god. This film is absolutely brilliant. I always had Casino and Goodfellas as my top 2 gangster films. I am now re-writing my list!! Blown away by the acting, script, cinematography and sheer realism. There are so many scenes that will be used in film study courses for decades to come.

One of my favourites, which some might find surprising is when Vito has the heart attack whilst playing with his grandson. The young boy plays the scene to absolute perfection. Of course, Brando just keeps up what was an excellent performance throughout.

I had memories of this film being quite difficult to follow as a youngster. This may have been in part due to the sometimes muffled voice of Brando, but with the help of subtitles at my dumbest moments(!), the plot and characters are actually fairly easy to keep up with.

Cant really say much more. If you like your gangster style films and need advice on whether to watch....its a no brainer. Its quite a long film so keep the distractions to a minimum and be prepared to take a couple of toilet breaks! I just wish that I wasn't working tomorrow otherwise I'd watch the next one now instead of tomorrow evening!"
9,"A Timeless Masterpiece: ""The Godfather""","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic history, seamlessly blending intricate storytelling with profound character development. From the very first scene, the film immerses viewers into the complex world of the Corleone family, portraying the delicate balance between power, loyalty, and morality. Marlon Brando delivers an unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone, embodying the character's strength and vulnerability with unparalleled nuance. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael to a formidable Don is equally compelling, showcasing his remarkable range as an actor.

The film's screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, masterfully weaves themes of family, honor, and the corrupting influence of power, all set against the backdrop of post-war America. The meticulous attention to detail in the cinematography and score, composed by Nino Rota, enhances the narrative, creating an atmosphere that is both authentic and hauntingly beautiful. Each supporting character, from James Caan's hot-headed Sonny to Robert Duvall's calculating Tom Hagen, adds depth and richness to the story, making the Corleone saga both epic and intimate.

""The Godfather"" is not merely a crime drama; it is a profound exploration of human nature and the complexities of leadership. Its influence extends beyond cinema, shaping the way stories of organized crime are told and appreciated. Decades after its release, the film remains relevant, resonating with audiences through its timeless portrayal of ambition, family ties, and the inevitable consequences of one's choices. Coppola's masterpiece is a testament to the power of exceptional filmmaking, earning its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
10,The Greatest Film Ever Made!,"The Godfather is a true definition of great filmaking. Unbelieveable acting by Marlon Brando, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, and of course Al Pacino. The story itself is unlike any other I have ever seen. Landmark! Simply Landmark! It really invented a new genre of Mafia films. Often copyed never duplicated, except its sequel The Godfather Part II."
9,class,"This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.

10,Godfather. Why it is my favorite movie,"This is my all time favorite movie and when people ask me why it is my favorite movie,always tell them the same reasons. The characters are amazing some of my all time favorite characters Vito Corleone and his son Michael Corleone are some of the most iconic memorable and interesting characters of all time, the acting in this movie is perfect from every cast member even smaller roles are incredible well acted, i still don't understand how Al Pacino never won an Oscar for his role in these movies. The story is incredible, unpredictable unique and interesting, and for a movie over 40 years old, its steal amazing the story arc and feelings of the characters, it as aged incredible well. The director Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job, its incredible well directed."
10,The Godfather... the masterpiece...,"""The Godfather"" is much more than a story about gangsters and based on the novel by Mario Puzo mob. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful in the art of film and endowed with a classical virtuosity inspired, serves up the organization and the intrigues of the crime society to conceive of a true epic about family and about the evolution of family values during the twentieth century. Incidentally, ""The Godfather"" is perhaps the first major cinematic chronicle of the twentieth century on the family's own twentieth century. It is a kind of self-analysis; an exercise that the time has come to prove as extraordinary.Just simple saying... watch the movie... one of the best ever produce..."
10,speechless,"A masterpiece. It's not just a gans movie, beyond of that."
10,I love this types of movies,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say."
9,"Overatted, But Amazing","This movie has been regarded as the best movie of all time, and I watched it for the first time a couple weeks back. I must admit, it is AMAZING AND DESERVES THE LOVE, but it isn't my My Favourite Movie Ever or anything. I don't even think it cracks my Top Ten, but that's not saying it's not a cultural phenomenon.

8.5/10."
9,Film Form Review,"This movie was impeccable. It showed great cinematography, and the acting was superb. The suspense was carried throughout the film with heart beating, wrenching music that matched beautifully with the scene's setting. The character of Don Corleone makes the audience feel less than him due to his superiority he portrays in the film. I highly recommend this movie to everybody, even if you do not enjoy mafia movies. The reason why it did not receive a 10 is due to the duration of the film's storyline. I just felt it ran a little too slow for my taste, but besides that, it is an amazing film comprised with outstanding performances in all film aspects."
10,The Greatest Movie Ever Made... i love it,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film before... but I realized one day when my one of my friend brought DVD's then i saw God father title. And well' we watch them together w/ some other friends and then..

This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).

With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.

It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion."
10,A classic,This movie sets the bar so high that it's nearly unreachable. Legendary timepiece that never gets old
10,Best ever,"The Godfather is an American classic and an iconic film that has stood the test of time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. The story focuses on a powerful mafia family in New York City and their struggles to maintain control over their business empire. The film features some of the best performances in cinema history from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, as well as an excellent supporting cast. The direction is masterful and the film's score is legendary. The Godfather is an unforgettable movie that should be watched and enjoyed by all."
10,"""A Personal Odyssey through 'The Godfather': An Offer I Couldn't Refuse""","""The Godfather,"" directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is not just a film-it's an unparalleled cinematic journey that left an indelible mark on my movie-loving soul. Having finally experienced this epic mafia saga, I find myself compelled to share my personal odyssey through the Corleone family's dark and complex world.

From the moment the film begins, you are transported to a bygone era of power, loyalty, and family, as you're introduced to the enigmatic patriarch, Vito Corleone, played with commanding brilliance by Marlon Brando. His raspy voice, profound wisdom, and mesmerizing presence demand your attention and respect. Brando's performance alone is worth the price of admission.

As the film progresses, we witness the transformation of Michael Corleone, portrayed by Al Pacino in a career-defining role. His evolution from a reluctant outsider to the ruthless heir of the Corleone empire is a character study of Shakespearean proportions. Pacino's subtle yet powerful portrayal takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, and you can't help but empathize with this complex antihero.

The supporting cast is a who's who of talent, with James Caan, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale delivering standout performances that add depth to the family dynamics. Each character feels meticulously crafted, and their interwoven relationships create a rich tapestry of intrigue and tension.

The film's script, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, is a masterclass in storytelling. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, peppered with iconic lines that have become part of the cinematic lexicon. Coppola's direction is flawless, and the pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat, even during moments of quiet tension.

Cinematographer Gordon Willis's use of shadow and light adds a layer of visual sophistication that enhances the film's mood and atmosphere. The haunting score by Nino Rota complements the narrative beautifully, evoking a sense of nostalgia and foreboding.

One of the film's most compelling aspects is its exploration of the blurred line between good and evil, as well as the idea that in a world filled with corruption, power, and betrayal, family remains the most important foundation of all. It's a theme that resonates deeply and invites introspection.

My personal journey through ""The Godfather"" was a captivating one, as I found myself engrossed in the power struggles, moral dilemmas, and intricate relationships of the Corleone clan. The film's iconic moments, such as the horse's head in the bed and the baptism scene, left an indelible imprint on my cinematic memory.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a timeless masterpiece that transcends the crime genre. It's a film that demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate its complexity and nuance. I am grateful for the opportunity to have embarked on this cinematic adventure, and I wholeheartedly agree with its status as one of the greatest films ever made. To those who have yet to experience it, I say: Make an offer to yourself that you can't refuse, and dive into the world of ""The Godfather."" It's a journey you won't soon forget."
10,Greatest Movie of All time,"Very few films of today can compete with The Godfather (1972). This is a must see for all movie buffs, and chances are you've already seen or heard about it. Marlon Brando gives an outstanding Oscar worthy performance, which earned him an Oscar to which he ""refused."" Al Pacino stars and gives stellar acting toward the film, and in my opinion this catapulted his movie career into stardom. Francis Ford Coppola directs phenomenally, and the film is as close to realism as you can get. Everything is tops from: the screenplay, the acting, cinematography, etc. You will not be disappointed; this film will forever stand the test of time."
10,Made me a film buff,"It was very good.At the beginning it seems to be passion of heart and later transfigures into a drama Alfred Hitchcock tried to establish. Suspense and excitement, the old film noir and modern crime.Representing a journey that you will never forget. Mario puzos novel was greatly applied by Brando,Pacino and the whole cast.Likedit sincerely.Motivated me to be a film lover."
10,greatest movie of all time,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema. 10 stars out of 10"

9,The great movie for men,I found character what would be like real men from that movie. If you don't like be a man you'll lose all of yourself.
10,review,"Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. the people that dislike the film is just to blow their own mind, everybody recognizes the complex and beauty of the movie. It has a lot of goofs, although, but that doesn't make the film look silly. the mistakes are stupid, like a wine that doesn't exist on that time and etc. 10/10 is my grade to this movie that will be in our minds forever, because the good wine always taste good"
9,WOW,"This movie is a perfect balance with the drama and old, i love it, really,"
10,Brilliant!,"This is the movie that created the mobster genre. It took mob movies to an entirely new level of depth. Plot, dialogue, intrigue, all top notch to compliment the action. In addition the cast was legendary and all of them were at the top of their game. If you ever thought all mob movies are the same it is because they all copied The Godfather!"
10,''Masterpiece'',I see him every time I have the opportunity. One of those films that lets you live the atmosphere and the action with the actors.
10,Best movie ever!,"Now as this is my favourite movie ever made it is going to be hard for me not to be bias towards this movie and I will try and be as objective as I possibly can.

I'm a huge fan of the first Godfather film and it's story I've read the book, played the game and watched the movie countless times. The story is a great story of a family. That is what the story is basically about the family and how they cope in all these different situations. Now I'm a huge fan of gangster movies and this movie is the best of them.

The movie has some of the best cast of actors I have ever seen in a movie, with actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, John Cazale and many other fantastic actors it would be hard not to make a masterpiece. Each character is exactly as you imagine them to look and act in the book and this movie is one of the few movies where it is actually as good or even better than the book.

The only negative I can find about this movie is that it is abit of an unrealistic take on the Mafia and glorifies them more than what they were. As the movie shows them being very close like a family even the ones that aren't related, but in actual fact it would be best friends killing each other in the mafia as seen in movies such as Goodfellas or Donnie Brasco. But those movies are supposed to be dark and gritty realistic movies. But this movie isn't; it's supposed to be a movie about a family which just so happens to be in the mafia.

I have never met anyone that has not liked this movie and most people put it up there with the best. Which it deserves it is a masterpiece. The acting is terrific, the costume and set design is amazing and the story keeps you interested even when it is just dialogue. These are all the reasons why this movie is my favourite movie ever and why it deserves 10 our of 10 stars!"
10,A Masterpiece Coppola a Genius,"Just watching it for the 100th time. I work in film and met Francis in 1980. My father took me to see this when I was 13. Today, I see things I've never noticed before. A great film is one where you never notice its a movie. In film school I was told filmmaking is a visual medium. The Gordon Willis photography is exceptional. Of course the story is the beginning of a great movie. A great director see beyond the story. Coppola is a master, the best living director, auteur today. I usually don't write reviews but this time I am seeing a perfect production and felt I had to write it down. No one else could have created this magnificent crafted work of art. A must see. BTW, couldn't make this today."
9,the gadfather,"He was helpless, but used his life to make people understand how to learn to face difficulties."
10,A near-perfect film.,"Believe me, for those don't have attention spans, this is a movie that is worth trying to overcome that shortcoming. You won't be disappointed. I was lucky enough to see this recently at the new American Film Institute's Silver Theatre and Cultural Center where I work. Amazing. The DVD set has some great extra features. Also, look for the ""ghostly figure"" of Coppola during the funeral scene. *****/*****"
10,One of the best,"Next to Vertigo, The Godfather is my favorite movie. The feeling of family is well expressed in the film and although Coppola was criticized for ""glorifying the mafia family"", the film does not show that but shows a devotee to his father, and his undieing love for his family. The music is great, the atmospheres are great, and the acting is superb. Marlon Brando is at his best in his Oscar winning role, and Al Pacino delivers a superb performance as one of the most well known characters in movie history. No other person would be able to deliver the character of Michael Corleone better then Al Pacino. This is truly a magnificent picture and not much else can be said about it. See for yourself the splendor of Coppola's Oscar winning family."
9,"There's no better movie in its kind, even in 2021","I think this film is one of the best films ever made and better than most gangster, mafia films which are published in 2010s, and of course of all time. Some people say it is so long and boring but i don't agree with them. I think this one is more non-boring than most 3 hours films. Also it has a so good cinematography that you can call this film an ""art"". Also the dialogues and acting is so good. To sum up, this film is a must-watch masterpiece about mafias and gangsters."
10,"The One Movie That I Ever Took It's Quotes,","The Movies Is a Masterpiece You Could Never Forget, Neither To Not to Be Impressed, The 1st Scene in The Godfather I Impressed Me, The Music Is Still Living With Me Until Today on Every Electronic Device, You Imagine The Family Is Dedicated to a Crime Syndications and Tycoons, But Its Totally About Family, Despite The Occupation of This Family,We'll Never Find a Family That Is Dedicated and Loyal to Each other Like that Family, Al Pacino Was The Reason For The Movie, With The Noble Reason for The Shifting of His Attitude..

10,GodFather is God of all Movies,"What a Master Piece movie. This film can be called as the God of all movies in the world today. Director Francis Ford Coppola work is much appreciated. And the Mario Puzo screenplay is outstanding. The characters design, music and sound is Top-notch.

As the plot begins with Don Vito Corleone declining an offer to join in the narcotics business with notorious drug lord Virgil Sollozzo, which leads to an assassination attempt is awesome.

And the Vito's oldest son Sonny subsequently takes over the family business and he conspires with Michael to strike back for the assassination attempt by having him kill Sollozzo and a corrupt police captain, forcing Michael to go to Sicily in hiding is captivating.

Finally, a world-class master-piece movie!!"

10,The Marionette in Coppola's Hand,"The first part of the unassailable trilogy by Francis Ford Coppola , The Godfather set in the early 1940s follows the life of Don Vito Corleone , the aging patriarch of a crime dynasty who transfers the control of his empire to his reluctant son Michael Corleone. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name by Mario Puzo , The Godfather is one of the only two films based on a Pulitzer prize winning book which went on to win the prestigious Oscar , the other being "" To Kill A Mockingbird"" . When narcotics hits the streets of New York and tension between the five families (Strachi, Cuneo, Barzini, Tattaglia, Corleone) heat up , all of the families wind up supporting Virgil Solozzo to avoid a long destructive war. The film has every odd in its favor as Brando pulls off the performance of a lifetime portraying Vito Corleone, Pacino introduces his innate and instinctive whit and, Coppola's meticulous direction which shapes up into a genre defining timeless classic of the west. While Brando and Coppola walk home with an Academy win each, Pacino wins hearts all over. Released in 1972 and often crowned as the film of the decade, the film however does not appeal to people of all ages. Despite being a timeless classic, the film may at some points come across as very strong and too violent. A deep untwisting plot supported by iconic performances and impeccable direction, the film narrates a story about crime, drama, redemption and an offer you can't refuse. All in all, ' The Godfather' comes out as a benchmark in classic film making and speaks for itself. Even after all the years that have gone by and all the years to come the film continues to elate and appease the viewers, who return the love for the same. "" Watch all the movies you want but remember it is a sin to skip The Godfather """

10,100 words review,"This is one of the best movies of all time. Direction, story, acting, even small things like camera angle and lighting are the best. Every scene of this movie seems to be worked on and executed perfectly. It has been highly rated in all of the movie rating websites and is a must watch for all the moviebuffs.

The story is based on Sicilian Mafia in America and their head Vito Corleone who is a criminal mastermind, works under certain rules strictly to be followed. He is aging and the story covers the transfer of power of his clandestine empire.

Trivia Directed by Francis Ford Cappola Based on a novel of the same name by Legendary crime novel writer Mario Puzo Whenever oranges appear in the film, they foreshadow death Quotes ""My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse."" ""A friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults."" ""Revenge is a dish that tastes best when served cold."""
10,Perfect Film,I have seen this film too many times and I always go back and back and back cuz I love it. loved this
9,Good movie,"I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
10,must watch it,I watch it 2 times.one of the best movie ever. The Director Francis Ford Coppola is done his great job.and Marlon Brando acting is fantastic.
10,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a timeless masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the film is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made. With its unforgettable characters, compelling storytelling, and breathtaking performances, ""The Godfather"" has left an indelible mark on the history of cinema and continues to captivate audiences to this day.

A Tale of Power, Loyalty, and Betrayal:

Set in the tumultuous world of organized crime in New York City, ""The Godfather"" tells the epic story of the Corleone family and their rise to power. At the center of it all is Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by Marlon Brando. Brando's performance as the aging patriarch is nothing short of mesmerizing, earning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. From his iconic raspy voice to his commanding presence, Brando brings depth and complexity to Vito Corleone, a character torn between his love for his family and the violent world he operates in.

Beyond Brando's remarkable portrayal, the film boasts an ensemble cast that delivers outstanding performances. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, who undergoes a transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader. Pacino's restrained intensity perfectly captures Michael's internal struggle and his descent into darkness. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, all deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of depth to their respective characters.

Impeccable Direction and Cinematography:

Francis Ford Coppola's direction in ""The Godfather"" is nothing short of brilliant. The film's pacing is meticulous, allowing the story to unfold gradually, drawing audiences deeper into the Corleone family's world. Coppola's attention to detail is evident in every scene, from the opulent wedding sequence to the tense moments of confrontation. The film's cinematography, beautifully captured by Gordon Willis, creates a dark and atmospheric visual palette that perfectly complements the story's themes of power, loyalty, and betrayal.

Unforgettable Dialogue and Memorable Scenes:

""The Godfather"" is packed with unforgettable dialogue that has become deeply ingrained in popular culture. From Vito Corleone's iconic line, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" to Michael's chilling proclamation, ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business,"" the film is filled with lines that have become synonymous with the gangster genre. These timeless quotes, combined with the film's memorable scenes, such as the horse's head in the bed and the baptism montage, have cemented ""The Godfather"" as a cultural phenomenon.

Impact and Legacy:

""The Godfather"" not only revolutionized the gangster genre but also had a profound impact on filmmaking as a whole. Its influence can be seen in subsequent films and TV shows that explore themes of power, family, and moral ambiguity. The film's success spawned two equally acclaimed sequels, further cementing its status as a cinematic trilogy for the ages. ""The Godfather"" remains an essential viewing experience for cinephiles and a testament to the power of storytelling, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema."
10,Surrogate Father,"As someone who experienced the gritty reality of Brooklyn's ghetto in the 1970s without the guidance of positive male role models, ""The Godfather"" presents a complex and, at times, conflicting narrative.

Firstly, the film's portrayal of organized crime may resonate deeply with individuals from marginalized communities where systemic injustices and limited opportunities prevail. The allure of power, respect, and the ability to control one's circumstances, albeit through illegal means, can seem like a tantalizing escape from poverty and oppression. In this sense, the character of Don Vito Corleone embodies a figure of authority and influence that many may yearn for in the absence of positive role models within their own communities.

However, it is essential to recognize the consequences depicted in ""The Godfather"" are steeped in violence, betrayal, and moral ambiguity. While the Corleone family may command respect and fear, their wealth and power come at a profound cost, often resulting in the loss of loved ones and the perpetuation of a cycle of revenge and bloodshed. For individuals growing up without positive male role models, this portrayal may serve as a cautionary tale, highlighting the destructive nature of pursuing power at any cost.

Furthermore, the film's exploration of family dynamics and loyalty may strike a chord with those who have forged their own sense of kinship and belonging amidst adversity. The notion of ""family"" extends beyond biological ties in many marginalized communities, with individuals forming bonds of loyalty and support with peers and mentors who provide guidance in the absence of traditional familial structures.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to approach ""The Godfather"" with a critical lens, recognizing that its portrayal of organized crime romanticizes a lifestyle fraught with peril and moral compromise. While the film may offer a glimpse into a world of power and influence, it ultimately serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of forsaking one's principles in pursuit of dominance.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" presents a compelling narrative that resonates with individuals who have experienced the challenges of growing up in marginalized communities without positive male role models. While the film may offer a sense of escapism and empowerment, it also serves as a stark reminder of the dangers inherent in pursuing power through illicit means. As such, it prompts reflection on the importance of integrity, compassion, and resilience in the face of adversity."
10,Greatest of ALL,"As far as I'm concerned, there is no other movie that could compete with The Godfather. Having seen it for more than a couple of times, I still find it great. I have read the book for a couple of times and I will read it again after the exams, when I have more time, because it's even better than the movie. I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the movie."

9,The old school respect movie,This movie have its own points that lead to conclusions!
10,A Tale of Power and Betrayal,"What sets The Godfather apart is its ability to humanize its characters and delve into their complex motivations. The film presents a meticulous portrayal of the Corleone family, exploring their dynamics, conflicts, and the moral choices they make. The characters are multi-dimensional, each with their own flaws, desires, and vulnerabilities, making them relatable and intriguing.

Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary. With his gravitas and subtle nuances, Brando commands the screen, effortlessly embodying the power and authority of the character. Al Pacino, in his breakout role as Michael Corleone, delivers a mesmerizing performance, capturing the transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless and calculated leader.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful, creating a rich and immersive world that draws viewers into the story. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the narrative to unfold at a measured pace, building tension and suspense. The cinematography, coupled with a haunting score by Nino Rota, enhances the film's atmosphere and adds to its timeless appeal.

At its core, The Godfather is a profound exploration of the corrupting nature of power and the consequences of one's choices. It delves into themes of loyalty, honor, and the moral ambiguity that arises when individuals are faced with difficult decisions. The film raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of right and wrong, and the lengths people will go to protect their loved ones.

The Godfather's impact extends far beyond its technical brilliance. It has become synonymous with excellence in storytelling and filmmaking. Its richly developed characters, intricate plot, and compelling dialogue have inspired countless filmmakers and influenced the crime genre for decades to come."
10,An absolute masterpiece of the craft,"What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned from people countless times? This film is so beautifully woven and is a perfect example of a flawless film. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't experience this holy grail. I watched it for the first time in cinema due to the 50th anniversary release and was completely subdued in the story the 3 hour runtime went by so fast. Some people say that slow pacing is a drawback but for this film it's the total opposite. The pacing just really lets the audience feel apart of this family and like you are actually there on the dark paths that ensue my favourite example being the end shot of the door closing shutting out Kay and us, leaving you with a feeling of awe, intrigue and frustration as you want to see more of this world Coppola throws you in.

The cinematography is so well done, especially the low key lighting and longer takes in important scenes. The performances are some of the best I've seen. Brando's, Pacinos, Keaton's all superb but Cann's is just so powerful and evocative you can't help but really feel all the emotions and depth he brings to Sonny. My favourite aspect to this film though has got to be Michael's turn from an average distant son to Vito's successor it's just wonderful to watch it happen. The best scene to exemplify this for me is the restaurant scene where a key turning point occurs which acts as a catalyst for the rest of his forceable actions.

To conclude I definitely recommend this film to everyone and is a must watch."
10,O Poderoso Chefão é sem dúvidas o Maior Divisor de Águas do Cinema,O Poderoso Chefão é sem dúvidas o Maior Divisor de Águas do Cinema Americano!
10,It's immoral to rate below 10,"I rate 10 stars for movies that I watch again and again. But if I rate 9 the average will count down, and I can't do that. This movie is great, best than the book, a piece of art, and the favorite of my mom. She can watch it again daily; but I can't, a little long and slow to me in some parts. So, 10 stars deserved; but for my personal taste, 9."
10,La Mejor Pelicula en su Genero,Esta película muestra claramente el valor de la lealtad aun en tiempos difíciles y lo importante que puede ser la familia .
9,A masterpiece movie of all time,The film is amazing and one of the favorite movie of all time.
10,masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt."
10,The greatest crime movie ever made,"I am a huge movie fan and all my friends know that this film is my most favourite. Every performance is superb and every line is a classic. The images are the work of a great cinematic artist and the unforgettable score perfectly frames his work. I have watched this movie many times and look forward to many more viewings. Truly, the greatest crime movie ever made."
9,Amazing timeless movie,"This movie is true art and never get s okd. Perfect illustartion of the Italian underworld in the states with great actors, legendary conversations and good action scenes. On top of that great sountrack."
10,"An offer so good,","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
10,Best movie ever made,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. This epic crime drama delves into the intricate world of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan led by the enigmatic Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).

The film's narrative is both captivating and complex, exploring themes of family, loyalty, power, and corruption. Coppola masterfully balances moments of intense violence with quieter, more intimate scenes, creating a rich and immersive experience.

Brando's performance as Don Vito is a tour de force, delivering a nuanced and unforgettable portrayal of a man who is both feared and respected. Al Pacino's transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless mobster is equally compelling, showcasing his exceptional talent."
10,"Movies, acting, storytelling dont get any better","A superb story, engaging and expertly crafted. The best actors cinema has to offer. Impressive directing moving us through their lives as if we are there. Topped off with one of the best film scores ever created. That is what this movie is, that is what allows us to completely suspend reality for two hours. Movies, films, cinema does not get any better."
10,Seconded best film ever made,"Behind the it's sequel, this film in my opinion is the second best film ever to be made."
10,Best Best Best,"One of the best movies eveeeeer made! I see this film 5 time, I can see it another 10 times. :)"
10,One of the best films ever made.,"Iconic film and great contribution in the world cinema. This was one cinema which has the casting, cinematography, editing and direction on point. You pause on any frame throughout the film you feel something asethic about the frames."
10,masterpiece,"One of the all time greatest , Marlon Brando's acting at its finest , one of the best actors of all time"
10,"Cinematic Masterpiece, obviously.","I was lucky enough to watch this movie in the theaters a few months ago because of its 50th anniversary. At that time it was my second time watching this film, and it just gets better the more you watch it. I literally had goosebumps all over my body when the movie started. I can't just sit for long periods of times and watch something without doing something else, but with the godfather, i always sit still and watch.....great!"
10,Absolutely mesmerising,"I have never watched a film as well produced as this and i find it outrageous that none of the supporting actors nominated for the Oscars in 1973 won the prize. Cabaret sure is a great film and Joel Grey a great actor. But Al Pacino deserved that Oscar. His performance was astonishing, the emotions, the words, the expressions, everything. Though it's not only him. Every single actor in this film has a stupidly great performance, that's why it's as high rated as it is. It's yet to be produced another film every not a single actor has something missing to their performance. Even though it's a classic, many young people choose not to watch it because it's 3 hours long. Silly, in my opinion. We shall create a new generation who'll find admiration in this film. I would give it an 11 star rating if possible."
9,Excelente!,"Actually for lovers of the movies ""Mafiosos"" without a doubt the Godfather ""The GodFather"" is the only movie of all time, if you like the story, drama, suspense and action the godfather without a doubt is the best movie of all time in this category, I recommend it Widely, do not hesitate a second to look for it or rent it, without a doubt ... it will be worth it, enjoy!"
10,A Cinematic Masterpiece: *The Godfather* (1972),"**The Godfather** (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in cinema history. The story centers around the powerful Corleone crime family, led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), as they navigate loyalty, power, and betrayal in the dangerous world of organized crime. As Vito's youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), is reluctantly drawn into the family business, the film examines his transformation from a war hero into a ruthless mafia boss.

The film is a perfect blend of compelling storytelling, complex characters, and iconic performances. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, bringing a quiet yet commanding presence to the role. Al Pacino's nuanced performance as Michael is equally powerful, as his character's journey from innocence to corruption drives much of the film's emotional weight. The supporting cast, including James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, adds further depth.

Coppola's direction is masterful, creating an immersive atmosphere with its deliberate pacing, stunning cinematography, and haunting score by Nino Rota. The film's themes of family, power, and morality resonate on a deeply human level, elevating it beyond a typical crime drama.

**Rating: 10/10** - *The Godfather* is an unparalleled masterpiece that transcends the crime genre, offering a richly layered exploration of power, loyalty, and the dark side of the American Dream. Its impact on cinema is profound, making it a timeless classic."
10,good,"First part 1. Opening music, Italian style, soothing, solemn, with a bit of tragedy. This music is also a musical melody throughout the play. With music, subtitles fade in and out. 2. This opening music laid a solemn and tragedy tone for the whole film.

the second part 1. Bauna Sala's daughter was bullied by her American boyfriend. The law could not give them heavy penalties, so Bauna Sala asked the godfather for help. The godfather refused with respect for himself and friendship, but under the influence, Baunasala yielded and called out the godfather. The godfather agreed. 2. This paragraph is very informative, and Coppola put it at the beginning, which shows its importance. Next, let's analyze the hidden content. First of all, it presents the ideology of the entire American society represented by the American spirit, economy, freedom, and law. At the same time, it also mentions the family culture that Italian culture attaches importance to. The first line is ""I believe in America."" By Buna Sala. The picture is completely black at this time, suggesting the huge darkness under this line. Immediately after ""America made my fortune"", this line is a well-known American dream, and strives to succeed. Next is the American way of raising her daughter, giving her freedom, and also telling her never to be humiliated, of course, the latter is of great importance to Italian culture. The rape of her daughter by an American man reflects the conflict and inequality between Americans and Italian immigrants, and her daughter resisted and suffered violence. The punishment of rapists by US law was suspended for three years and the execution was suspended. The question of law and fairness and justice was thus raised. Is fairness or justice guaranteed by law or by individual violence? The godfather answered, ""Why didn't you come to me first before you call the police?"" The rest is the Godfather's conquest of Buna Sala. It shows the power of the godfather and the value of friendship and respect under the cover of money, which also reflects the ideological confrontation between the United States and Italy. Finally, the arrangement and arrangement of the Godfather on this matter reflected his careful thoughts, and he arranged it to Tom Haggin to explain his status as a military division. Kremensha is also mentioned. 3. Form A Image Styling Gordon Willis's low-key photography complements content narrative. The appearance of Baunasala, the background is almost completely black, and the characters are fully emphasized, and the low-key photography of the entire room shows that the work performed inside is out of sight. The outdoor light comes in through the blinds, and there are two light sources in the room, showing the texture of the objects in the picture, making the whole picture look like an oil painting. The red roses on the clothes of the godfather were as bright as blood. B In terms of scene angle, the long zoom lens at the beginning is perfect. The space in which the character is located and the godfather of the close-up scene gradually show up, but it is still the back and adds suspense. The performance of Baunasala was wonderful. The rest are mostly stable fixed lenses. In terms of character transfer, it is mainly the interaction between the godfather and Baunasala. The two were originally in the same sitting position from a distance. Later, he became a stance of Baunasala. Although the godfather was in a low position, he still controlled the position. The later godfather stood up and had more control. Taking a shoulder shot of Buna Sala was also at an angle of depression, which was completely at a disadvantage. There is a very interesting composition, with the godfather and Baunasala in the foreground, and Santino in the background, showing Santino's learning of the way the godfather deals and his inheritance. The use of the cat is said to be a temporary intention of the director, but it is here to show the grace and calmness of the godfather. Out of color."
10,the best ever,In some where while watching you will understand or may like the gang work
10,Simply the best movie!,"The greatest mafia movie ever. If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death!

If you get past the first hour the movie is highly entertaining with great dialog and great acting. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in American History in my opinion.

Watching the movie the second time made me realize that this is probably one of he greatest movies ever. The character development is excellent and you understand that more upon the second viewing.

In summary, if you haven't seen this movie don't expect to be blown away the first time watching. Let the movie develop and when the movie ends you will want to watch it again from the beginning to understand everything that happened. After that you would be hard pressed to deny this movie as one of the greatest."
9,Masterpiece,"A great movie ever made in cinematic universe!!!

If you are a lover of cinema then you should not miss this work in ever aspect i would say."
10,Amazing,A movie that I can watch a hundred times and not get bored.
9,for me great movie,Awesome movie recomend it to everyone because i think everyone needs to watch it. outstanding filmaking and i will watch it many more times for sure its that good
9,what's a exellent movie !,"The movie teach us how to be a real man.

Cinematographer Gordon Willis earned himself the nickname ""The Prince of Darkness,"" since his sets were so underlit. ""Paramount Pictures"" executives initially thought that the footage was too dark, until persuaded otherwise by Willis and Francis Ford Coppola that it was to emphasize the shadiness of the Corleone family's dealings.

The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly."
8,The Godfather,"Director: Francis Ford Coppola Writers: Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola Actors: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan My Points: 7,8 - 4/5 Well, a very good movie - but not ""that good"".

I'm referring to IMDb's points; 9,2/10 and second best on the ""top rated movies"". I only gave 7,8/10, which is also a good grade - but far away from IMDb's... Marlon ""Don Vito Corleone"" Brandon's ""offer he can't refuse"", very nice classic sentence! The horses head on the bed, I'm speechless how good it was.

The restaurant shooting were nice.

James ""Sonny Corleone"" Caan was nice, when he defended his sister honor, by beating the ""woman (her sister) hitter"".

The ""car shootout"" was nice scene, a definate classic.

It was nice, when Al ""Michael Corleone"" Pacino took over ""the family"". The ending was nice, the door slowly closing... Very nice!"

9,very nice,"The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, the music is soothing and sad, and the interests of the game are conflicting human nature. Whether it is acting or the use of lenses and music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely necessary to sink your heart to taste carefully, and you can have a new feeling whenever you come back and revisit."
10,Masterpiece,The greatest movie ever. I think it deserves 10 out of 10 stars.
9,Subtitles Necessary,"Does ""The Godfather"" live up to the hype? I think that it does. This was my first time watching the #2 rated movie on IMDb and it did not disappoint. The film transports you to the world of organized crime and does so in such an elegant way. I forgot that I was watching a movie and was enveloped in the terrifying underworld of the mafia.

The acting is superb, with one of the strongest casts of all time. Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, every single actor in this film made the characters feel real. These guys all do terrible things, yet you care deeply for them. While everyone else is phenomenal, the star of this film is Al Pacino. He made me so invested in the character of Michael and had a raw vulnerability to him. Starting as the boy who was estranged from the family business to then becoming the ruthless Don Corleone was remarkable to watch.

The movie is long and there are some dry spells. The names of all the different characters can get a bit jumbled, especially without subtitles on the first watch. Both of those are probably just my ignorance, but I am eager for a second watch and to dive into the sequel.

Best Character: Michael Corleone Best Quote: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" - Don Corleone Best Scene: Michael in the Restaurant (Honorable mention to ""Settling All Family Business"") Best Piece of Score: ""The Godfather Finale."
9,Best title ever,I'm support this movie. Ones of the best movie creations of film creating in the past decade.
9,Perfect !!!!!,"Fabulous movie. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
9,An Offer You Can't Refuse,"A masterpiece. An amazing film. Brilliant performances from everyone. The directing of Francis Ford Copolla was unbelievable, the cinematography was flawless, along with the script. Also the original score was very, very good. The film is filled with amazing lines that you can't help but quote.

An enthralling film which grabs you hold and doesn't let you go until an hour after the end, because you think about it for so long afterwards. One of the best films I have ever seen and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Scorsese or anyone with an interest in organized crime. And come on, who doesn't like a bit of organized crime?"
10,AN overall riveting film,This film has become a cult movie has sorts. No wonder people have seen criticizing it because of the attention it gets and complain about its length. I had the same views while i watched it for the first time. But this film grows on you. People who acquire a taste for the art of film will like this film. The way we journey through a man's life is exciting and refreshing. This movie has set a benchmark in every aspect from dialogues which are its main strength to its performances from powerhouses like Al Pacino and Marlin Brando is a treat to watch. Overall if your a fan of crime stories this movie has to be in your bucket list
10,Godfather of world,"It is an absolutely a action packed blockbuster movie. What a movie by ford, evergreen blockbuster movie."
10,Fantastic,One of my favorite movies. I used to watch it all the time. It is and always will be a classic.
10,This movie defined an era,"The Godfather. You just say that name and most people get a picture of Vito or Michael in their head. They can literally see the shady suits and the corrupt deals. This movie defined a generation, people who were kids when it came out wear the badge with honor. I, for one, was not blessed with that gift, but I did grow up with this movie. I convinced my parents to get this movie for me when I was about 12-years old. I sat down and watched it so intently, that for years if someone talked about a scene and didn't say the words just right, I could correct them and tell them down to about the minute where to find that scene in the movie. I would go to Jr. High and talk like I was Vito Corleone, and I'd recruit friends to be in my family. We became a tight bunch because of that fact, so basically, what I'm saying is, The Godfather is responsible for a lot of joy in my life. One of the top 10 greatest movies of all time."
9,Fantastic,"Its for reason one of the best movies ever, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are genius!!! This story is just so good, one of my top rated movies of all time."
10,A lesson in filmmaking,"A lesson in filmmaking, these is easily one of the greatest movie of all time, I whited a hole two years to get the right mode to watch what every body describing as a masterpiece.

and now its one of the best movies i have ever saw ."
10,Most fantastic film,Cinematography is excellent Acting is the most fantastic from brando & pacino Excellent from the others And very excellent from director mr Coppola
10,Um marco na história do cinema,"One of the best films of all time that became a reference in the world.

We see several references and homages to this iconic work in other possible forms of art.

A giant film that opened a giant trilogy.

With Oscar-worthy performances, like Marlon Brando playing Vitor Corleone, giving life to his character who became memorable and memorable in cinema. And like Al Pacino who plays the role of Michael Corleone who continued as the main character in the trilogy films.

The unfolding of the plot captures us in a way that its duration goes unnoticed.

With an incredible production and all its beautiful visuals that portray the era very well.

Anyone who calls themselves a cinephile and has never seen The Godfather is completely mistaken in what they say."
10,classic blockbusters..,Blockbusters starcast and a blockbusters movie..a classic movie you can watch again and again..
9,Crazy High Standard,"Francis Ford Coppola must be a real perfectionist. The Godfather is an extremely artisinal film that can be compared to few others. The acting is unbelievable and the story is super intriguing. It takes the mafia world in a tone of 100 percent seriousness, unlike many other mob movies. The movie is also filled with surprises and loaded with powerful messages. Love it."
8,"The Godfather: An operatic tapestry of power, family, and tragedy","Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece, The Godfather, isn't just a gangster film; it's an epic saga exploring the Corleone family, their rise and fall from grace within the American mafia. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch grappling with succession and a changing world.

Cinematography is masterful, with hauntingly beautiful shots that capture both the grandeur and intimacy of the Corleone world. Nino Rota's score is another standout, its melancholic themes underscoring the film's tragic inevitability.

The Godfather isn't afraid to confront the brutal realities of organized crime, but it also delves into complex themes of loyalty, honor, and family. Coppola masterfully blurs the lines between good and evil, forcing viewers to question their own moral compass.

The film's impact on cinema is undeniable. Its influence can be seen in countless subsequent gangster films and beyond. The Godfather is a timeless classic, a must-watch for anyone who appreciates exceptional filmmaking."
10,My Best all time movie,"""The Godfather"" (1972) is a timeless classic that has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is a masterful epic that explores the inner workings of a powerful Mafia family in New York City. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and follows the aging patriarch of the Corleone family, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), as he tries to maintain his power and protect his family from the various threats that come their way.

What makes ""The Godfather"" so exceptional is its exceptional cast of characters. Each actor brings their own unique charm and charisma to the screen, creating a rich tapestry of personalities that are both fascinating and compelling. Marlon Brando delivers a standout performance as Vito Corleone, delivering one of the most iconic performances in film history. He brings a quiet strength and vulnerability to the role, making him one of the most memorable characters in cinema. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton, are equally impressive, adding depth and nuance to the film.

One of the hallmarks of ""The Godfather"" is its memorable dialogue, which is rich with meaning and nuance. The film's dialogue is often quoted and has become part of popular culture, and it is a testament to the film's power and impact. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is also an integral part of the film's success. The music sets the mood and underscores the film's themes of family, loyalty, and power, making it an unforgettable experience.

The cinematography of ""The Godfather"" is also worthy of praise. The film's visual style is stunning, with richly saturated colors and sweeping vistas that capture the grandeur and majesty of the world of the Corleone family. The film's editing is seamless, moving from scene to scene with a fluid grace that keeps the viewer engaged and invested in the story.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a true masterpiece of filmmaking. It is a film that transcends time and remains as relevant and impactful today as it was over 50 years ago. It is a film that is both a cultural touchstone and a testament to the power of cinema to tell stories that resonate with audiences of all ages. If you haven't seen ""The Godfather"" yet, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it."
9,Great Film,A must watch for all category people. Great start cast with heavy loads of great acting of each and every character.
10,Perfect. As good as movies good,"There isn't anything more to say about the Godfather that hasn't already been said. Words simply cannot describe fully how good this movie is. Has arguably the greatest acting ever, excellent direction, screenplay, storyline, everything is perfect. 10/10 A masterpiece"
9,Truly a classic,"No wonder this is considered a classic. The screenplay was excellent, telling a compelling story and eliminating all the unnecessary scenes in the book. The acting was superb. Marlon Brando as the Don was just as powerful and distinguished as I expected him to be. Michael's transformation from college kid who wanted to steer clear of the family business to a godfather in the making was highly convincing. It's a pity that the version I watched lacked subtitles as I don't understand Italian, but I could still follow the plot. I often find that movies don't do justice to the books on which they are based, so it's great to have found one which does the book great credit."
10,Godfather- Movie Great,"You can't comment that the Godfather is a bad movie if you haven't seen all three. The ""first movie"" is actually the first part of a three movie story. It isn't three separate movies; it's three parts of one story. The third movie sums it all up. If you say you don't like the Godfather, watch the second and third parts and then comment. You cannot intelligently comment on a story that you haven't heard all of.

And if you think the movie is boring, why did the book sell so well? Why has the movie endured for so long? The story must be a good one. If you don't like it, chances are you just don't get it. The movie isn't about a mafia family. It's about the life of one man (Michael Corleone) and his personal struggles with what he has done and what he believes he is forced to do to protect his family."
10,Story is everything,"Great movie, Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour.I'll"
10,The Most Perfect Film of All Time,"What more can be said? Watch this film and see how wonderful it is. Every scene stunningly brilliant, and memorable, from dialogue, to characterization and even down to the smallest detail.

There is nothing that could be said that is wrong about this movie. If you've not seen it yet, you're missing out on the movie that all movies that have been made since it have wanted to be, and could never possibly out do (with the exceptions of Parts II and III).

10 out of 10."
10,Landmark,This is the kind of movie that is essential to watch in your life.
10,Flawless!,"Watched it as a kid, reviewed it later! Masterpiece!"
10,This is cinema.,"This is cinema. Undoubtedly, the best movie ever made. Sorry guys, but this movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is a legacy. Nearly all gangster movies after The Godfather, even from different countries, and different periods, have some references from Coppola's masterpiece. You cannot deny this fact. Mario Puzo's book must be read too. I also recommend everyone to watch the mini series The Offer, which is about The Godfather's production period. It was a pain in the ass, man. Coppola fought to keep Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The studio wanted to make this movie as a modern adaptation. Coppola refused it, too. Thank you, Coppola. For all of these."
10,The Best Gangster Movie Ever!.,"I've watch thiis movie over a hundred times at least, and still it captures me.

It's a timeless epic movie, as simple as that."
8,Amazing movie,The movie so amazing to see man times. This is my one of my favourte movie of that time.

8,The Godfather(1972) IS THE BEST FATHER !!,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.

Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.

2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).

3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.

All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on."
10,Never seen a movie like this before,"Heard a lot about this movie but i was not interested in watching this movie since it is a gangster movie and there would not be much of a story but then i watched the trilogy and was by blown away by the performances and the screenplay,this is truly the greatest gangster movie ever made,that is the reason it is still remembered even after 45 years and this has been adapted by various filmmakers"
10,Masterpiece,"The test of a great movie is that it can be watched over and over. The Godfather matches that criterion in spades.

Made when all the actors could be heard and understood, The background musical accompaniment never took over and the casting from top to bottom was impeccable.

Perfection."
10,Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,"Rating: 9.6 Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best movies ever made' as it is the definition of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppola delivers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from).

Incredible to Brilliant Direction, Great to Incredible Acting (Brilliant from Marlon Brando, Incredible from Al Pacino, Great to Incredible from James Caan, Great to Incredible from Robert Duvall, Great from Diane Keaton, Great from Talia Shire, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Incredible to Brilliant Story (though its storytelling is a bit confusing), Brilliant Screenplay (Mixed with the nuances of subtly and symbolism), Great Score, Incredible Cinematography (uses Sound/Cinematography/Film Editing to really show the mood of the scenes and emotions of the characters), Incredible Sound (see Cinematography), Incredible Editing (See Cinematography), Plot Structure was good and unexpecting (considering I did not expect how the turns of the story went the way they did), Pacing was slow and steady; Runtime was log but it is hard to take out/cut any scenes because each scene feels like it is important to the story, The build to the climax was great with the final moments of the movie being amazing and full of symbolism, The Michael Corleone Story was incredible in showing how an outsider of the family could never escape the life made for him (even though he tried really hard to never be a part of it)"
10,the best movie of all times.,"I have watched it more than six times and every time I watch it I discover that it is more beautiful than before. Every aspect of this movie is really wonderful. I can say it is one of the masterpieces in the history of film making. To me it is the number one movie of all times. Marlon Brando was marvelous. Al Pacino was adorable. James Caan was great. Robert Duval was really great. It is really hard to tell what is missing in this movie. The whole package was really astonishing. I have never imagined a movie will have such an impact on me as well as on many others. I have watched it with my brothers a couple of years ago. You won't believe it if I tell you that every year I go to a movie store and rent it again. I will be doing this for the rest of my life because it is an artistic piece that is worth watching more and more. In conclusion, I would like to say that if Marlon Brando had not been there, this movie would have lost a lot of its glimmering and shimmering light. Al Pacino was also as outstanding as Marlon Brando. The movie is a way beyond criticism. It is a work of art for all generations and at all times. Also the story itself is well-knit that you feel it happened in reality. There are lots of movies out there, but they never measure up to the God Fahter."
9,A Haiku Review,"Some beware oranges We embrace the underworld Which bore film's great fruit

~jodawa."
9,Perfect example of real a cinematic screenplay.,No special effects just a great production and talent.
9,must see!,This movie is a timeless classic. Very interesting facts about the taping of the film as well.
10,Best Thing You Can Watch Ever,"If you didn't watch until now, then watch it. It worths every second."
8,An atypical and unique kind of a gangster film...,"Frankly speaking,it took me multiple viewings in order to really appreciate this movie. But despite my best efforts i am giving it 8 out of 10. Its ending was just poetic and cant be described in words. Brando's character was very solid and manly. I have no personal liking for underworld movies. Probably this is the reason why i am unable to understand its 2nd position on IMDB list. I do believe its a great movie and a very coherent one but not that great i guess. Like shawshank i also think about this that this is an overrated movie and should not be that high on this list.i wont see this movie again."
10,Simply put: The greatest film ever made.,"I know the title ""the greatest film ever made"" is thrown around too loosely, but The Godfather is the one movie that deserves it. It deserves it's place at #1 in the IMDB's top 250.

The depth in The Godfather is phenomenal. Every character has their own problems, their own stories, their own lives. So many times in movies characters lives revolve around the plot, but in The Godfather the plot revolves around the characters.

The acting is perfect. There is so much subtlety in every performance. A single look from Al Pacino expresses so many different emotions. It is a shame he was never rewarded an Oscar for any of the Godfather's. The movies center on him and his flawless performance.

The atmosphere of the movie is also excellent. There is always an air of tension or foreboding. Practically every scene is a classic moment with a classic line.

It is the mafia movie to which all mafia movies are compared, and none of them hold a candle to it. The only mafia movie I would put close to it is Scorsese's Goodfellas.

If there were 11 stars this would be the only movie I would give it to."
10,ALL TIME GREAT,"If you ever had to choose a movie for any positive reason whatsoever, choose this movie. This movie is something that is a guaranteed must see before you die. One of the GOATs."
10,Greatest movie of all time,"When i watched Godfather for first time, i feel something in my heart. The whole movie is just a masterpiece. The emotion, the drama, everything about this movie is something special. This movie gave to you something you don't find in other movies.

Legendary cast.. Marlon Brando which i con sired one of the greatest actor. Al Pacino which also is for me one of the greatest.

Great cinematography, maybe one of the best i've ever seen. Francis Ford Coppola maybe isn't greatest director ever but he deserved so much respect for what he did in this movie.

How i can got over? The script. Easily one of the best scripts in the history. Storyline is very very good. Godfather is one of few movies when are 100 % focused on what happened next. Personally i feel very shocked when i watch this movie for the first time.

For me, there will be no movie like Godfather. Godfather is something you just can't hate. Godfather is the world 8th miracle. Godfather is life. Godfather tells you about life and how you should always love your family.

Maybe not a good review for this movie but i cannot find the right words to describe a perfect movie.

Thank you."
10,"Inspiring, Reinventing, Appreciate","This movie series is a lot inspiring to explain the world we are leaving in. It's Such an inspiration source! Directed as genius Actors where Good, Marlon Brando has his colors as usual it one of my best source of motivation. Thanks for having produce this master piece. Wrote for the knowledge of generations coming. Instructive, also mysterious, the action is closed to reality, just a bit more stunts would be better :), but why change a perfect classic art. This movie is like an old wine that get better from years to years. Someday, my objective is to create a Montreal peace of art like this reminding our society."
10,GOAT,Greatest Movie of All Time! You have to see this movie before you die. You have to see this movie if you are starting out in the acting/directing industry.
10,The Story of Michael Corleone,"Al Pacino has played many great characters in motion pictures, including Serpico, Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Bobby Deerfield, Tony Montana, Frank Slade, Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno, and Jimmy Hoffa. The role for which he will be remembered is Michael Corleone. Pacino carries the entire trilogy, surfacing as the main protagonist in the first film opposite Marlon Brando. Brando got people into the theaters, but Pacino was the reason they kept coming back. Regarded as one of the best films in cinematic history, The Godfather is a classic story about the struggle of immigrants to America and the means one family pursues in order to rise from poverty. In addition to Pacino and Brando, John Cazale delivers an outstanding performance."
9,Absolutely amazing movie!,"This is one of the best movies of all time, for sure. The acting is astonishing, the cast is great and I can't wait to watch it again in the near future. It simply outstanding."
8,Film Liquet on The Godfather,"This criminal drama focuses on a powerful Italian-American mafia family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). After his daughter's wedding he refuses to make a deal with a new drug lord in the area, which leads to him getting shot by a rival family, who is now in a deal with the said drug lord. Following these events, the youngest son of the family (Al Pacino), leaves his civilian status and joins the Mafia, becoming involved in the ever-going family business, made of violence and betrayal.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, the lighting and cinematography are the first things that you notice throughout the film. The use of light and shadows, combined with precise framing makes this film unique, almost like Francis Coppola adopted a different style for this particular film. The menacing sound track makes sure to put the viewers on edge, seemingly making the protagonists even more menacing and scary in the eyes of the audience, as the mafia should be like. Being one of the best performances of Al Pacino, the aesthetic of the film only adds to the dark world of mafia orientated New York.

The film itself is a good illustration of the post-war America in 1945 to 1955, so if you like me, are a sucker for post war America, you'll be pleased by the film's look at the very least.

9,Art imitates life,"This movie had actual mobster families involved in several movie decisions, such as removing ""mafia"" and ""cosa nostra"" from the script, as well as supplying the actors who played Luca Brasi and Johnny Fontane."
10,good as amazing as it is,"The violence is over all, a bit less agressive in this film, and there is definitely much less sex. The language is a bit more harsh, but language happens, and there is probably more language at your middle school or high school than, in this movie. Other than one scene, any teen could watch it. When (don't want to give spoilers) a guy is talking to an old man. he sticks a knife into the guy's belly and moves it up to his neck. It shows tonnes of blood pouring out of his belly and the man leaves the knife in the man's neck. This is why this movie is not for children and definitely deserves a hard r rating."

8,ahhhh!,At first it was kind of boring as it got close to the end it for interesting
10,Will there ever be another movie like The Godfather ???,"Oh my GOD. WOW. Amazing. These were the words that popped up into my mind just as the movie ended. Each word, each dialog, each expression on the faces of the characters, every single bit of the movie was PERFECTION. At one point, i was made to believe that I too was a part of the movie and a living-breathing character. I was so into it. Oh my god it was perfection. Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's acting was nothing less than AWE-INSPIRING. The scene when Al Pacino shoots down 'Solozzo and McCluskey' was terrific. It just transformed Michael's character from a civilized American army-man into a civilized Sicilian-American don, and this journey of transformation was conducted so beautifully in the movie. Another great scene was when Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) expresses his grief to Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) his son over Michael's current profession. He tells Michael as to how he once hoped that Michael would be the one to give the family a taste of Legality, but ended up being the Don who would head the Crime Family of the Corleone's. How he hoped that one day Michael would become a Senator or a Priest. Every actor's performance was supreme. What a fantastic movie. Can't wait for it to be Re-released."
10,a classic masterpiece,"When you haven't watched it yet, you have lost the control of your life. It's a must-see, cause its so good."
10,The Godfather is a classic mafia film.,"The Godfather, with its superb cast, (Brando, Pacino and James Caan) is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Marlon Brando changes his accent from an American to an Italian, which is so amazing. Pacino is great, especially when potraying Michael, who dreams of going to college when he comes back from the army. His dreams are shattered when he has to take over for his father, while Brando is in a hospital. The storyline unfolds from there, and this movie is definetly a classic."
9,Amazing,"Amazing movie, such an inspiring movie for film professionals and film makers, there is a lot we can learn with the film, the directors view is the best part of the film,"
8,Best,"Great classic movie, one of the best in the history and master peice in cinema, Mafia italia"
10,Best movie,"This is by far the best movie ever made, despite being a low budget movie. Almost fifty years after its release there ain't no movie that can describe criminal life in us and at the same time include so much history. Watching this movie is like read a whole library of books."
10,"""One of the Best Films of the Decade.""","The ""Godfather"" is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.

The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.

The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt.

BRANDO

The enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the ""Godfather"" of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in ""On The Waterfront."" He's shockingly effective in a current film, the ""Score."" The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.

THE CAST

However, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the ""Godfather"" nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of ""On The Waterfront"", that was a lie. The ""Godfather"" is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.

I don't have to recommend this film. I give it a 15 out of 10."
9,Pure Brilliance,A cinematic Masterpiece. Every character is incredible and diverse and other movies should strive to be this great.
10,Couldn't refuse this piece of cinema,"Upon my decision to finally sit down and watch this film, I was well aware of some of the cultural influences made by this film. I was aware of, ""Make him an offer he can't refuse"" and, ""I don't get no respect"". I knew of these quotes and was pretty sure they were from this film. Solidified obviously when I watched, but I was also made aware of more quotes and clichés from this film. The horse head in bed, for instance. The voice and manner of Don Vito. So many iconic quotes and lines came from this film that it would be impossible to give it anything lower than a 10 just for that. And now, the film itself. The acting in this film was out of this world. Brando seems to become Don Vito as much as he is himself. Al Pacino is a new world of acting. His way of showing the inner battles Michael faces as he attempts to stay out and stay a good man is beautiful. The decisions he makes obviously affect him in many ways, and Pacino does this representation of conflict and struggles flawlessly. As entertaining and as high-octane as this film was, there was one piece of cinematography that I noticed throughout. This being the lighting of Marlon Brando. Throughout the film, Don Vito goes through a lot, from being the mob boss of New York to being bed-bound. The lighting of his eyes in his office, particularly, is absolutely breathtaking. His entire face is portrayed in this eerie yellow light which allows for some beautiful shots with cigarette smoke as well. But, this yellow light is positioned so perfectly that it darkens his eyes, so they are just black holes of emptiness. It gives the illusion of inhumanity, of heartlessness. Even outside at the wedding, his eyes are still sunken. However, when bed bound, the lighting is right in his eyes, and you can see right into him. This is merely one example of a probable infinite amount of examples of excellent cinematography that you could get from this film. One of my most entertaining watches ever, and somehow Coppola keeps me gripping the edge of my chair for 2 hours. An absolute must watch for any human being breathing air. A classic now, a classic then, and a classic for years and years to come."
10,Great great movie!,Loved this movie! Such a great story line. Highly recommend!
10,Speech lees,A Film for all time. Music for all time. I can watch this film so many times again and still it is like I watch it first time.
10,Spanking!,"After watching this film I finally understood what a good actor really was. Pacino is spectacular and Brando is brilliant, all round excellent film.

The plot works very well and is complex and simple depending on how much depth you want to put in it.

Sadly quite a few people's attitude to the film is negative, they are missing out.

The second godfather is excellent as well but the third is not really worth the effort.

Pacino is worth seeing in most of his films, try Dog Day Afternoon, very good :-P"
10,One of the greatest of all time,"This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line."
9,G.O.A.T,I never saw it like I thought it was a gangster movie. I saw how wrong I was.
9,"unforgettable scenes , legendary","One of the best legendary crime tragedy movie I have ever seen , touching my soul , fabulous acting , unforgettable scenes ."
10,More than a Movie!!!,"Hello there ...

Of course you don't need me to tell you about the impact that Godfather had in movie culture ... unless you are a young person that recently started a serious voyage into the cinema world ,

Prepare yourself to witness some of the greatest actors of all time at their best performances, Marlon Brando's portrayal is iconic , Al Pacino is thrilling and they are surrounded by an astonishing cast , even the smallest part in this movie is portrayed excellent,

Coppola's cinematography is unique , you dive into a world of crime , deception , betrayal , violence but yet it's a movie about family values , the dance between cynical philosophy and romance is something that has never been done in cinema before and if so , not at this level,

This venture is so difficult that needs a master cinematographer to deliver ...and Francis Ford Coppola is one of the Masters ... memorable scenes, classic lines, unforgettable music,

Once you see this movie a bond is created that will never brake, you will come back to see it again and again because each time it will give you a lesson about life , and that is why The Godfather is something more than a movie ..."
10,Absolutely A Masterpiece Movie,This is the movie which is force me to sit continuously till the completion.
10,A perfect movie,"I recently saw this in cinemas for the first time, andi was blown away. Every aspect was just incredible, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography. Its all superb."

10,No other movie can top this masterpiece,"This is the maximum level, to which a cinema can ever reach. Undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made."
10,I've watched the entire series on repeat.,"A great production takes every party on deck.

This was well written, well directed, and beautifully casted. Everything was polished and a little bow placed on top for the finished product. I want nothing more than to curl up on the couch with a glass of wine and bowl of buttery popcorn to watch the entire series all over again.

I am a black woman engaged to an Italian man --- this movie is chef's kiss. The Godfather did an amazing job of capturing the culture and using it to enhance the story. Many filmmakers get lost in trying to capture the culture that they lose the audience or even worse the story. It was easy to fall, easy to fall in love, and even more easy to be on the edge of your seat the entire time. As an actress, this was one of the movies from my childhood that inspired me."
8,one of the review i liked and helpful,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Do not miss this film!"
10,The Epic Classic !!!,"The Best Mob Film To Watch, Michael's Character Is So Inspiring In Various Ways."
10,Absolutely perfect,"This movie is Ford Coppola at his iconic, captivating and world building best. Vito Corleone is such an intriguing and interesting character to see on screen, which is just one of the many reasons that this movie's 2h 57m runtime flies by."
8,Fantastic but long?,Maybe that's because we youth have different brains from people from that age. I enjoyed the movie and it's incredible but there is 30 or 40 minutes that feels like a filler but yeah can't complain about it.
10,An Epic Saga of Power and Transformation,"The Godfather,"" directed by the visionary Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, is a cinematic triumph that continues to astonish and inspire viewers across the globe. Its narrative, grounded in the dark, complex world of the mafia, is a brilliant exploration of power, loyalty, and the inevitable transformation wrought by violence and ambition.

At the heart of this epic story is the Corleone family, led by the formidable Vito Corleone, a role immortalized by Marlon Brando's stellar performance. Brando, with his whispery voice and imposing presence, embodies the essence of the patriarch, earning him an Academy Award. Yet, it is Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, the youngest son who evolves from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader, that stands as the film's dramatic core. This transformation is depicted with such nuance and depth, showcasing Pacino's extraordinary talent.

The film's success is also attributed to its impeccable casting, where each actor, from James Caan's hot-headed Sonny to Robert Duvall's calm consigliere, Tom Hagen, contributes to the rich tapestry of Coppola's world. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, with its dark hues and inventive use of shadows, creates an atmosphere that is both timeless and evocative of the era it portrays.

What sets ""The Godfather"" apart is not just its narrative brilliance or technical mastery, but its profound insights into the human condition. It delves into the complexities of family bonds, the corrupting influence of power, and the tragic consequences of ambition, making it a narrative that resonates across ages and cultures. The film's legacy is further cemented by its significant impact on cinema, influencing countless filmmakers and being recognized as a cornerstone of the crime genre.

With a soundtrack that is hauntingly beautiful, a script that balances epic storytelling with intimate character studies, and a direction that combines boldness with sensitivity, ""The Godfather"" is more than a movie. It is a cultural artifact, a mirror to the paradoxes of the American Dream, and a testament to the power of cinema to explore the depths of our collective psyche.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it is an experience, a masterpiece that transcends the confines of its genre to touch the very essence of artistry and storytelling. To watch it is to be immersed in a world where every frame, every line, and every performance is a brushstroke on a canvas of unparalleled cinematic magnificence."
10,Fantastic and classic movie,"Why is ""The Godfather"" so highly rated? There are several reasons for this. For example, the great writing. The nearly 3-hour film has a great story: the twists and dialogues are nearly perfect.

What can be highlighted is the acting. Almost every actor - bringing out their best - gave an amazing performance. If I had to choose, maybe Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best.

Perhaps you won't be surprised if I say that the direction was also good... very good. Francis Ford Coppola is really a very very great director.

What is also very good is the cinematography. The entire film is beautifully shot - perhaps it couldn't be better.

In summary, a brilliant film that is absolutely worth watching!"
10,One of the Greatest movie of all time,"It's a great movie, realistic and perfect movie of all time. Must watch I recommend it. It's a masterpiece. The acting of a movie is a also very good. If you want to watch movie which is realistic then I recommend it. If you like."
10,the goat,"It's hard to watch this movie and not think about the mass effect it's had on our culture and cinema in general. Incredible story telling, brilliant acting, cinematography out of this world, and a general overall feeling of greatness. I watch this movie at least once a year and don't think there will be another like it."
10,"The term ""mafia"" is never used","Possibly my favorite movie, this is an unsurpassed gangster film and well deserving of the universal praise it received. It scores a 10 in my book, not surprisingly, but I will include what I consider to be some minor flaws. First and foremost, the kindheartedness of Brando's Vito Corleone character is extremely misleading. I don't believe that any mob boss of that era, or even today, possesses anything but heartless greed for money and power. The viewer is left thinking that Vito is warm and gentle and had no choice but to enter the life of crime to support his family--bulls**t! The sequel (another gem) tries to explain this, but I still don't buy it. Also, I don't think James Caan was cast well as the hot-headed Sonny. He looks about as Italian as James Cagney. His acting is superb, but I think someone like Robert DeNiro (who also auditioned for the role!) would have delivered a far more accurate portrayal. On that note, it also struck me that Richard Castellano, who plays Clemenza, could have just as convincingly played the Don as Marlon Brando and, perhaps, saved the producers millions. Brando is, of course, phenomenal, but I think it's important to point out that the less recognized co-stars are comparably as talented. Aside from this, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece not to be missed."
8,Underworld dark site movie,"This is a masterpiece of world cinema.. John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully performances in that character. one of god father for world Don Films. i like very much.

At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot- headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero its really good"
10,Great Movie,Terrific movie making that doesn't get much better.
10,Best mafia flim of all time,"It has everything, fancy, the betrayal of a normal Mafia film but it is better. The ways the story go satisfied, and the end I mean wow. Everything is perfect 💯. Only one thing I don't like that too much character, it hard for me to remember all."
10,great only beaten by part 2,"For me the 2nd best movie ever made. only godfather part 2 beats this, pacino is amazing in this film. the acting by brando is also amazing."
10,Masterpiece,"The movie was so familiar in the beginning the scenes was natural and for a moment you would notice that you watching a video from the cellar of your grandpa pride and the story start to speed up in slow way till the half of it you won't believe that the start was not looks like the middst and the end , the acting and the story line was super class i would say it is the best movie ever."

A crime/ drama movie, set in New York and Siciliy of 1940- 1950.

The movie is authentic, highlights the beauty in Italian-American culture, with the special accents and authentic dialects- Italian-American with Sicilian roots.

An amazing soundtrack, that empathies the environment and vibe of that time, comes and goes at the right moment, to elevate certain scenes and feelings.

Being true to culturist costumes and traditions.

Aside that, the movie explores family conflicts and hierarchic, Brother bonds, father- son bond and romantic bonds."
10,One of the greatest,"I watch this movie like once a year. It's the perfect movie. Great cast and director. Music is historic. Amazing script. The movie has no flaws. I love this film and I love part 2 (part 3 not so much lol)

When you see other movies in the IMDB that are ten, you have to ask yourself, is it as good as the Godfather. Tens should not be given out lightly.

Of course Brando's performance is legendary and this movie put Pacino on the map. You cannot imagine anyone else in those rolls.

I watched the recent TV show about the making of this and it was interesting (not sure how much was exaggerated) but it made me want to watch it yet again.

Then movie a worthy ten. I love this movie."

10,The Most loved Gangster movie growing up,"This movie set's the stage for all gangster movies, the unity in the families in what I called Gangster style love. I could watch this movie over and over again, I only wish to that could recreate a movie like the God father ... I love it Mannnnnn"
10,Pure movie magic,"I watched it a few years ago and I didn't like it, I thought it was ""cool"" but nothing else. I thought it was boring and slow.

I then watched it a few years later, I recommend to watch it in the day or when your not tired, it is sooooo good!!!!!! I agree it's the best film of all time, shawshank coming very close. It may not be my favourite, but I agree it is the best. I prefer watching number 2, but number 1 is amazing."
10,Great movie ever,"This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it.

8,Everything OK,"ased on these parameters, the LMS Filter block computes the filter weights using the normalized LMS equations. The filter order you specified is the same as the filter order of the Digital Filter Design block. The Step size (mu) parameter defines the granularity of the filter update steps.

The block outputs the filter weights from this port."
8,Uncomparable,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
10,An intense epic of loyalty and the cost of betrayal.,"Based on the old style Sicilian mafia, Francis Ford Coppola directs Mario Puzo's novel ""The Godfather"" into the dramatic tale of Sicilian Godfather Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Coppola and Puzo convey the importance of loyalty to the family, the cost of betrayal, and ever-present power of organized crime rings."
9,What else need to be said?,"What can I possibly add to all the comments that have been given? I think the true greatness of this movie lies in the fact that Puzo and Coppola both worked on the script of these movies. Directors often get a book all wrong and screw up the translation from the book to the movie, and that's only logical, because a book is art and that's personal. THe movie would have been completely different if Coppola had written the screenplay on his own without Puzo telling him what the real essence of the story is. And that is what lifted this movie and the other godfathers beyond greatness... I give a 9 out of 10."
10,THE GOD FATHER REVIEWS,"The Godfather is an excellent movie with an excellent story. It is a film depicting the Sicilian mafia in USA as well as Italy itself, and is written by a person with direct Italian ancestry. ... The film had legendary actors like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall to mention a few."
10,Al Pacino Godfather is a must watch!,Well written classic must watch movie!!! Go see it or buy it!
10,A Cinematic Masterpiece Perfection in Every Frame,"I don't just like The Godfather-I love it in every way imaginable. From the hauntingly beautiful score to the flawless performances (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino-unmatched!), every moment is etched into cinema history. The pacing is deliberate yet gripping, the dialogue is sharp and iconic, and the themes of family, loyalty, and power resonate across generations.

Coppola's vision is a masterclass in storytelling, and The Godfather isn't just a movie-it's an experience, an education, a feeling. It's a film that teaches you how art can transcend entertainment and become something timeless.

Every time I watch it, I discover something new: a subtle expression, a hidden meaning, a moment of brilliance that redefines what cinema can be.

To me, The Godfather is not just the best film ever made-it's the gold standard. A 10/10 masterpiece."
10,2nd best of all time....,"It gets a 10 because it deserves a 10. Not as perfect as Rear Window, but better than Lord of the Rings. We'll see if Lord stands the test of time. If we were comparing books....I'd say Lord was better, but because we're comparing movies...Godfather reigns."
10,A classis,"The Godfather is an absolute classic, which is definitely a required watch for anyone looking to create an action thriller. One of my most favourite movies of all times."
9,Love This Movie,"If you can embody the power of ""The Godfather"" you can do anything!"
10,roberto molina,"I think it is a very good movie, it is a very good creation with first-rate actors, it is very good to enjoy one weekend."
10,The best mafia movie in history,"The characters, places and scenes in the movie The Godfather are reflected as if they were real, not a movie. If this wasn't a movie, I would have thought that the actors were not really actors but mafia bosses. The wonderful director Cappola has created not just a movie but a work of art that will be indelible forever. From the moment the movie starts, you feel like you're in a mafia family and witnessing everything. It is also admirable that it has inspired some scenes of many movies and TV series around the world. I bow with respect to all the actors, the production team and everyone who contributed. Thank you Marlon Brando, thank you Alpacino, thank you Cappola and everyone else."
9,A must watch,A must must watch!!! I love this movie and can watch it 100 times.
10,Do Good,"This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld where we are so embedded that we don't even notice it. Coppola places us smack-dab in the center of what is, admittedly, a society created by criminals for criminals. That's also why it's so welcoming. We're surrounded by its inhabitants - cold-blooded killers who see crime as a 9-to-5 job masquerading as respectable men. And I don't mean men. From the outside, we'll only witness the horrific, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought-out actions.

But it goes deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family, led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He's the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for someone like him, who doesn't fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict unless it's absolutely necessary. He's a man defined by moral principles. There's a scene early on where, on the day of his daughter's wedding, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), practices the speech he's going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for both of them, not to mention that I was actually warming up to both of the mobsters. Not to mention that Lenny Montana was a real mob hit-man and was actually nervous as he said this line.

The more I watched, the more I realized how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone it comes into contact with. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding dressed as a war hero with his longtime girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure, and the sheer devilish allure of it draw him in. As we progress through the film, the transformation is dramatic, and every outsider who comes close to him is tainted. One way or another. If they survive, they are drawn in, as are we as viewers.

Inside, Coppola presents the family in its entirety to us with a boldly personal approach, and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is committed simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put in a chair alongside them, so we relate easily. To us, they are the good guys, the rival family the bad guys. The greatest achievement this film has managed to pull off is separating the good guys and the bad guys in a world full of bad guys.

This is a film of unparalleled subtlety. No other film holds its own so well. No other film is done with such precision, attention, and completeness. There are so many layers that I probably missed and may never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing less than a timeless reference movie whose impact is based not on reinventing the wheel, but on making it perfectly optimal.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step forward in the art form, the same things ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" did. ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered because they are so good, and I can't possibly imagine a greater achievement than that."
10,Fantastic,This is one of the best movies ever made. It's simply brilliant with some of the best actors of Hollywood. Watching this is a must. You won't regret it.
10,Absolute Best Movie Ever Made Hands-Down!!!,"You cannot go wrong with this movie if you are a movie-lover! Al Pacino is at his absolute best. Martin Scorsese is Jealous of not have having made this one. Guns, Violence, Family, Drama, Action, Comedy. This movie has it all. Very good lighting in the film - Very Dark and moody, It sets the tone for its unique style. Marlon Brando.

Quotes: I'm Smaaaat! Bring the connoles. Add a little whine and a little sugar. Men are coming to kill my father now can you help me move him to the other room please. Its a sicilian message: It means he sleeps with the fishes. Sonny was loving our idea wasnt he?"
10,Best Crime Story Film,Only one word for this movie and that is OUTCLASS!
10,The Greatest picture in the history of film,"This movie is beyond words. It is motion picture history. I remember the first time i saw it. I was captivated by it's magical realism. I was swept away. What i saw was poetry in motion. At that moment i knew there will never be a movie as perfect as this. All movies should be compared to this. Artistically, technically and emotionally it is simply untouchable."
10,A Timeless Classic,"I read the book first and considered it a literary masterpiece of drama and intrigue.

A year later when I watched the film on a friend's recommendation I was completely mesmerized by the way the characters of book made their presence felt on screen.

It is one of the masterpieces of cinema world over. Many a director worldwide has paid tributes to this film in one way or the other. Twice in the recent history in India only (Sarkar and Raajneeti).

Marlon Brando is amazing as the Godfather. Al Pacino (who was still making a stronghold in Hollywood at that time) has done justice as the son who is in conflict with his family business. His transformation, both by action and his psyche, is a treat to watch.

The beauty of the film, and why it works at so many levels, lies in the fact that the characters' charisma is built not by their actions on screen but by a sense of intrigue that the writers and director have achieved by this flawless narrative.

Add to that the cinematography of Gordon Willis. The lighting in the frames (and lack of it) adds to the sense of intrigue.

The cutting is crisp and helps build the tension.

Undoubtedly a 10/10"
10,More than perfect,"After been about five minutes searching the correct words to describe this movie, I only found that three: ""more than perfect"".

Thank you Coppola for being god!"
10,World's Dramatic Movie of Time,"I, Ronish Baxter like this movie very much. It is most dramatic movie to its time and direction is marvelous. No words to be explain this movie. I can watch this movie many times I can."
9,"Nothing Personal, Just Business","The Godfather is a fantastic movie that shows struggles of the Corleone family, in the midst of a mafia War.

It's hard to write a review about this movie, because so much has been referenced through other media, so much that you would fear it have been watered down because of it, but surprisingly it still holds up 100% today.

The acting is spot on. It Can deliver this funny Italian dialogue in a way where it still believable and does not become distracting, It's a incredible.

The pacing and the story just flows, it does not feel prolonged, it Just shows all the interesting turns in the Corleone family in this horrible time. It is so well done.

If I were before you in person, I could gosh about the performances, about the turns in the story, about the amazing presentation, but I have to spoil to do that, so I will just say go and watch it.

Shows the ending of the old mafia ways, and the beginning of the new, It's a dark, bloody and interesting Family Story, would recommend."
8,Spoiler,Hands down the best movie ever. This will always be a classic
9,brutal,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum."
10,the god father,Amazing movie it is use full and meaning full we can watch the movie and it is very spence
10,Great Movie!,"One of the best movies of all time! ;D

this movie was one of the influences for me to join the filmmaking industry, the lighting. the setting and mainly the characters."
10,Greatest mob movie ever?,"Perhaps the greatest film of all time. Atleast in it's genre. This is the film that started the career of Al Pacino and made a legend of Marlon Brando. Director, Francis Ford Copolla shows how stunningly beautiful violence can be in film. Also how we the viewer can see a little bit of ourselves in the twisted underground realm where passion and tragedy go hand in hand."
10,"Superb cinematography, acting, and plot.","This is probably one of the finest films I've ever seen. Truly it's a classical masterpiece of cinematography and really gripping plot. This movie not only launched the careers of the actors, but also affirmed the heavyweights as well. It beautifully portrays the value of family, with romance, politics, and certainly blatant war. Yet, the movie is almost poetic, with violent scenes that don't drench you in gore, and a language that isn't in your face. Simply put, it's what every great action/drama film should be. A must-see for every true film goer."
9,Great Movie can describe the life of Italian mafia family,"I just love it .. Amazing movie it can make you really fall in love with every single scene in the movie, and the actors did the best and can see how they really live in that moment . great work I've seen the movie many times and I am still enjoying it .. everyone who haven't watch it yet please go and watch it and enjoy it maybe you will tear up and it will make you smile . no man can live without a family no matter how old are you or how rich you are .. Always we need some friends around and our roots and family this is the pretty thing it can make human live in peace We will always love who take care of us and give us smile and protect us"
10,this is my favourite film of all time!,"this film is amazing! it if exactly what i was expecting. it won 5 Oscars but i think it deserves more. Al Pacino is amazing in this film and so is Marlon Brando, James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton they are all brilliant. this film is a masterpiece! it is violent witty and makes u think. i love Francis Ford Coppola and i think this is his best piece of work. i have seen this film 4 or 4 times now and i am still in love with it. i could watch it a thousand times and it would be better every time i saw it! this film deserves 10/10. it is a must see! if you haven't seen it o now and buy the trilogy or rent it! there are really no words to describe this film it is just so good! my favourite film of all time! this film is outstanding!"
10,An indelible mark on cinema history,"Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic. His powerful and nuanced performance brings depth and humanity to the character, making Vito a sympathetic and complex figure.

Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone is equally brilliant. His transformation from a war hero and innocent bystander to a calculating and cold-blooded leader is one of the film's most compelling aspects.

Coppola's direction is nothing short of masterful. He crafts a visually stunning and emotionally gripping narrative, perfectly capturing the atmosphere and setting of the 1940s and 1950s. Coppola's attention to detail and his ability to draw out powerful performances from his cast contribute to the film's success.

""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that excels on every level. Its engrossing storytelling, exceptional performances, and impeccable direction make it a landmark film in the crime genre. The exploration of power, family, and morality, coupled with its stunning cinematography and memorable score, solidify its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
10,An iconic and great film that stands the test of time,"What do we think of when we think of ""The Godfather""? Intense shoot-outs and violence, beautiful scenery, sets, costumes, and cinematography, Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal as the menacing Don Vito Corleone, maybe even the final shot of the film, which speaks volumes. No matter what you think of when you think of ""The Godfather"", you think of greatness.

It's the film that launched the careers of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and Francis Ford Coppola into the realm of the legendary. It's a film that oozes cinematic and artistic mastery. With its seemingly slow-pace and silent ferocity, the film catches you off guard with so many scenes that pack a powerful punch, both emotionally and visually. It's also a film with many personal and sincere moments, dwelling on themes of family, loyalty, and trust; and the consequences of betraying that trust.

It's certainly a film for the ages, and I find something new that I love about it every time I see it."
9,"Great Movie, but highly overrated !","I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but you've already knew it deep inside of you. IT ISN'T THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES !! Yeah, I agree, the story is complex, the acting is outstanding, but all in all it's a proper 8 out of 10."
10,As good as it gets...,"The Godfather has been a tradition in my family forever. Even when I was young I wanted to see what this ""wonderful"" movie was like. Finally, when I was eight, my whole family got together on New Year's Eve to watch the trilogy and The Godfather became my all time favorite movie. There is nothing better. I've seen the movie a million times, and never get tired of it. I also enjoy watching the little documentary before the movie, but that totally spoils some of it if you haven't seen it before. My family says I like Part 1 more than Part 2 because Marlon Brando was in it (yes, partly, but he's my favorite actor), but the story was so much better. Many movies that are based on the book tend to add ridiculous scenes, but the Godfather kept true to the story. All of the actors were wonderful, and now, the Corleone family is like a part of my family."
10,One of the best!,Probably one of the best movies ever made! so its 10 of 10 from me. Wish we could have more good movies like this one now days.
10,Masterpiece,"The film is pretty much near-perfect, what else is there to say. If you haven't seen it, watch it."
9,"Family, power and tradition in our lives don't blend together that's what we learned from the movie","A very exciting drama with a very interesting story, wonderful acting and wonderful special effects that embody the meanings of pain, love, care, the meaning of (the end) for every human being in this world and his written destiny for him."

9,I love it!,"The film's narrative is truly remarkable. It skillfully delves into the depths of each character, weaving a complex and captivating storyline. Initially, I had reservations, but as the plot unfolded, I realized the sheer brilliance of this cinematic masterpiece.

This film stands as a testament to cinematic excellence, ranking among the finest ever made. Its superb acting, intricate plot, and gripping dialogue are exemplary. The climax, particularly the last 20-30 minutes, leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the sequel, rumored to surpass its predecessor. I admire how older films take their time to unfold, allowing characters to develop fully and the story to shine. Rushing through a narrative often results in a shallow experience, a pitfall avoided by this film and many others like it.

In conclusion, this masterpiece deserves to be experienced on the big screen, ideally with friends, to fully appreciate its magnificence."
10,Just Love It,"I consider this as a must watch for all the film enthusiasts out there. This film formed me the understanding on films I have now, and made me love movies as they are."
10,The century's best,"I'll keep it short, this movie is perfect. The performances of all the actors involved, the many memorable scenes, the musical score. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and see it. Well worth the #1 ranking."
10,Belissimo!,"The Godfather is the pinnacle of cinematic art. In no other film have I seen an equivalence in any general aspect of the film. This is special considering how extremely picky I am in terms of movies, but if I would have the opportunity to change this film, I would not. I consider The Godfather to be a single film, not three separate ones. the reason I have so much respect for this particular film is because it encompasses all the values I find most important in life; trust, honor, family and culture. Those are the four that I value completely. This film represents such emotion that I cannot begin to describe how I feel about it now. Plus, most of my favorite actors are in this film; Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, etc..."
10,"Godfather, and just Godfather","Uh, this is the masterpiece of the film industry. I see this movie 100 times, and I'll see it again. I don't know when another movie will be something like Godfather. All actors do the job perfectly, and the whole film have the brilliant story witch end push to the next part."
9,One of the greatest movies,The Godfather is one of my favorites. Action real life events you can't beat it. This movie is one of a kind.when I first seen it I thought it was going to be like every other movie dealing with gangs. But The Godfather taught me lessons I didn't know I could learn from just watching it.
10,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"The Godfather has quickly become this reviewer's favorite dramatic movie. With a mixture of love, action and scandalous plot developments not once in the 175 minutes of watching it did looking at the clock to see how much longer it would be come to mind. There is such a sympathy created for the Corleone family that you end up rooting for them, even though they are a mafia related family. It's crazy to think about really, for instance, this reviewer can't remember the last time she felt sympathy for a murderer The Godfather is amazing, it's well written, and the cast just meshes well on screen. The names can be confusing because they are all Italian and people address each other by their last name most of the time, but after a while it starts to make a little sense. The lead character of the movie is, surprisingly, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). This story follows his coming of age from a young man wishing to get as far away from the business to his deep involvement after some family catastrophes. Upon first introduction Michael is dressed in his service uniform and bringing a new love, Kay (Diane Keaton), to the wedding of his sister. When Kay asks about his family, and his father in particular, Michael explains to her that his father is a mafia leader and he wants nothing at all to be like him. So far, he had been doing very well at trying to keep himself separated, until one day when his father gets shot in the back several times and is put into the hospital. Well, of course, the henchmen aren't going to be satisfied with just putting him in the hospital, they want to finish the job. Luckily, Michael goes to visit his father and upon arrival realizes that there is no one there keeping guard over his father. He calls his brother to get backup and places his father in a different room in the hospital. The suspense in this scene is SO heavy it's almost suffocating, in a good way. There are distant footsteps heard coming toward Michael's father and this reviewer felt her hands clench and her heart beat racing; it was so well done. But this is the point when Michael really starts to enter the mafia; and he only gets deeper and deeper into it as the movie plays out. There is, however, one death scene that is a bit too played out. A character is in a car and suddenly there are a gazillion guys around the car and they all have rapid firing guns. Well, the character is shot while in the car and proceeds to crawl across the seat and exit out the passenger side of the car. At which point, the character puts themselves in full exposure to the henchmen. Why? No clue, but then another 70 or 80 shots are successfully taken AND THEN one of the henchmen proceeds to take a few shots at close range and throw in a few kicks. This is a bit excessive upon reflection but at the time, this reviewer almost cried. It was SO unfair! If it wasn't for the fact that it is completely impossible, jumping into the screen to save the victim was all this reviewer could think of. Once again, it's amazing because the victim wasn't exactly an angel to say the least.

The story is truly what manipulates the audience to feel sympathy for this family. They seem to be falling apart left and right, which is tough to see because they used to be such a strong unit. The values of family love seem to be falling apart with each new marriage, the men are trying to stay ahead in the game but they keep getting attacked from behind because there are traitors amongst the alliances. Personally, this reviewer can't wait to see the two following films in this trilogy and compare them to the first, because topping this one will be extremely difficult. If your looking for an awesome drama, watch The Godfather, it's got a little bit of everything in the story for everyone. It's a great movie to watch on an icky day when you're stuck at home, because it will make time fly so fast."
10,The Best ever,"I have heard people talk about how this is the best movie ever, and I can't join the Argument because I have not yet seen the Film.

Today, I decided to see what all the fuss is about. It was a Film so good that I cannot stop thinking about how good it is.

I am most impressed with its development of Michael. How he was not even an understudy to his brother but yet became the head of the table. His keen observation and probably his Military skill helped him.

Don Vito Corleone is a smart, cautious, and patient man. He only strikes when necessary. He tries to avoid trouble at all costs. And he knows his time is up. And how he hands over power to his son."
10,They don't make films like these anymore.,"I'll be honest, when I watched this film as a 16 year old I had given it a 5 on IMDb. Back then I found it long, slow and boring and wondered why it had such high ratings. What can I say? I was really dumb and stupid at that time. Now at 22, I feel so ashamed for my thoughts about this film in the past. This is a fricking Perfect film. Release in1972, I can only imagine what waves it must have created around the world back then. The characters, their development, the story, acting and everything are solid! Yes it is long and may feel slow paced, but I don't know how 3 hours passed by. An absolute Masterpiece!"
10,Best movie of all the time..,This is the best movie of all the time. My favourite movie ever!
10,The Godfather: A Cinematic Masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, the movie was released in 1972 and has since become an iconic part of cinema history.

The movie follows the Corleone family, a powerful mafia dynasty led by the patriarch, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The story is set in the 1940s and centers around the Corleone family's struggle to maintain their power in the midst of a changing world.

Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary. He brings a sense of gravitas and authority to the character that is unmatched. Equally impressive is Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, who is forced to step up and take over the family business after his father is nearly assassinated.

The movie is a masterclass in storytelling, with a gripping plot that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The themes of loyalty, betrayal, and family are explored in great depth, and the characters are all complex and multifaceted.

The movie is also visually stunning, with breathtaking cinematography that captures the essence of 1940s New York City. The iconic score by Nino Rota is equally impressive, and the use of music throughout the movie is masterful.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It is a must-see for any movie lover, and its influence can still be seen in countless movies and TV shows today. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible."
10,The Godfather : The Greatest Achievement in Cinematic History,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them."
10,Cinema from which it is impossible to refuse.,"The Godfather. Cinema from which it is impossible to refuse. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo have created a truly iconic gangster movie! The Godfather is a story about how a person changes his views and becomes what he might have been destined to be. I would especially like to cancel the excellent cast and especially Marlon Brando, who played the boss of the criminal clan Corleone stern and at the same time smart, intelligent and able to think ahead."
9,Great Movie,"A great gangster movie, after watching I really learn a lot, such as: never let others know your ideas, the real master are not in the mood, the event is indifferent, have their own bottom line; A man who doesn't spend time with his family isn't a man"
10,My Favorite Movie,"If there is one movie that I can say have touched me more than any other I would have to say The Godfather has. It is more than just a movie to me. It is a movie that I will never grow tired of, and will never forget. I enjoy movies like Casino, and Goodfellas, but they can't compare to The Godfather, but to me The Godfather isn't just some mob movie. It is a flawless masterpiece of family and the life of crime. Each actor seems perfect for his role. The Baptism scene is one the greatest scenes in the whole movie. I don't know how to make this review flashy or stand out, but all I can say is that if you are a movie lover, and are easily touched by movies then you will love The Godfather whether you like Mob movies or not. Just a classic."
10,The best movie in the history of film making,"This is the best movie in the history of film making, a good mix movie and its hard to watch that mix again"
10,masterpiece,The best film i have ever watched. an outstanding family portrait. Definitive film. 10 stars.
10,Masterpiece,"Best movie ever created. Full of little details and action. Never gets boring even for a minute. THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be."
10,The Godfather: A Cinematic Masterpiece of Crime and Family,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel, is a landmark in cinema history. Released in 1972, this film is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made. Its intricate plot, unforgettable characters, and thematic depth have captivated audiences for decades.

The story revolves around the powerful and influential Corleone crime family in post-World War II America. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the patriarch, known as the Godfather, who presides over the family with a mixture of benevolence and ruthless efficiency. His three sons, Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino), are positioned to inherit his legacy, though each has a different relationship with the family business.

The film opens with a lavish wedding scene for Vito's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), establishing the complex web of familial and criminal alliances. This scene masterfully sets the stage for the film's exploration of loyalty, power, and betrayal. Coppola's direction captures the intricate dynamics of the Corleone family and the world they inhabit, weaving a tale that is as much about family bonds as it is about crime and violence.

Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is iconic, embodying the character's authority and charisma with subtlety and depth. His portrayal won him the Academy Award for Best Actor and remains one of cinema's most memorable roles. Brando's Vito is both a loving family man and a shrewd, calculating leader, exemplifying the dual nature of his character.

Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, is equally compelling. Michael starts as a reluctant outsider, a decorated war hero intent on living a life separate from the family business. However, as the story unfolds, Michael is drawn deeper into the criminal underworld, ultimately assuming the role of the family head. Pacino's transformation from the innocent and detached son to a powerful and ruthless leader is one of the film's most captivating arcs. His journey is both tragic and inevitable, showcasing the corrupting influence of power and the demands of loyalty.

The supporting cast, including James Caan as the hot-headed Sonny and Robert Duvall as the loyal consigliere Tom Hagen, delivers exceptional performances that add layers to the film's narrative. The ensemble cast brings to life the complex relationships within the Corleone family, making the audience care deeply about each character's fate.

Coppola's direction, combined with Gordon Willis's cinematography, creates a rich visual tapestry that captures the period and mood of the story. The film's dark, shadowy aesthetic reflects the moral ambiguity and danger inherent in the world of organized crime. Nino Rota's haunting score complements the visuals, enhancing the emotional impact of the story.

The film's exploration of themes such as loyalty, power, and the American Dream resonates with audiences on a universal level. ""The Godfather"" portrays the criminal underworld as a parallel society with its own rules and hierarchies, examining the fine line between legitimacy and illegality. The Corleone family's struggle for power and survival reflects the broader American experience, questioning the price of ambition and the nature of justice.

One of the film's most famous scenes is the baptism sequence, where Michael stands as godfather to his nephew while orchestrating the brutal elimination of his enemies. This masterful juxtaposition of religious ceremony and violence underscores the film's central themes of duality and moral complexity.

""The Godfather"" has left an indelible mark on popular culture, influencing countless films and television shows. Its dialogue, such as Vito's iconic line, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" has become part of the cultural lexicon.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the crime genre to explore profound themes of family, power, and morality. Its compelling characters, masterful storytelling, and timeless themes ensure its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Whether viewed for the first time or revisited, ""The Godfather"" remains a powerful and unforgettable experience."

It's just the perfect film."

10,A perfect movie.,"""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""

Out of the vast amount of movies, more than 50,000 total to date as of this review, only a few films are described by many a noted film critic as a ""perfect movie"". However, one of those movies, to me, deserves the title of being the most perfect movie out of 'em all. That movie is the 1972 crime drama by the name of ""The Godfather"".

Based on the novel by Italian-American author Mario Puzo, this was the movie that revolutionized the art of gangster pictures since its inception. This wasn't like films such as The Roaring Twenties (1939) or The Public Enemy (1931), which were about ordinary mobster life. Instead, we focus on an entire family of the mafia that runs a vast empire in New York City, lead by the aging, yet all powerful Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He's retiring from the business, and has to choose which one of his sons to take his place, either the hair-trigger tempered Sonny (James Caan), adopted son, consigliere, and lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), or his youngest son and war hero Michael (Al Pacino). However, as this is happening, unexpected things are happening within the Corleone family itself including selling out and betrayal, and an all-out war between all of the five families (Corleone, Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracci, and Cuneo) is brewing that turns the entire city into a blood-drenched war zone where only one can remain supreme.

The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, whom prior to this was also responsible for movies like Finian's Rainbow (1968), You're A Big Boy Now (1966) and The Rain People (1969), none of which were very successful box office-wise. The Godfather was the turning point of Coppola's career, not just because most of his future pictures would be smash hits, but would also earn him his first Best Picture win. The film itself is poetic, thanks to the assistance from the book's author Mario Puzo, who also wrote the screenplay for the picture. Coppola illustrates both the positive and negative sides of mafia life, the fall and rise of an underground empire, and the meaning of loyalty all at once. All of the main characters in the film are also relatable and three-dimensional to a tee. You actually feel for them and understand their mindset, making it true to life, to where even actual mobsters commend the film for its realism.

Future gangster pictures like Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), and Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco (1997) owe something to this movie, aside from the fact that two of those films also star Pacino, making it about not just about the career of a mobster, but also about the mobster himself and the relationship between his colleagues. In other words, they're in-depth character studies, and that's what makes The Godfather a truly epic and moving film, let alone a film that, as I've mentioned in the beginning, is described as a ""perfect movie"". Even teachers in colleges and universities that teach film studies or any form of filmmaking would refer to showing this film as part of a curriculum. Overall, it's a film that is considered mandatory viewing for every moviegoer, even if you don't like sitting through films that are nearly or over 3 hours. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing right now and see it."
9,The Godfather,"The Godfather is a 2006 open world action-adventure video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. Originally released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows, it was later released for the PlayStation Portable as The Godfather: Mob Wars, Xbox 360 as The Godfather: The Game, Wii as The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, and PlayStation 3 as The Godfather: The Don's Edition.

The game is based upon the 1972 film of the same name, and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, he drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, he plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount never told him about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable. Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in the film, is absent in both likeness and voice, choosing to lend his image instead to Scarface: The World Is Yours.

The Godfather received mixed to positive reviews across most systems, although the PSP version was generally seen as inferior to the others. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million units. In 2009, a sequel was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows. Based on the 1974 film, The Godfather Part II, the sequel did not sell as well nor do as well with critics as had the original, and EA scrapped plans for an adaptation of the third film."
10,This is what perfection looks like!,"There are very few films that can completely hold the viewers attention for their entire duration, and even fewer that are nearly 3 hours long, yet The Godfather manages to do exactly this. It is wonderfully acted and directed, with stand out performances from Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Al Pacino.

It charts the rise and fall of the Corleone Mafia family in New York from the 1950's, and manages to give a believable insight into what it may be like to be a member of the mafia and to not trust anyone.

Once you have seem this film you will understand why it won Best Picture at the oscars."
9,The OG of the game,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that explores power, loyalty, and family with unmatched depth. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it weaves a compelling story of the Corleone crime family, blending tension, drama, and moral complexity. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's powerful transformation into Michael Corleone are unforgettable. With stunning cinematography, a haunting score, and unforgettable dialogue, this film remains a defining moment in cinema, offering a profound exploration of family dynamics, morality, and legacy. Its influence can be seen in countless films that followed, solidifying its place in film history. The film's slow-burn tension keeps viewers on the edge of their seats while providing a deep emotional impact. The Godfather is more than a film-it's a cultural touchstone that continues to resonate across generations."
10,Cult!,"The Godfather trilogy is probably the best movie series about underground mafias and families. Each part challenges the other by doing so,The Godfather Trilogy became the classics that will last till the end of the World.

It makes you feel scared, brave, romantic, and sometimes cruel. Watching it reminds you the value of your life and how it is not valued sometimes when the matter is your honor.

I believe there won't be any other film that can ever again tell the story of underworld and its rules.

Thank you Francis Ford Coppola"
10,There Are So Many Reasons for the Movie's Greatness,"In writing an apology for a film that really needs none, let me begin by noting how many careers were established with this movie, beginning with that of Al Pacino. Pacino had made movies before and was a respected New York stage actor, but this was his breakthrough movie. Brando was regarded as poison: he was impossible to work with, causing movies to lose money with his outrageous demands, so the studio execs despised and distrusted him. This movie, for which he had to suffer the humiliation of auditioning, resurrected him. It opened the door to the memorable ""Last Tango in Paris."" Of course we had all seen Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale in other movies, but this one made them stars. (I don't recall seeing Talia Shire before this.) And it gave Coppola the kind of artistic freedom that would lead to ""Godfather II""--another masterpiece. Puzo, who wrote the book and collaborated on the screenplay, would go on to do the scripts for ""Superman"" and other movies. It was magic for everyone who appeared in it. I am only sorry that the success it brought people like Marlon Brando and Richard Castellano led them to price themselves out of ""Godfather II."""
10,Best movie,"I watched this movie many times, and everything i conclued is that this movie is actually the best movie of all times. It's timeless movie, doesn't matter if it's 1972 producted. Definitely must watch."
10,Amazing!,"Big film art, amazing film and the history. Photography scenes pretty cool and darkness areas of the film is that I liked very much."
10,Pretty good!,"My favourite scene is the horse scene, as for this film i will give it a 👍 to say the least"
9,A masterpiece of crime cinema,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is a timeless classic that stands as a pinnacle of crime cinema. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film delves deep into the intricate world of the Corleone family, offering a compelling portrayal of power, loyalty, and the American Dream. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the formidable patriarch whose influence extends far beyond his criminal empire.

Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, is equally riveting. Michael's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader is depicted with subtlety and intensity, showcasing Pacino's extraordinary range. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, contribute to the film's richly layered narrative, creating a vivid and immersive experience.

Coppola's direction is masterful, balancing moments of quiet introspection with bursts of shocking violence. The film's cinematography, with its chiaroscuro lighting and meticulous composition, enhances the story's mood and themes. Nino Rota's haunting score further accentuates the film's emotional depth and grandeur.

""The Godfather"" is more than just a crime saga; it's a profound exploration of family, power, and destiny. Its complex characters and unforgettable scenes make it a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences, solidifying its legacy in film history."
8,Back to re-product,"Eight years later, it is necessary to revise my own views. The shabby ness is still, but there are also countless great plots and performances by the screenwriter and actors. You can also find that ""The Godfather"" brings audience a ""big screen"" experience which is enough to refute the opposition."
9,Masterclass,The 70s masterclass was Super influential and still a masterpiece of classic films.
10,An offer that I could NOT refuse to see,"I am highly addicted to this movie and I enjoyed it ever since the first time I ever saw it. And to tell the truth I could not take my eyes off of it and I was enjoying it up to the max.

My favorite character in this movie is Michael Corleone, played by a then younger Al Pacino. He is the best in the whole movie next to Sonny and Vito Corleone. I like Michael because of the way he is with his father and also of his rise to the criminal empire.

Sonny is another one of my favorites because he is tough and hard headed and how he defended his younger sister from her abusive husband Carlo Rizzi. But it is a bad thing what happens to him, it was something that angered me.

Vito Corleone is also the best one in this movie and my favorite line of him in the movie is: ""I'm going to make him an offer he cannot refuse"". This is one of the best lines in the movie.

This movie has great music, characters, storyline and I give it a 10 out of 10."
10,THE Movie of the Century,"If and when the world comes to an end, I truly hope a copy of the Godfather is found among the ruins. This movie of which I have seen over 100 times since it's release in '72 has displayed the best of a well put together story about family. This family just happens to be into organized crime. If you have never seen the movie, rent it and relax and let yourself be taken away by the gripping story which is nonstop from beginning to end (of course Godfather II picks up right where this one stops). a 10 in my book now and forever."
10,The Godfather (1972): A Masterpiece of Cinematic Storytelling,"Here's a personalized review of The Godfather (1972), from your perspective:

The Godfather (1972): A Masterpiece of Cinematic Storytelling

The Godfather (1972) is a film that completely engrossed me from start to finish. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it stands as a timeless work of art, blending crime, family, and power into a narrative that's both captivating and haunting.

What really struck me was the depth of the characters. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone is unforgettable, embodying a quiet authority and wisdom that makes you sympathize with a character who is, at heart, a criminal. His portrayal of family loyalty and the fine line between love and control is magnetic. Al Pacino's transformation from Michael Corleone, the reluctant son, into a ruthless leader is nothing short of brilliant. Watching Michael evolve from someone distant from his family's mafia roots to becoming everything he once opposed feels tragic yet inevitable.

The storytelling is meticulously layered, with each scene unfolding with a sense of purpose. The film masterfully weaves themes of power, loyalty, betrayal, and morality in a way that makes you question the price of ambition. The family dynamics, especially between Michael, his father Vito, and his brother Sonny (played by James Caan), felt real and raw, pulling me deeper into the Corleone world.

Visually, The Godfather captures the gritty, dark underbelly of organized crime while balancing it with moments of lavish grandeur, like the wedding scenes or family dinners. The use of shadows and the moody lighting enhanced the sense of danger lurking behind every decision.

What left a lasting impression on me was how the film doesn't glorify the violence and crime; instead, it highlights the emotional cost. The slow-burning tension, the betrayals, and the gradual collapse of relationships felt like an inevitable consequence of the Corleones' world. The scene where Michael takes revenge in the restaurant-one of the most intense moments in cinema-left me holding my breath, a perfect balance of silence, tension, and explosive action.

In short, The Godfather isn't just a crime movie; it's a study of human nature, power, and the tragic consequences of one's choices. It's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, and for me, it's one of those rare films where every element, from acting to direction, comes together flawlessly."
10,Amazing Movie,"The Godfather"" (1972) is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history and a classic in the crime genre. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the story of the Corleone crime family and their patriarch, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando.

Compelling Story and Screenplay: Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola, crafted a compelling narrative that explores themes of power, family, and the consequences of a life immersed in organized crime. The story spans several decades, providing a comprehensive look at the characters' lives and the evolution of the Corleone family.

Outstanding Performances: The cast of ""The Godfather"" delivered remarkable performances that have become iconic in the history of cinema. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, and Al Pacino, who played his son Michael Corleone, showcased an impressive transformation from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader.

Cinematography and Visuals: Cinematographer Gordon Willis's work on ""The Godfather"" is celebrated for its moody and atmospheric style. The use of low-key lighting, shadowy compositions, and the sepia-toned color palette contribute to the film's distinct visual identity, capturing the dark and complex nature of the Mafia world."
10,The Godfather,Marlon Brandon and Al Pacino are just awesome...!😎 Moving is soo good... Especially the dailogues of the movie are just like attitude quotes...!😎 every one in the movie is given importance to their characters.... ! Just awesome...!
10,A classic,"I have been watching this movie my whole life and it never gets old. Legendary actors, classic lines that most people remember and recite by heart. Nobody can deny that this in in the top 10 gangster movies of all time. It has been made into video games, documentaries and has even been the topic of several podcasts, talk shows and overall basic conversation. This movie is so hot that I am sure many people have even based their lives off of sections that they can personally identify with. I keep this movie on my watchlist for the days I'm even feeling nostalgic or can't find anything new to watch. I most definately recommend."
10,Obra prima absoluta,"Pedra angular do cinema americano e mundial, atuações de peso e marcantes"
10,The Godfather,"One hell of an experience, the movie it's a classic and masterpiece, 10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes mob movies."
9,"The topmost crime, drama movie","The godfather is one of the top gangster, crime movies in the world, also best films of all time."
10,Sigma,"The Godfather is the ultimate sigma boy-a lone wolf with an aura so chill it redefines power. Vito Corleone never needed to shout; his quiet, razor-sharp tactics rewrote the gangster manual. In a realm where clout-chasers crave the spotlight, he commanded respect with a cool, calculated vibe that set him apart. His legacy isn't about flashy moves but about silent domination and vintage swagger, turning every scene into a masterclass of unspoken leadership and raw, magnetic presence. This legendary vibe redefines leadership, blending vintage mafia mystique with modern lone-wolf energy. Epic. Absolut skibidi sigma aura movie."
10,Very Impressive Regardless of Age,"A mafia boss who is highly respected but loves his family, that's incredible. But the lesson in this film is that there is no eternal power, above the sky there is still a sky and unity remains the strongest. When it comes to divorce, even a pack of lions will lose to a pack of wolves, trust is really a very important thing.

At the end of the story, it is very moving that the mafia family, which is highly respected, has to fall apart due to the loss of trust. But who would have thought that the plot turned things around, no one thought and no one thought it would end like that. Very very unusual."
10,Masterpiece,"This Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is perfect in so many levels that it's hard to put it into words. It is such a great character study and the performances by Brando, Pacino and Duvall help make it the classic that it is."
10,This Is Very Good Film,"This film is a cinematic masterpiece that not only provides entertainment but also offers a profound experience that will resonate with the audience.

Witness this extraordinary story and let yourself be immersed in the magic of the cinematic world. ""This Is Very Good Film"" is not just a movie; it's an experience that will continue to linger in your mind long after the credits roll."
10,The Corleone Dynasty,"The Godfather is the most influential American film that has ever been released.

So there isn't much more that I can say to really emphasize how much you should watch this film.

An epic film telling the tragic story of the Corleone family who is one of the biggest mafia families set in the 1940s to the 1950s.

A film that really goes deep into the topic of family, power structure and being placed at the head of your family's empire without a choice.

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the two stand out characters.

Without even having any sort of back story you can see the type of power Vito Corleone holds among the family and to see the transition of Michael Corleone become a major head of his family despite originally wanting to have nothing to do with his family's business.

It's a tale that is engrossing from start to finish even being at almost 3 hours long."
10,A movie you can't refuse,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" That line alone is cinematic royalty-and The Godfather doesn't just deserve a 10 out of 10, it redefined what a 10 looks like.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on Mario Puzo's novel, and featuring a stacked, God-tier cast, this film is more than a movie-it's a cultural monument. A masterclass in storytelling, character, tension, and tragedy, The Godfather isn't just about the Mafia. It's about family, legacy, power, and the quiet, cold decay of a man's soul.

Let's talk cast: Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone - iconic doesn't even begin to cover it. The rasp. The power. The calm presence that chills and comforts all at once. Brando didn't act this role-he became the Don.

Al Pacino as Michael Corleone - this is one of the greatest character arcs in cinema history. From soft-spoken war hero to stone-cold Mafia boss, Pacino's performance is terrifying in its subtlety.

James Caan as Sonny - all fire and fury, perfectly counterbalancing Michael's coldness.

Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen - the Consigliere with steel nerves and quiet loyalty.

Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale-every performance is pitch-perfect.

The pacing? It's patient. Deliberate. It simmers, never rushing, never dragging. Every scene is vital. Every silence is louder than most blockbusters' explosions. The horse head scene, the restaurant shooting, the baptism sequence-each one is legendary.

The cinematography by Gordon Willis, aka ""The Prince of Darkness,"" gives the film its moody, shadow-heavy palette-like the soul of the Mafia itself is seeping into the frame. It's rich. It's textured. It's timeless.

Let's not forget Nino Rota's score. That haunting theme? That is the sound of family and death braided into one.

But what makes The Godfather so damn powerful isn't just the blood or the betrayal. It's the tragedy. Michael never wanted this. But the world, the violence, the need for control-it pulls him in, inch by inch. By the end, when that door closes on Kay's face and Michael fully becomes the new Don? That's not a triumph. That's a fall. A quiet, suffocating fall.

Bottom line: The Godfather isn't just one of the greatest films of all time-it is the gold standard. Every crime drama, every serious film about power or family or loyalty, wishes it could touch what this movie did. It's cinematic perfection-crafted with elegance, danger, and emotion.

10 out of 10. A masterpiece etched in stone."
10,amazing movie,"Simply amazing movie. Classic, have watched this title s few times, it does not get old no matter how many times you watch it.

A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Simply a masterpiece :)"
9,It's a legend,One of the ever-lasting legends in the age of science!
10,Revoluiton,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has cemented its place in film history. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, it tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan in New York City.

The film's intricate plot, unforgettable characters, and iconic performances have made it a timeless classic. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family, is considered one of the greatest performances in film history. Al Pacino's transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless mobster is equally compelling.

The Godfather is more than just a gangster film; it's a study of family, power, loyalty, and the American Dream. The film explores the dark side of ambition and the consequences of violence, while also offering a glimpse into the complex dynamics of organized crime."
9,Best one!,Most beautiful movie in my watchlist. Everybody should watch this.
9,Alltime classic,"One of the best Mafia movies ever made; great actors and characters, costly production, awesome plot.

I agree that Brando's portrait of Don Corleone sometimes appears slightly comical but you also have to see that his character is getting old and weak, hence the raspingly low volume voice and he isn't a purely bad Don and very sincere with his family (especially own blood) members and I think Brando was the right man to portrait these kinds of character traits. Also, every time I saw myself thinking it's comical, I also got bad thoughts like 'You can't think like this of the Don', hence this shows, it is a good performance if he makes me scared as a viewer having these kind of thoughts.

There are quite a few people in this movie who only get introduced to the audience on the surface, but play a bigger role towards the end but me as a viewer, I don't feel any bonding to them since I only saw them for 5 minutes before. I think they should've gave them more screen time, so the viewer remembers them better.

Overall, this is a milestone in the history of movie, you have to watch it at one point. Some scenes - You won't forget. 9/10"
10,"Story line up, Acting.","One word for this movie is ""Masterpiece"". You can see the best actors of industry at their peak . Liked that how story moves as Journey of Al Pacino from hating to belonging of Mafia Family to being the Boss itself at the time."
9,This is a great film,"Tied for the best movie I have ever seen.

Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
10,Watching The Godfather is a requirement for Human Citizenship,"Watching The Godfather is a requirement for Human Citizenship. The GodFather is not a movie but more a pillar to understanding the human race. I am going to keep this review short and sweet.. Don't watch the GodFather, but embrace the jewels of life it offers and it will teach you life lessons beyond what you can imagine. <<<---This was what I wrote before IMDb prompted me that my review does not contain enough lines and I need at least 10 lines of text. I will take this opportunity to commend the perfect selection of the cast and crew. Usually, every movie I watch there is ALWAYS some sort of comment or critique I add within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The Godfather & Braveheart are the only two films that I have not had a critique for which still boggles me to this day. The Godfather is the only movie that I could watch over and over and will continue to watch over and over throughout my life, and not get bored even just a little to say the least. This is not a movie..It's A Lifestyle."
10,Cinematic Masterpiece That Has Not Been Surpassed,"A favorite by so many people in the world, Mario Puzo's The Godfather is considered by many, including myself, to be the greatest accomplishment in the history of cinema. Director Francis Ford Coppola has masterfully visualized the ambience and power of the novel. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and the rest of the cast has brought to life one of the most acclaimed film of all time. The popularity of this film is not surprising because it contains memorable music, moving scenes, thought provoking dialogue/phrases and extraordinary acting by an extraordinary cast. At the risk of sounding redundant, which in the case of giving thoughts about this movie is a given, it is so much more than what it seems storywise. If I try to even explain this aspect of the movie, I'd lose myself. This film is important to so many people that I recommend it to anyone that haven't seen it (which are some very unlucky people I might add). Unfortunately, no simple explanation could ever compensate for the experience of watching Don Vito Corleone and His Family's Tale of Crime and Family. In conclusion, I wish to say that everybody should see it for themselves and be enlightened to what could be a wonderful journey and learning experience."
10,Spectacular movie due to a spectacular cast,"You simply can't go wrong when you put together great actor such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and combine them with a great director like F.F.C. Outstanding performances, correct directing and very good story. Not the greatest of all time but sure it is in my top 10."
9,Al Pacino at its finest,A fine example of what a great piece of storytelling and cinematography can be. Al Pacino is the center piece of the whole plot which revolves around Marlon Brandon.
10,love it,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, musicin the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film."
10,Best movie I've seen!,"The best movie I have ever seen in my life!

Great actors, great scenes and plot. I haven't read the book but I am planning to. A must see if you haven't!"
10,Best movie,For me this is the best movie I have watch. 10 stars out of 10
10,Best of the Trilogy,"I know it is such a cliché to say it after thousands of comments, but this is a must-watch movie. You probably have seen all the impostors around acting like Marlon Brando which is funny of course but still it strikes you because of how much effort he put to pull off this movie. Although it might get boring sometimes, the acting and the sense of reality wind you up with the plot making it an easy-to- watch movie. Just to give you some heads-up, the first movie of the sequel can elevate the expectations for the rest, you won't regret for the time you spared for this movie. The plot is designated so well that it encircles you in every way not letting you stop or look away from the screen. In my opinion this is the best mafia-related movie in which all the racketeers and kingpins do not cut a swath and you admire even to the ones who die during the movie. Long story short, this movie definitely deserves its place among the top three in all time favorite movies."
10,Awesome!,Great movie from beginning to end. Best in the trilogy. Great cast. Two thumbs up. 10 stars.
9,Cinema Award,"Cinematically talking is one of the best movies ever recorded. Apart from the storyline, and the starring cast, which astonishingly, with actors such as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando as the godfather, ... The shots taken are measured to the millimetre. That is what makes the movie entertaining from the beginning to the last shot of the film. The Francis Ford Coppola script based on the Mario Puzo's book makes you being engaged and wanting to follow the whole movie. Furthermore, the music background is one of the best ever composed for a cinema movie. Exclusively made for The Godfather.

In light of the above, what makes this movie a cinema masterpiece is the perfect combination of the script, the cast, the soundtrack and the shots. Is everything perfectly combined. Something that happens only once in the history of cinema."
9,BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME STUNNING,"The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

The best movie in my view as God."
10,Awesome,"Best movie ever, watched many times but still it is the best movie watched ever"
10,marlon brando,Its good movie because of Marlon Brando.... And this is one of the favorite movie in list rank is 1st.
9,This. I love it,"The Godfather, is simply a movie of great acting, great shooting and great story all in one mixed pot."
9,Jenius,What a great movie all the time !! already watch 3 times lol
10,The Godfather!,"Great Movie! It shows the life of a true Mafioso, a true Italian man! Anybody that ha sent watch this movie need to! Its just too good! The way the movie is set up, how the family is always first, is just so true. Im Argentine, of Italian descent, and it shows how Italians are, always the family, and you never mess with the family. It shows how the early years of the US Mafia was, even thought this is not based on a true story, it does show how the Mafia was. For those who have not seen this movie and are not sure if they should watch it, i say do it, you truly wont regret it, you will get involve in the movie so fast, and it has so many legendary actors, nothing wrong with this movie, it is one of the greatest movie of all time!"
10,The Godfather,"**The Godfather: A Cinematic Masterpiece**

Francis Ford Coppola's *The Godfather* (1972) is often considered one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film delves into the intricacies of family, power, and betrayal within the context of the American Mafia. With its meticulously crafted screenplay, complex characters, and unforgettable performances, *The Godfather* remains a quintessential example of cinema's power to evoke deep emotion and explore universal themes.

Set in the years following World War II, *The Godfather* revolves around the Corleone family, one of the most powerful Mafia dynasties in New York. At the center of the story is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging patriarch of the family, who tries to balance his role as a loving father with the brutal demands of his criminal empire. The film chronicles the shifting dynamics within the Corleone family, especially as Vito's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), is slowly drawn into the Mafia world despite his initial desire to stay away. As Vito struggles to maintain control over his empire, Michael's journey from an innocent war hero to a ruthless Mafia boss becomes the film's central arc.

One of the most compelling aspects of *The Godfather* is its exploration of the notion of family. In the Mafia world, family ties are everything, and Coppola effectively uses these relationships to examine loyalty, honor, and the consequences of violence. The opening wedding scene sets the tone for the entire film, as Vito's godfather role highlights the intricacies of family loyalty. Throughout the film, we witness how loyalty to the family is both an anchor and a burden. The tension between family loyalty and personal morality plays out in Michael's character arc, as he is slowly pushed into a leadership role that he never wanted but ultimately embraces in order to protect the Corleone name.

The film's screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Puzo, is rich with intricate dialogue and subtext. The writing is sharp and often subtle, with key lines and moments that resonate long after the credits roll. Take, for instance, the famous line, ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse,"" which has become iconic in American cinema. It encapsulates the power dynamics at play in the world of the Mafia while also emphasizing the manipulative force that Vito Corleone wields. These carefully constructed moments not only advance the plot but also build tension, develop characters, and reveal the emotional depth of the story.

Visually, *The Godfather* is a masterpiece in its own right. Cinematographer Gordon Willis, often referred to as the ""Prince of Darkness,"" employs low-key lighting throughout the film, creating a somber, almost noir-like atmosphere. The dimly lit scenes reflect the moral ambiguity of the characters and their actions, adding to the film's haunting tone. The use of shadows, particularly in scenes involving Vito and Michael, is masterfully done, heightening the sense of danger that lurks just beneath the surface of every interaction. The careful framing of shots and the film's pacing contribute to the immersive nature of the story, making the world of the Corleone family feel both intimate and expansive.

Of course, the performances in *The Godfather* are nothing short of legendary. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is one of the most iconic performances in cinema history. With his distinctive voice, mannerisms, and commanding presence, Brando creates a character who is both feared and revered. His portrayal of Vito is not just that of a ruthless crime boss, but also of a father, a husband, and a man burdened by the weight of his own power. The complexity of Vito's character is what makes him such a compelling figure. Brando's performance is full of nuance, evoking sympathy, admiration, and even fear, sometimes all in the same scene.

Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant Michael to the cold-blooded Don is another standout aspect of the film. In his early scenes, Pacino plays Michael as an innocent, idealistic young man who refuses to partake in the family business. As the film progresses, Pacino subtly shifts Michael's character, capturing the inner conflict and moral decay that comes with power. His performance is restrained yet powerful, perfectly capturing Michael's internal struggle and eventual acceptance of his role as the new head of the Corleone family.

The supporting cast, including Marlon Brando's son, James Caan (Sonny Corleone), and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams), further enrich the film, adding layers of complexity to the story. Every character feels fully realized, with each actor bringing something special to their role.

The score by Nino Rota is also integral to the film's atmosphere. The haunting, iconic theme music, with its melancholic and nostalgic tone, enhances the film's emotional depth, perfectly complementing the film's themes of loss, power, and family.

In conclusion, *The Godfather* is a film that transcends its genre. It is a profound exploration of power, family, and identity, set against the backdrop of a violent and morally complex world. With its exceptional storytelling, direction, and performances, it continues to be a touchstone of cinematic achievement, influencing generations of filmmakers and audiences alike. It is a work of art that still resonates today, and its impact on cinema remains immeasurable. *The Godfather* is not just a movie; it is an experience."
10,Life and family movies,"No matter how great power and great ambition. Anyway, your family makes your life the happiest."
10,"Action, Mafia and Don Corleone","The godfather is a special movie.The Godfather is an instant classic, a masterpiece of the American Film industry and one of the greatest films that has ever been done. Like i said in the summary, this film contains action scenes that are brutal and everybody knows despite not yet having seen the godfather, because this film is excellent, so we already seen some of its scenes. I remember that before i see this brilliant film, i had already seen one of its greatest scenes in the Simpson's's. Well, i would just like to say to the ones who haven't seen this movie yet, that this is definitely one of the movies that we must see before we die. The Godfather brutal action scenes, an awesome story and a great great great performance by Marlon Brandon as Don Corleone. Don Corleone is one of my favorites characters of all time. is quotes are legendary. You must see the godfather. It's perfect"
10,Excellent Movie!!!,"Of course it had to be #1 movie in the whole world!!!! Its a masterpiece!!! Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton,etc., WOW I don't have words, they are the best. Excellent Movie!!! The story really got me, especially Al Pacino's performance because you can't really see what Mr.Pacino is thinking and it scares you, his stare just impacts anyone!!! WOW Excellent Performance!!!"
10,Just amazing,"This movie is a masterpiece from start to finish. The acting, music and directing is unbelievable. The greatest movie of all time."
10,"The film ""The Godfather"" - watched several times, because it is an amazing film, one of my favorites!","The film ""The Godfather"" - watched several times, because it is an amazing film, one of my favorites! The film has a very good cast - Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are great, strong actors. All the actors in this film did their part brilliantly! The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius. The music in the film is wonderful, the script is excellent, the film is a masterpiece! This is a movie that everyone should watch at least once. Although the film is about the mafia, about crime, it is still based on human relationships, the lives of people who make mistakes, need help and support in difficult times, about friendship and betrayal. Although the film is long, it consists of three parts, but it looks with great interest, because there are no extra scenes in the film, every moment is interesting! A wonderful family drama, with the cruel rules of the mafia of life, and with an excellent cast! The best, successful film in the cinema about the mafia."
10,"Beautiful colors, script, character chemistry, and acting","""The Godfather"" is one of those movies that everyone has heard of, everyone knows scenes of, and is quoted, parodied, and paralleled in everything from major movies to children's cartoons. There's the raspy voice of Don Corleone, the bloody horse's head in bed, and the actors for which the film defined their careers (Robert Duvall, Al Pacino that make this film). All of these things make this film a unique addition to American cinema and a classic to remember for years. The plot follows the trail of the Corleone family for several years after the assassination attempt of the family patriarch, Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). After the Don is unsuccessfully gunned down by five shots from rival's gang, his son Michael (Al Pacino) is forced to take over through a series of unfortunate events. One of the beautifully tragic events in this movie is Michael's transition from naive to a mob leader in his father's name. This movie has it all-action, drama, love, beauty, and politics. It is a must-see of American Film and a institution for mafia films and will be for years to come."
9,Good Film,Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. But one fake friend can do more damage than 5 enemies.
10,Amazing,"The most outstanding of all time, a cult film about the Sicilian mafia and its head - Vito Carleone (played by Marlon Brando). A film based on Mario Puzo's book of the same name, directed by Francis Coppolo (who became a great Hollywood director thanks to the film).

Sometimes the ingenious play of the actors and the genius of the efforts of the director himself, even from a fairly primitive mafia film, can make a masterpiece for all time, which will disperse into winged expressions, memes... No more than a dozen such crime dramas as ""The Godfather"" have been filmed in the entire history of cinema, which once again confirms the luck of everyone who created this outstanding film."
10,The Greatest,"This is simply one of the greatest movies of all time. With amazing performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan, and Marlon Brando. I know it is one of my favorites and I would recommend this film to anyone who really likes and a appreciates movies."
10,"This film was soooo good and amazing and brilliant, no wonder it is one of the greatest films of all time.","The Godfather is a brilliant and flawless film. From start to finish, with Coppola's incredible directing skills, a just downright brilliant a screenplay and incredible acting, it is no wonder many consider this is the greatest film of all time. Even as 12 year old watching this, I can still truly understand how amazing this film is. Every shot has significance and with instantly quotable and amazing lines. I can't even put into words how much I loved this film. And after watching it about five times now, I can't find any flaws in the narrative or directing. I can't even find the words to describe how amazing this is and how much I loved it, but that was my attempt. Thank you, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for this masterpiece."
10,Epic Masterpiece,"I had heard about this movie (who hasn't really?) and I had a desire to watch this film. Yet, I couldn't because no one I knew had it, and I couldn't buy it. So, I decided to get the next best thing, and I read the book. I read the book in about a week, and I was astonished that such a book had existed and I hadn't read it before. So, my desire to watch the film was greater than it had ever been before. Finally, I was able to watch it. And, my God in Heaven. If I could, I would name my first born child Don Corleone (that's a joke) and make him look exactly like Marlon Brando. The acting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, everything is fantastic. The only thing I can critique on is the action, and the fact that it was semi-cheesy. But, this is too be expected, as it was made in the early 70's, before great special effects. Despite this, I'd give this film 11/10."
10,Perfecto!,The best movie I have ever watched! I have watched it for the first time in Feb 2017 and could not stop myself from watching the sequels at a stretch. All of the 3 parts are very amazing. I liked the second part better where michael transforms into a don due to circumstances and he nails it. The first part is like foundation without which the second part would not have been that perfect. Everything is so flawlessly presented that I felt like I was living the story. This (Godfather series)tops my list anytime.
10,Absolutely Fantastic,"About a month ago , i found the trilogy of The Godfather on tape, it was at a cheap price so i bought it. It was one of the best purchases i have made this year. This is THE best trilogy of all time. Even if you dont like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino or James Caan's other movies, you should check out this one, it is great , i hope you will enjoy it has much has me."
10,"Fantastic, but not the best.","The Godfather is possibly one of the best constructed films I have ever seen: the lighting and colouring are perfect, giving every frame an almost painting like quality; the camera work is brilliantly modest; and the film hosts some of the greatest acting ever committed to celluloid.

However, there is something about the film which stops me from becoming as emotionally involved as I feel I could have been. Maybe its just the story itself, which I personally cannot connect to. It feels cold, but I'm sure that's the intention.

So, definitely one of the greatest films ever made, however I cannot agree with other posts claiming it is a better film than Citizen Kane."
10,The high praise is well earned,"Based on the novel by Mario Puzo: in the post-war period of 1945 - 1955 in New York City, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) leads a criminal family business and is often at war with other Mafia families as well as other enemies. Vito's son, Michael (Al Pacino), wades into the family business and is groomed to eventually lead it.

Director Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the screenplay with Puzo. The creative team does an excellent job in deceiving the viewer: while we can see that the family does terrible things, we can't help but sympathize with them occasionally especially as they are vulnerable to the acts of other criminal families and betrayals from within the clan. This works mainly due to many scenes involving extended family - the highlight being the enjoyable wedding scene at the film's beginning. The folks we see in such scenes seem to be likeable people.

The acting is brilliant overall with Brando and Pacino standing out. Brando gives a wide-ranging performance especially in the second half where he shows a more mellowing attitude compared to his ways in the first half. And there are many things to praise about Pacino - one of them being his ability to incite terror just by giving a still, brief glare. Pacino also carries the film's mid-section with a series of scenes involving a hospital, a restaurant, and Sicily in that order (a succinct summary). These segments, like others in the film, are intense with perfect build-ups.

The film's most powerful scene involves one where Michael is literally being a godfather at his nephew's baptism. The holy atmosphere of the event is contrasted, back and forth, with other scenes (involving family business) that are anything but holy. The polar opposites play brilliantly against each other in an almost sarcastic way.

And the film ends with a poignant scene between Michael and his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), and a powerful closing image. A perfect ending for a perfect film.

In addition to the great performances of Pacino, Brando, and Keaton, the excellent cast also includes James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Abe Vigoda, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Gianni Russo, Morgana King, Richard Conte, Lenny Montana and Simonetta Stefanelli.

10,Innovative movie of Gangster Genre,"""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a good man."" ""Never let anyone know what you are thinking""

These overwhelming quotes are the most discussing insights of this popular gangster trilogy- The Godfather. The first installment released in 1972 and gained both commercial and critical acclaims.

The first part revolves around the godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and how he deals with his competitors at NY city. At the same time, he is too caring about his family. He wants to involve his younger son Micael Corleone (Al Pacino), who just returns from World War 2. He has a faith on his younger son than his two elder sons. He faces different troubles from his anti groups lead by Solozzo, to whom Vito refused to do narcotic business. Vito thinks that narcotics would harm the society a lot. And, he aspires to stop Solozzo by sending his men and later his elder son Sonny. But it was Michael, who successfully defeats in battles with the help of Clemenza (Richard Castellano), who is a caporegime and the godfather of Sonny. In a battle with the opponents, Vito losses his elder son Sonny. Also, in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins.

The performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino was quite remarkable and the accolades they received proved this.

In the 30th Golden Globe Award, the film had won the categories for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Picture - Drama out of 7 nominations. In the 45th Academy Award (Oscar), the film had nominated in 11 categories,and out of them, it won three of the Academy Awards: Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. The interesting fact is that, Marlon Brando refused to take the Oscar for raising his voice against the poor treatment of American Indians by the film industry who have virtually no representation in the film industry and were primarily used as extras"
10,The godfather,Truly an amazing film up there as one of my favorite films of all time if you like these types of movies watch it now if you haven't seen a movie like this watch it now you will love it.
8,Awesome !,"The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""

It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

6/10."
10,Classic,"All time fav. Great cinematography, great acting, great all around."
10,Classic,"The Godfather is not just a movie it's a masterpiece. Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film is a defining moment in cinema history, delivering a gripping, emotional, and intense story of power, family, and loyalty. From its unforgettable performances to its beautifully crafted storytelling, this film is the gold standard of filmmaking.

Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone delivers one of the most iconic performances of all time, embodying the role of the powerful yet complex Mafia patriarch. Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone is nothing short of phenomenal, taking the audience on a journey from an innocent outsider to a ruthless leader. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, all add depth to this unforgettable film.

The cinematography, music, and dialogue are near perfection. Every scene is meticulously crafted, with tension that slowly builds until it reaches its unforgettable climax. Nino Rota's haunting score adds to the film's atmosphere, making it even more immersive.

Whether you're a fan of crime dramas or not, The Godfather is essential viewing. It's a film that has stood the test of time, influencing countless movies and directors. A true classic that deserves every bit of its legendary status."
10,"Well, I kind of like that movie","Well, I kind of like that movie. I thought she did a really good job. ... I really like that movie. ... i love this movie, ... I really enjoy writing about his plots."
10,"Almost 30 year later, and still the best film ever made","I'm a member of Generation X and was born the year THE GODFATHER was released. I didn't see it until about 5 years ago and was mesmerised at the ability of film to translate a tale with such a respect for the characters it is portraying.

I believe Francis Ford Coppolla adapted the screenplay along with the author of the original Godfather. His young, fresh and hungry talent is the reason we have this film today.

Every element of the film adds to tell the tale of family and loyalty, memorable characters with settings, wardrobe and cultural experiences that I will enjoy forever. The rich sadness of ""The Godfather"" theme (composed by Coppolla's father) alone brings tears to my eyes. The Godfather is the result of a truly gifted filmmaker.

In ""the Godfather"" the infallible image of ""Don Corleone"" combined with the performance of a lifetime is horribly disrupted with the multiple attempts on his life. We see his humanity in the once believed unstoppable Santino Corleone when his own fall takes place. The growth of character of Michael Corleone is like none other I've ever seen, this innocent school boy, turned in to this cold-blooded killing machine, in the name of ""business.""

Only in film can we, the audience, sympathise with such heartless killers and admire the strength of Sonny, the honourability of the Godfather, and the resurgence of the new Godfather.

Who knew a bunch of Italians and non-Italians could come together a portray such a glorious image of an Italian family?

And thank God, Francis Ford Copolla stuck to his instincts and prevented Danny Thomas from playing Marlon Brando's part, Burt Reynolds from playing Sonny and Robert Redford(there are blond haired blue eyed italians) from playing Michael. There's a nobility in the final cast, including his own sister, who plays Connie. It's a film about loyalty, and family, ""Do you spend time with your family? Good, because a man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man.""

And for the length? A film is to transport you into another world, one that you may or may not be familiar with. For those of us who suffer from short attention fans, you should not see this film. Films today are about packing as many violent, sexually explicit images, and colourful special effects,as possible in order to entertain the Attention Deficit Generation. Thank goodness the Godfather was created before this time and thank god there is a segment of society that is able to enjoy the quality of this film.

I give this film a 10 out of 10, an honor that no film I have ever seen, besides, The Shawshank Redemption, has ever been bestowed by myself."
8,Oh my god,Is vere cool this serie i am very happy to selected this tittle
10,A movie I'll never forget. A movie without a flaw,"This movie has everything, beautiful acting, strong directing, mind blowing script. I'll never forget this movie for many reasons, 3 already stated above and also the last reason is because its portrayal of mafia underworld couldn't be any nearer to the truth. I'll never get tired of watching it. The casting is perfect as no other actor could probably portray these characters better. This is due to the number of auditions and the right choice made by Francis Ford Coppola. The music is so perfect for this movie that it just draws you in.

I still think Al Pacino deserved an Oscar for this because he obviously has done his homework here."
10,One of my favourite ..,"This is my first review. It is an excellent and very well done movie There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This is one of my all time favorite. This movie stands at the top in all decades. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now."
9,Review about Film The Godfather (1972),"In the history of cinema The Godfather (1972) will be remembered as one of the best movie & all time favorite o movie lovers. Acting, Direction, Editing, Cinematography it has done well in every department."
10,Should have left it alone.,"This movie is a masterpiece. They should have left it alone. Everyone talks bad about the 3rd; but the 2nd was to the 1st, what the 3rd was to the 2nd."
10,my favorite oldie,I watch this movie with pops often. we have all the family watching
10,A masterpiece,Undoubtedly great piece of work and performance by each and every on great
8,True modern day classic movie.,"Although not my favorite film of all time this ranks up there pretty close to the top of the pile. The cast alone is enough to make you shake at the thought of watching it. This brutal film is also funny and clever. It has bullies, cold calculating killers, bent cops, one or two nice guys, a plethera of wise guys and the dismembered head of a dead race horse thrown in (to bed) for good measure.

Only 8.5 out of 10 for me i'm afraid; I feel that it went on a tad too long. I believe that most films should only last for 2 hours max. Although I must confess in this case this movie could just be better than most?!

Any longer than 2 hours and I would feel like I was showing off if I were a film maker if you know what I mean?? It's only my opinion though :)"
10,good film,"An important place in American history is the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxich dons. Who knew at that time that this ""bunch of Sicilian emigrants"" would occupy a high place in the United States and in the history of this country."
10,The greatest of all time,"The story, the characters, the families and the acting. This is the greatest of all time indeed. How Michael goes from being the war hero non- criminal, to become the leader of the biggest crime family is just amazing. But the best thing about the movie is Marlon Brando's performance. Just astonishing and it will be remembered as one of the greatest acting performances in film. I love how the conflicts build up during the movie, and that they can not trust anyone except their own family. If you love mob and crime movies, this is one for you. The music is also terrific, it fits the scenes perfectly. It is a great directed movie by Francis Ford Coppola and he keeps up the impressing work in The Godfather Part 2. The first 2 months I watched this movie 6 times, and the number is still increasing. Can not get enough. 10/10"
10,The Best,The best movie i ever seen !! I see it again and again !!! The Godfather is my favorite movie !!!
10,Is the best,The best movie in the history.i love godfather part1 and great marlon brando. H's godfather movie
9,i think,"This movie is one of the best movies i seen, great actors, we liked the bad people and this was the most negative part."
10,Been a fan of Godfather Movies Always!,"I'm still watching all parts again and again and never get bored of them. Its 2024 now, firstly I watched this part in 2016 and its still same whenever I go and watch it.

I maybe am the super fan of their work but when I look at social medias and all, people are even crazier than me. This movie have changed perspective of so many and inspired a lot of them who watched it.

Well, if you're the one who haven't yet watched this movie or any of its parts.

Make a quickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk decision and watch it full. It's definitely worth it and you'll fall in love with this show and almost everythinggggggggggggg.

See you at the other end!"
10,The must recommended film for every men to be gentlemen,"The Godfather is a story of what it is to be a man- to be feared, respected and to be one who stands by his word, who has to take care of his family and provide for them, stand with tem in difficult times and good times. Nice story, excellent representation of life shown in this movie. Shows people the life when they have everything also the life when they have nothing. Shows life before death and also also the scarry death. Very nice acting by the cast particularly Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. I am really impressed by the acting performances of all the actors on screen. Very nices storytelling, interesting, engaging and full of thrill and suspense. I had a good time watching this film. Didnt knew how fast time flew watching this film. I recommend this film to all men out there to have a spine and to never bow down to any foolish people, stand by your word and have the last say. I rate this movie 10 stars on 10. This movie is a crime thriller movie yet it is as much real and relatable to the audience. Family life, family struggle, every day problems all shown in the movie. This movie deserves a huge shoutout. Glad to see that this movie being so old is still fresh and releavnt to the todays audience. Evergreen film."
10,Almost impossible to do better!,"I still don´t get how it took so long to have this movie on DVD, specially considering all the crap it´s been ""burned"" nowadays. Anything anyone could say about this movie will be hopelessly short. And I wonder why? I mean, how come a mob family novel became an obliged reference of movie making? It´s not certainly the only mob movie neither mob movie masterpiece. But, there is the fine balance between poetry and crime, honor and reckless vengeance. There are the unforgettable lines at the precise time that make this film so believable, so close to everyone that makes you fall in love with Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. There is pain, love, crime, vengeance and the greatest solitude of the powerful man that has to lie to his beloved wife.

If you have not seen this all time masterpiece, don´t wait any longer to HAVE IT you will never get tired of it!"
9,No Gangster is best then this...!,"A beautiful family gang like a gangster, this movie is like that you watch it every time and you think you are watching this first time"
10,Films Don't Get Much Better,"I have watched The Godfather so many times I'd be rich for every dollar viewed, that said, I cannot fault this cinematic masterpiece, that perfectly romanticizes organized crime. The characters develop especially Al Pacino's Michael, but all the actors have something to do and say and in a style that has today become synonymous with Coppola. The violence is stylized like a 1950s movie. The dialogue moves every scene forward. It breaks every rule by starting with a wedding and it works. Coppola has great fun with every scene, so evident in his use of family members, notably Talia Shire. Writing this has made me want to watch it again. Perfection!"
10,One of THE BEST,Everyone please don't read reviews of The Godfather.Just watch this masterpiece. No words to describe.
10,An exceptional classic film!,"An exceptional classic film!

I have many words of praise and I don't know where to start... Any word is superfluous. It's like trying to describe a historical work of art. It is enough to look at it.

The film is impressive, which makes you break away from reality and teleport to those times. Exceptional direction, with formidable actors who fit the characters very well, and the script and the frames are also exceptional."
10,A real classic,Godfather such a beautiful movies. My favourite Sir Marlon Brando at his best. The scene where Don's adopted son sings a song at his sisters wedding is so natural that you feel its not an acting its reality. A must must watch...
8,My Big Fat Sicilian Wedding,"Big shout out to Flashback Cinemas for helping me finally, FINALLY, get this off my list of shame.

Of course now I'm left in the precarious position of having seen it and NOT thinking it's the best thing ever. I really wonder how much of that is due to the films own legendary status because it's impossible to go into this for the first time and not know it's supposed to be one of the finest pieces of cinema ever crafted.

I mean don't get me wrong, it's good. The performances are... WHAT HAPPENED TO AL PACINO?! I didn't know he could even do this! I think my first exposure to Pacino was The Devil's Advocate and he's been pretty over the top in most things I've seen but in this he's so quiet and understated but you know there's alot beneath the surface. Brando is great. Would have liked subtitles though for him, honestly.

I think what I most appreciated though was the way it handles the audience. These days it seems like most movies can't do anything without trying to explain everything. We get inundated with exposition but not here. Things are laid out beautifully so that just by paying attention you pick up on what's going on and who people are.

There are a LOT of people though. With a lot of very Italian names. Had a bit of trouble keeping the rooster straight in my head. Fortunately this is one I'd definitely enjoy revisiting, which I can only imagine to be a deeply rewarding experience because it feels like there are a lot of layers here to explore and new things to hone in on.

It's a great movie. I just don't think any movie could really live up to the massive hype machine of The Godfather. I can only imagine my estimation of it increasing though with future viewing."
10,Finally the classic Mob Trilogy has arrived on DVD,"This is one of the most eagerly anticipated film series ever (along with Alien Saga, Die Hard etc) and marking Paramount´s greatest DVD effort yet. The First Godfather film involves the epic story of The Corleone Family, where each member is supurbly acted by a superb cast, top notch from the principle parts to the smaller ones. As head of the Corleone family Don Vito (outstanding Marlon Brando) is ambushed and shot and put to hospital, his sons, Michael youngest of them, unwilling heir of the family top spot (Al Pacino), hot head oldest brother Sonny (James Caan), and quiet middle brother Fredo (John Cazale) must take control over the family business while he is gone, and rely on Don Vito´s new consigliere Tom Hagen´s (the always great Robert Duvall) and end the conspiracy bestowed upon them. The story is perfectly vowen, marvelously executed violence scenes. It´s a movie that must be seen by any movie fan, this is as perfect as movies become. No different is The Godfather Part II, even possibly better than the first one, this movie however is longer and is split up as two stories intercutting in parts, one showing the life and rise of younger Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and the other his son Michael tightening his grip on his family business, alienating his wife kay (Diane Keaton) in the 1950´s. The third and weaker of the Godfather movies but not all that bad, involves middle-aged Michael legititimizing his earlier crime business, while trying to win back his ex wife Kay. However new enemies within and outside the family ultimatelky corrupts the business and resulting in his retirement, as his son in law Vincent (Andy Garcia) ascend as the new Don, with the help of Michael´s hardened sister Connie (Talia Shire). The weakest performances come from George Hamilton as Michael´s new lawyer B.J. and Coppola´s own daughter Sofia as Vincent´s cousin and lover, which isn´t to say Sofia is all bad but doesn´t really have the experience for this pivotal role. The Video transfers aren´t all that top notch showing some grain but never-the-less show flawless detail and color resolution, the audio transfers are deliverd in powerful detail and gives the subwoofer a run for its money. The special features are all good and interests showing good value, Coppola´s commentaries on all three movies is as informative and interesting as they come, commenting on the cast behind the scenes facts, the how´s and why´s, his feeling about the third movie´s pointlessness. The facts are all here, the features as great as can be expected from a highclass trilogy such as this.

Godfather: 5, Godfather 2: 5, Godfather 3: 3"
10,perfect,"""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. After a long time of waiting I was able to see this acclaimed film, and I must say that the high ratings I noticed are absolutely not wrong. In this film everything is perfect: the actors are the best point in favor of the film, Marlon Brando among all, incredible. Also Al Pacino, James Caan and everyone else have been excellent in their roles. The characters are iconic, everyone! Starting from Don Vito Corleone, one of the characters I love most in the history of cinema (all due especially from the huge performance of Brando), to Michael Corleone, also excellent. The direction of Coppola is incredible as well as the photography, the film also for this factor has always entertained me while lasting 3 hours, which are not heavy. This last factor, that of rhythm, is mainly due to the excellent plot and the excellent writing made and thought. For the '70s, the quality of the music, like photography, vocal audio and special effects are fantastic. During the movie there is a lot of suspense, especially in the movie end, which is excellent. I loved very much the fact that they wanted to insert strong and touching scenes not limited even to the level of cruelty and topics treated, that are very interesting. The setting is perfect for the genre and the costumes as well. I can't wait to complete the trilogy, I expect a lot after this movie.

. Rating: 9.9/10."
10,Awesome thanks,Thanks for the cool movie it's the best i love to watch it again and again
9,A movie you cannot refuse!,"With many classic moments, amazing performances, a gripping narrative, as well as incredibly assured direction by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is truly unmissable. Any self respecting film fan who has not seen this film should rectify that without delay."
8,It is gorgeous,"I'm shocked that this movie was released in 1972??? It looks so much later. That's half compliment (obviously it is very well done to be able to transcend its time) and half disappointment. I must confess that I prefer my films to look like grainy, cheap, early 70s flicks. However, I like the way this film looks warm and expensive, high quality, and both completely modern and like a 1950s technicolor film. It's really nice.

The movie is really good, yes. But it's a little overrated. People act like this is one of the best films ever made but Suspiria is flawed?? I expected a thriller, and this is a drama. But that doesn't mean I wasn't able to enjoy it. Some of my best friends are drama movies. I DO think this is an incredible film but I still think it's slightly overrated, it's not the best movie of all time and neither is Citizen Kane. How do people not understand that Psycho or Touch of Evil top those movies?

Okay, that's my rant. Now, this movie is actually pretty incredible. It manages to, despite not really being a thriller, give you a very visceral reaction to several key scenes in the film. It slowly builds these moments up until you're on the edge of your seat and it does it in a way that's different from most thrillers (no tense music or fast back and forth shots that might indicate people on the brink of being caught) so that you don't even realize you're supposed to be scared but it just comes up nonetheless. This film is genius in that respect.

The drama part is actually really good as well. Honestly it does get you really invested into the members of the family, but despite the three hour runtime I felt like it left a few threads unfinished. Perhaps if the pacing had gone up slightly and they'd cut the part about what happened while Michael was in Italy they could have gone deeper into the dynamics between the sister and her husband or given us more investment with the middle brother. But maybe that's just my preference, and following Michael in Italy did allow us to see him more as the main character. I guess I wouldn't have minded if the film was 4 hours in order to go deeper into everyone, and that's how you know it's a good movie.

Like I said, great movie, it's just the people who love it act like it's the most important thing ever made in the history of media, which kinda turns me off. It's certainly good, but there's still many films ahead of it."
10,A+++,"Very good movie, TONY MONTANA MF4ERS ratatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatata"

10,I love America.,"From start to end, you are constantly reminded that you are watching one of the greatest movies ever made.

10,Best Movie of all time,Great Movie and I strongly recommend to anyone looking to have a good taste of ACTION and epic stories.
10,It's the best movie ever made,I don't care if it's not in the first place on the list... The Godfather is the best movie ever made.

10,Something about man,"""Don't hate your enemys,it will made you weak!""

I always remeber this sentence.

Thank you,godfather~"
10,It really deserves to be praised!,"I'm too considering as this movie has to be praised. I watched it when I was only 8. And now I am 31, and really I enjoyed even I watched it many times. Thanks for the director Mr. Coppola, producers, actors & actresses who played in and executed it. This movie was the best I've ever watched in my all life. Thank you boyz & girlz."
10,THis film,"This isn't merely a beautifully crafted gangster film or an exceptional family portrait. It's an impressive period piece and a deep character study. It offers valuable insights into filmmaking and serves as an inspiration for generations of actors, directors, screenwriters, and producers. To me, it represents something greater: the definitive film. 10 out of 10 stars!

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate."
10,A one time hit ....,"See something new every time I see it.A right mixture of tragedy and comedy.Found a common love and appreciation everywhere screened. Characters and all of the different personalities caricatured in this movie lives among us.The cast is so popular and familiar which attached me to the cast very much as true to the life.Sounds, music, color and light in this film are just remarkable. The methodology followed in filming each frame is highly appreciated.Emotions conveyed in the film can be felt in depth by each one of the viewers clearly and at large.Who can rate this wonderful movie for which the a simple common rate card is not suffice."
8,One of my favourite movie.,"The best movie, i have ever seen. And a family movie."
10,An absolute masterpiece!,"A complex movie to watch and, surely, difficult to have been produced.

Mythical scenes that will remain in the unconscious public collective like the beginning of Marlon Brando with a characterization for the unique and masterful character. A magnificent cast of actors for a unrepeatable cinematographic work! From start to finish: cinema masterpiece!"
9,It is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema,"I think that whatever I say, I do not give this great movie its due. It is truly a legend among films, Also, there are no films so far that blow up the style and workmanship and one of the best produced in the 2000s."
10,Apart of the 80's culture,"This movie is just one of the ""You have to love"" films. Never gets old or outdated. Like ever! Majority of all the reviews that were already left, about this movie, has already been said. If I were to piggyback off anyone. It would this. Get you some popcorn, sit down and relax. Matter of fact, I'm about to watch it as I type. The acting in this film, fits the narrative of gangsters and mob bosses. Infact, you would think, that these actors were just living their normal lives, with a camera following around them. Now those are some facts, about a great film. You couldn't find any set of actors in today's world, to play this movie any better."
8,agreed,"""Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.

The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.

Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.

But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.

To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.

But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.

Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).

Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.

If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film. "" I completely agree"
10,It is old but gold,"I was not a huge fan of old movies until I saw The Godfather. Before I saw it, I used to think that old movies were boring, and if it lasted more than 2 hours it would be even more. But then I decided to give it a chance, and now I consider myself kind of a fan of this trilogy. It talks about the story of Michael Corleone, who was the son of Vito Corleone, a respected leader of the Italian mafia in America and played a central role in the story. Most people think that it is just a mafia story, some even think that it focuses on drugs, but it really goes beyond just that, it is a story that shows us the development of Michael, a character who from the beginning seems to be in total disagreement with the family business, but the love he has for his father and the respect for him, transform him into the perfect successor, willing to change his principles in order to support his father and his family, since these are his main pillars.

This film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is based on the novel ""The Godfather"", written by Mario Puzo in 1969, which tells in depth the story of Michael and his father, making some leaps in time to contextualize the present of this Italian mafia. The spectacular thing about the trilogy is how the scripts of these movies are structured in such a way that they manage to perfectly represent the story of each of these characters and how power and in this case, love and deep respect for his father and his family can change the ethics and morals of a character who from the beginning seemed incorruptible. A character that was played by Al Pacino, who did an excellent job to represent the different stages that Michael went through these three films, as well as Marlon Brando who played Vito in his old age and Robert De Niro who played him in his past, represented in the second film, therefore both the performance of the cast and the excellent work on the stages, give us an exciting and quite interesting story."
10,Must see,For the classical mafia movie fan it is a must see. I still have the physical copies myself of the trilogy.
10,Very good,"when I watched this move I thought it was boring but when the story unraveled it was one of my favorite movies.it is most certainly a perfect film If you have not seen it you almost have to. have to just for reference it comes on peach tree all the time. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right."
10,Really G,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox."
8,"Fantastic film, 8-10","The godfather is a great film that shows an accurate sense of crime during its time period. Almost very predictable but still very enjoyable, with many secrets through out the entire movie such as the oranges displayed before a death occurs is a very unique way to connect with the audience. This has been a favorite of mine since the first time I have seen it and it remains one of my favorite. Seems like a very hard movie to film with all of its different shots and angle throughout it keeps the audience on it toes and interested. I can watch this movie a hundred time and still be very interested. After watching it I left the room and i midfield expected to be shot down upon exiting the classroom. Once again just a fantastic movie and everyone should watch at least the first one."
10,God Father,"""The Godfather"" is an iconic masterpiece of American cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, the film tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful and ruthless Italian-American mafia clan based in New York City. The movie stars Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family, and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, his youngest son who reluctantly becomes involved in the family business.

The movie is a classic tale of power, loyalty, betrayal, and family, and it is expertly crafted in every way. The acting is superb, with Brando and Pacino delivering unforgettable performances that have become legendary in the world of cinema. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, is equally impressive, and each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles.

The cinematography is stunning, with beautiful shots of New York City and the Italian countryside. The score, composed by Nino Rota, is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly captures the mood and tone of the film.

The writing is sharp and engaging, with memorable dialogue and a complex and intricate plot that keeps the viewer engaged from start to finish. The themes of the movie are universal and timeless, and they resonate with audiences even today.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time. It is a must-see for anyone who loves movies, and it deserves its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
10,This Movies Changes my Life Completly,"I love that movie and every GF movie. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The history of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people everywhere in the world. This film has been called an American story, however, I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. In many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
9,"A Timeless Epic of Power, Loyalty, and Betrayal","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is more than just a film; it's a masterclass in storytelling that delves deep into the dynamics of power, loyalty, and betrayal within the Corleone mafia family. Set against the backdrop of post-World War II America, the film weaves a compelling narrative centered around the Corleone family's internal and external struggles as they navigate the treacherous waters of organized crime.

At the heart of the story is Don Vito Corleone, portrayed with an unforgettable gravitas by Marlon Brando. Vito is the epitome of old-world values, a man who commands respect through a mixture of kindness and ruthless enforcement. His refusal to engage in the burgeoning drug trade-a decision based on his moral compass and a vision of the future for his family-sets off a chain of events that threatens the very fabric of the Corleone dynasty.

The opening scene at Vito's daughter's wedding serves as a brilliant exposition of the family's dynamics and the Don's influence. It introduces us to the youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a decorated WWII Marine who initially distances himself from the family's criminal enterprises. Michael's journey is the film's emotional core, a reluctant hero who is drawn deeper into the family's violent world after a series of brutal attacks and betrayals.

As Michael steps into the role he was most reluctant to assume, we witness a transformation that is both tragic and compelling. His evolution from an innocent outsider to a cold, calculating leader is masterfully depicted by Pacino, whose performance anchors the film's exploration of morality and identity.

The clash between Vito's old-world values and the new, ruthless ways of doing business is not just a family conflict but a commentary on the changing face of American society. The Corleone family's struggle is emblematic of a broader transition from traditional honor codes to a more cutthroat, profit-driven ethos. This thematic depth is one of the film's greatest strengths, elevating it above the standard crime drama.

Coppola's direction, combined with Mario Puzo's screenplay, crafts a richly textured world filled with memorable characters, each contributing to the story's intricate tapestry. The supporting cast, including James Caan as the hot-headed Sonny and Robert Duvall as the loyal consigliere Tom Hagen, deliver performances that add layers of complexity to the narrative.

Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a feast for the eyes, with Gordon Willis's cinematography capturing the dark, shadowy essence of the Corleone world. The iconic score by Nino Rota further immerses the audience in the film's melancholic and foreboding atmosphere.

""The Godfather"" is not just a movie about the mafia; it's a profound exploration of family, power, and the often-painful sacrifices made in their pursuit. It's a story that resonates on multiple levels, making it a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences. Whether you're drawn in by its compelling characters, its intricate plot, or its thematic richness, ""The Godfather"" offers a cinematic experience that is both deeply personal and universally relevant."

10,Classic movie,"Life is so beautiful. The plot is very good, but there is a saying that I don't like it. It seems to say that men need to think a lot and bear a lot, but children and women don't. With the feeling that it's a little sexist."

10,Masterpiece,"The best movie in the history in my opinion. Is great, emocional and with excellent performances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The final is epic too."
10,Excellent Movie with awesome climax.,"Excellent movie. This story has been influenced many script writers. They just copied some parts of this movie. And this movie is a lesson for Bachelor science students under Calicut university. My brother read about this movie from his textbook. The best casting was the top highlight. When I was a kid, I found the poster of godfather on cards. But I did not get any idea about it. Some of my friends read the book. From their information, I saw the movie. It was fantastic. And I know there were some immigrants from Italy. And Italian was a common language in some parts of the USA in 1940's and 1950's. The climax was one of the best movies. A different one. Yes, It is copied for new gen movie. And some scenes are still trying to copy. So we can say, This movie is GODFATHER."
10,Perfect,"But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,"
9,Excellent,"It is old, still it has its distinctive aristocratic effulgence!"
10,Old but gold . . .,"I watched this movie very late. You now, there is one quote ""Old but gold"". This is cliche but this quote equals to this movie. Atmosphere, music, actors, actress, cinematography, dialogue, writing, everythink are fantastic.

10 / 10."
9,best movie,"As a film buff, I have always heard of ""The Godfather"" and its incredible impact on the movie industry. So, I decided to finally watch the classic movie for myself and see what all the hype was about. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.

From the very first scene, ""The Godfather"" had me hooked. The storyline was rich with complexity and intrigue, following the powerful Corleone family and their struggle to maintain their hold on their Mafia empire. The film was expertly directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo. The movie takes the viewer through a tumultuous journey of power, family, and betrayal that is both mesmerizing and poignant."

Whether it's acting or the use of lens or music, it gives people a kind of beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely need to sink to savor, and whenever you turn it out, you can have a new feeling."

10,must watch,Amazing movie. I dont know how many times i've watched.
10,Perfection,"There is absolutely nothing wrong I can find in this movie. I've seen it so many times, and it's flawless. Top notch acting, brilliant direction, amazing music, captivating storyline...this movie has it all.

Let's talk about the actors first. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleon and Al Pacino as his son Micheal Corleone pull off the best performances in this movie. That's not to say that the other actors don't deserve recognition; each character is believable and realistic.

I am not going to spoil much of the story; it's fairly simple, but there are a few twists and turns.

The score by Nino Rota is great, and has now become a classic. The main theme is very memorable.

The direction by Francis Ford Coppala is just genius. Each shot is done beautifully. The opening sequence for example, is just great, starting with a close-up of a minor character and slowly zooming out until you see a glimpse of The Godfather. Simply brilliant.

The Godfather is just amazing. If you STILL haven't seen it, rent it, download it, buy it, whatever, just watch it! You won't regret it."
10,Best movie f the decade,"I have seen so many movies but I found Godfather the best in terms of direction, filming and concept as I myself is the Film Director and I have a movie studio with the Name of Wow Now Productions based in New Zealand.

I would recommend to all the great directors to watch this movie to get an epic idea for the future.

This year I am making a full feature film and our last movie won Six international awards.

Looking for great actors who can work in my movie, its a love story based on true incidents.

You can comment here if you are interested.

Thanks for reading this review, hope to get in touch soon."
10,Best film ever.,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."""
8,The Best of the Mafia films,"When I first tried watching this movie, it was 3 AM and I could barely pay attention, and it seemed too long for me to watch. And then I watched Scarface, another very long Pacino movie, and I loved it. That movie helped me get used to long movies, and Pacino movies (it made me a huge fan of Pacino) so I tried The Godfather again, this time renting the newer THX Remastered version (which has great Stereo Sound, by the way) and I watched the whole thing, paying attention all the way through, and I loved it. The key to surviving parts of movies that aren't ""action-packed"" is to pay attention to the background. Soak it all up, the area, the surroundings, sometimes beautiful scenery (in which there is alot of in another great long movie, The Deer Hunter) If you haven't seen this movie, you should, don't be distracted by the ""hype"" the movie recieved which might make you think that's all it is, because all of the hype and spoofs it recieved were due to the magnificence of the film."
10,Everything is Perfect.,"This is the best movie ever. The directing is perfect, the actors are perfect (Marlon Brando, unforgetable acting)the story is beautiful. This movie is just perfect. The final scene is amazing."

A Binge-Watch!"
9,one of the best movies I've ever seen,CLASSIC CRIME MOVIE good actors better director the best crime story I've ever seen.
9,Power is not granted; it's been taken,"Shows powerful men's life. Its not just a movie for quickies. careful watching gives you glimpses of handling creatures of emotion and fear. its not exaggerated. But it is generally applicable in civilized society when leaders have emerged. Another interesting thing is usage of sound. A lot of sound and scenes are composed without dialogues. Light, silhouette, symbols of shadows are heavily used to 'frame' godfather. even you can hear a lot of family sounds without meant for any literal communication to the audience. baby cry, Italian conversations.. Bit lengthy and dialogue oriented. Only watch when you have peaceful time."
8,great lol,"It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.

Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles, a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome dona Carleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze, his smooth gestures, his unique voice and his unforgettable ""bulldog jaw"" forever blended into the image of the viewer.

Don Carleone - this is Marlon Brando - sloven and lover in life, but on the screen - a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone - a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster, who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way. Marlon Brando with his game was able to make the viewer believe that before him is not just an actor playing a role, but a real person is that same severe don. Brando is a great improvisator."
9,True Classic,"The Godfather stands as a monumental achievement in cinema, meriting a resounding 9 out of 10 stars. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this masterpiece effortlessly combines intense drama with a detailed, poignant exploration of family, power, and morality within the Italian-American mafia. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary, offering a character of immense depth and complexity, while Al Pacino's transformative journey as Michael Corleone is a compelling narrative of innocence lost. The film's narrative is both grandiose and intimate, weaving a tale that is as much about the bonds of family as it is about the business of crime. Coppola's direction is meticulous, creating a film that feels both timeless and deeply rooted in its 1940s and 1950s settings. The cinematography is stunning, with Gordon Willis's use of light and shadow contributing to an atmosphere that is both foreboding and inviting. Nino Rota's score further enriches the cinematic experience, embedding itself in the viewer's memory. ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's an indelible part of cultural history, a saga that resonates as strongly today as it did upon its release. A true classic in every sense of the word."
10,The best!,"The Best Movie of all time for me. I've watched many times i will still watch again. The Godfather is an absolute classic that transcends the crime genre. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film delves deep into the world of the Corleone family, exploring themes of power, loyalty, and betrayal. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is legendary, bringing a unique blend of authority and vulnerability to the role. Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a formidable mafia boss is equally compelling. The film's storytelling, character development, and iconic scenes make it a must-watch for any movie enthusiast."
10,absolutely fantastic!,"The Godfather has been and will stay in my heart as one greatest films of it's type(mob). It tells a complete story with background about Vito's unfortunate life as a boy.

I like it!"
10,Best Mafia movie i have ever seen,"The Godfather is the best work of F.F. Coppola and the best mafia movie that you can find, the actors, music, atmosphere, decoration, script, everything in this movie is great and unforgettable! so if you still haven't watched the movie, you should grab your popcorn and get ready to 3 hours of pleasure!"
10,Still learning from this.,"To the day, this movie keeps giving me something new to learn each time I watch it.

Every frame, every camera movement, every line of dialogue, or the lack of, is a lesson on how to setup for a great story.

This brillant masterpiece, it's not only a tale of gangsters, but of family and coming of age to deal with the unspoken role eachone has inside a family.

Each character carefully tought and molded to fit a specific role. This is a movie of human emotions and interactions, of our role in our own social groups, or family groups.

And, above all, a great lesson on how to write a great script.

Not one frame goes wasted on this almost 180 minutes film."
10,"Yes, this movie is all that and beyond","The Godfather is a complicated film, with a really intricate storyline. And it never stops, or slows itself for explanations. This movie just trust that the person watching is smart enough to understand all the non verbal cues. And you see yourself so emocionally invested in the characters and the story itself... It's brilliant."
10,Very good djeihbeisodnebod,The best movie of all time Jebhdieoiecudioe diodbekxjeopwoendbsheiejnendkdoenenejekkekdkrnenene
10,masterpiece!!!,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest,"
10,Masterpiece 🌠✨,"One of the best movies of all time, an absolute masterpiece.

The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.

I love it so much it make every body watching feel the gangster life and feel the action happening.

THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot.

Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be. Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
9,1 of top movies,"One of the top movies... i recommend to watch it.....think deeper, see deeper, seek deeper levels of the movie"
10,GREAT MOVIE!,Love every bit of this movie! Everything and everyone that was involved with it did such an amazing job acting and portraying the mafia and people of that time period!
10,Class,Just pure class. Nothing much to say than the film of all films.
10,Art in a Film,"Its hard to describe the acting in this film, but to me the acting was so artistic that it felt like I was watching moving art in a film metaphorically speaking. Even if you are someone who doesn't like gangster films, I feel like this film can be enjoyed by an audience of any genre. The way the story was acted out and slowly unraveled throughout the movie was beautifully done. My favorite character obviously was The Godfather himself, I can't picture any other actor being able to pull off what Al Pacino did in this film and this is one of the big reasons why is one of my top five favorite actors. This film had everything from romance, action, drama, horror ( in a way). One of the very few movies I ever watched and couldn't think of anything I didn't like about it"
10,It has a significant impact on crime-type movies and has epoch-making significance,"As a classic film, ""The Godfather"" is perfect in storytelling, performance, photography, and movie skills, and can be used as a textbook for movies. As an epic film, the whole story has a huge pattern, a complicated plot, and many characters. There are more than 20 characters who need to be expressed, but the film handles them in an orderly manner. Under Coppola's superb director skills, the characters are distinct in primary and secondary, and the character is full. Some characters only need one lens and one detail to express the character's character."
10,The Godfather of Gangster Movies,"I initially watched this trilogy in a VHS collectors edition that was in time order so most the Godfather 2 came first with De Niro. I loved it then back in the 90's then watched it multiple times as in cinematic release order.

Having just reviewed this on our show we both loved it a true cinematic experience that still stands up to this day. Fantastic"
8,A review you can't refuse,"Yeah, yeah. It's a fine movie. Overlong, but that's only because of the pleasingly languorous pacing. Still, it ain't as good as everybody makes it out to be. And can anybody justify casting Marlon Brando, James Caan, John Savage, and Robert Duvall as the brain-trust of an Italian mob family? (Thank God for Pacino.) The casting director should have been made to sleep with the fishes."
10,ultimate awesome movie,"This isn't fair a delightfully created hoodlum film. Or an exceptional family representation, for that matter. An astounding period piece. A character think about. A lesson in filmmaking and an motivation to eras of on-screen characters, chiefs, screenwriters and makers. For me, this can be more: this can be the authoritative film. 10 stars out of 10."
10,One of the Best,"There have been many great films made. Alien, Life of Brian, Scarface. But only a select few don't bow down to this classic. There is a reason for this. It has a skilled production team. Acting-Some of the best acting I've ever seen. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the world's best two actors. Script-Well written, no weak lines. Score-haunting and desperate, fits the tone of the film. I could go on and on. This film is an absolute classic. Do yourself a favour and watch. Even if you don't like gangster films, this is an essential watch. Sorry if this review is short, but I don't see how endless words can portray how expert this is. Well made to an extent few films have reached or even beaten the level of. This has stood the test of time."
10,AWESOME,"Beautiful. Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful!!! Pure film. Real emotions. This is a classic film that everyone NEEDS to watch. I recommend this to many young filmmakers like myself!"
10,Godfather,"The godfather story provides a terrible source of pleasure rooted in the hearts of americans, giving readers a close-up view of a thrilling dark and violent illegal class and a feast for the reader's dangerous lifestyle. Classic mob story!"
10,A must see,I loved this movie! It kept me tuned in through the whole movie. #LovedIt!
10,Dope Movie,"Great Work!! This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
8,The Godfather,"It insists upon itself, to quote Chris Griffin. It's a Family Guy reference! Do you get it? Pretty clever, huh?

Like this film (upper-crust word for ""movie"") needs another fantastic review from someone who knows little about FILM. Flawless acting, characterization, pacing, writing - it has it all. It's a school book for what a movie (or film, AND film, for that matter) should be. Like a Shakespearean drama it amuses the full range of its audience - the cheap seats get the tawdry mob thriller while the box seats get the upscale shine of an avowed masterpiece. I'm just trying to use the required number of characters, and now I have!"
9,Amazing movie!,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo. It was produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert De Niro. The screenplay by Puzo and Coppola is based on their novel of the same name.

The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been named by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 greatest American films of all time. The film has been re-released several times, most recently in 2002 with an extended cut.

The story is set in the fictional town of Corleone, in the 1920s and 1930s, and follows the family of Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime syndicate. The film portrays the development of the Corleone family from its establishment by Don Vito Corleone in 1922 to his death by his son and successor, Michael Corleone, in 1945.

The Godfather is an intense and dramatic film, with a large cast and detailed storyline. It is not for the faint of heart, and is often considered one of the greatest films of all time.

If you're looking for a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it, The Godfather is the perfect choice. With its intense drama and gripping storyline, it is sure to leave you feeling impressed and entertained. Whether you're a fan of crime films or simply enjoy great drama, The Godfather is definitely worth a watch."
10,Greatest Movie all time?,"Still never gets old, a perfect movie. Everything about this film works on every level"
9,good film,This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
10,Best film ever,"Best film ever, greatest cast, the soundtrack and cinematography.I have seen this movie probably 100 times and each time I capture something new.Marlon Brando is the greatest character and an example of a wise mafia boss.

Al Pacino is a wonderful fit into a coldblooded next in line, showing a great character, amazing charisma, sweet looks and merciless heart.HIs relationship with the brother Freddy after his betrayal is so powerful , specially the words that describe the mafia family values where you never go against your family.

Female character is powerful as well."
10,One Of The Best Films Of All Time,"When one thinks of film masterpiece, ""The Godfather"" is certainly high on the list. I wish my review could have been written in 1972, but today will have to do. Rightly labeled, ""Godfather"" is in the top ten ultimate guy movies of all time. In many circles it is required viewing before labeling yourself a man.

Mario Puzo and Coppola have crafted Americana organized crime mythology. The Godfather story has weaved it's way into society slang, catch phrases and the average person's basic knowledge of the mafia. No matter the other roles the actors in this film bring to life in other great movies, they are never praised so much or remembered so deeply as for ""The Godfather.""

Names of acting royalty such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and more are involved in the ""Godfather"" franchise. The movie, the dialogue, the cinematography are as fresh today as in 1972. Pacino's portrayal of the character of Michael Corleone is film school homework. The appearance of Brando as Don Corleone not only revamped his career but is now a staple for what the head of a mafia family must be like.

Voted in the top ten films of all time by the American Film Institute, ""The Godfather"" is a must see film. Lucky for new film goers and fans alike, the movie is so popular you can catch it on television about once a week. The entire ""Godfather"" trilogy fills the cable airwaves keeping the movie very much in the public eye. If you haven't seen it, but like movies then by all means check your listings. Trust me, I'm making you an offer you can't refuse."
10,One of the Greatest Films of all time,"When I first saw this movie, I was amazed. It became one of my favorite movies of all time. The Godfather is a mix of perfect Directing, Story Telling, and Acting. Marlon Brando of course was great as Don Vito, Al Pacino was awesome as Michael, Robert DuVall, James Caan, James Cazale, and Diane Keaton were all great in this movie. The thing I like most about the movie is that, although it is fictional, it is very accurate on how the Italian Mafia was. I mean the realism of the Crime Family and all the conflicts that they had with other rival Families. Francis Ford Coppolla and Mario Puzo did a awesome job on adapting the original novel to the screenplay. It is just simply magnificent. 10/10."
9,One of the best movies in history of Cinema,This movie blows your mind away with its great cast. This movie is full of emotions and ups and downs. It depicts a father that has the will to do anything to keep his family safe and happy at any cost. It also shows how a man can be so cruel.
10,The Godfather,"Simply the most deep drama i've ever witnessed, my favorite movie of all time, such a beautiful harmony, smooth narration, stunning music and especially outstanding acting by Marlon Brondo. Francis ford Coppola along with the score from Nino Rota delivered the most complete drama experience ever on the big screen.the transition of Mike from a man who defends Honor and law to the completely opposite, driven by the love of his family i watched the movie long time ago when i was very young so i couldn't understand his beauty, i re-watched it more than 2 times now and every time is the same effect, you keep thinking of the story and the act for the coming weeks, Godfather is undoubtedly a rare masterpiece."
10,One of the top movies,"A bit over-glorified as far as ""crime families"" are concerned, nevertheless, acting is top, cinematography is top, and it does have characteristics that made it part of modern Western culture. This movie has no flaws, even as far as its ""message"" is concerned.

I do believe though that it's incomplete without ""part II"" (part III was an appendix). I'm a Mediterranean and I can understand ""why this and why that"", and an American can understand the ""why's"" by watching Part II, then watch Part I again. There are many shades of gray in the personalities of immigrants, especially the most ambitious of them. In the eyes of an American, Part I is a crime movie, but with Part II it also becomes a cultural movie, and the main focus switches from ""crime"" to something more cultural - integration and part of American history, through the story of an Italian family.

Highly recommended to people who would read a book again, and would see a movie again."
9,Plot is amazing,"Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he also wrote with Mario P, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a good look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone. Of course I recommend it!"
9,Best ever!,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that set the standard for storytelling in film. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it explores the intricate dynamics of power, family, and loyalty within the Corleone crime family. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, coupled with Al Pacino's transformation as Michael, is unforgettable. The film's rich narrative, complex characters, and haunting score by Nino Rota create an immersive experience. Its influence on cinema is undeniable, making it a must-watch classic that remains relevant across generations. Gonna admit I didn't expect it to be good."
10,Best Movie Ever,The Godfather is the best movie of all time because it paved the way for cinema for decades and is incredible in its filmmaking craftsmanship.
10,One of the most talked-about films of all-time.,"When somebody approaches a screening of The Godfather, there is naturally going to be a bit of nervousness approaching it, since so many people have called one of the greatest films of all-time. There is a feeling that he will come away with comments like ""It wasn't that great."" or ""That's supposed to be brilliant masterpiece."" Well, I am going to add some more into the hype machine, because the many other raves about The Godfather are true. It is a phenomenal motion picture that deserves its awards, praise and even more. Francis Ford Coppola constructed one of the shining works of the New Hollywood Era and due to the many spoofs that people produce, both in films, television and YouTube, it has stayed in the memories of countless film lovers. Much like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, a viewing of The Godfather is a must for any film aficionado.

Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the most powerful mafia family in America. He is aided by his sons, timid Fredo (John Cazale), violent Sonny (James Caan) and the adopted family lawyer Tom Hagen (Robertt Duvall). His youngest, Michael (Al Pacino), has returned home from serving in the Second World War to attend the wedding of his sister (Talia Shire). Unlike his brothers, he wants nothing to do with the family business and prefers to go into in a clean profession. However, after Vito is shot and wounded, Michael's inner Corleone comes out and he decides to seek revenge on those responsible. He flees to Sicily after doing his job and when he returns, he becomes the new Godfather and one of most powerful men in the mob world.

Every single aspect of The Godfather has been so praised and analysed by many historians and film critics that it will be difficult to construct an original review. Marlon Brando's performance is incredibly etched into our minds and for good reason as it stands as the pinnacle of this great actor's work on film. Newcomer Al Pacino also provided a stunning acting job, making Michael a fascinating character of the Godfather universe and his brilliant work continued to even greater heights in Part II. James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall add more fantastic triumph to the ensemble with their impressive work as the other three Corleone brothers. It's incredibly insane watching their work knowing that Paramount Pictures did not want them for the parts. Coppola's direction and screenplay (which he co-wrote with the book's author Mario Puzo) are also the film's high points along with Nina Rota's brilliant musical score. The Godfather is a fantastic film experience and a masterpiece of cinema that will and can be viewed many times over."
10,My best movie forever,"The Godfather is more than just a movie...a cinematic epic and a measure of artistic and cinematic creativity...the word creativity really does not give the film its full due.

It's the first movie I've given a 10 rating in my life and the only movie I'd give more than a 10 if I could.

I have watched the movie 7 times and I do not mind watching it again because every time there is a different pleasure and a different experience.

The professionalism in acting and integration into the roles in this cinematic work takes you to another world, as if you went back in time to live with the heroes and the story of the film."
10,The first is always best,"1972's ""The godfather"", or to be more exact ""Mario Puzo's The godfather"", was based on his own book and adapted to screenplay by him and the director, Francis Ford Coppola. The movie stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and many others and it received three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Brando which he infamously rejected as a protest directed against misrepresentation of Native Americans in the movies. It was a fine gesture by Marlon considering that I personally would call his character a supporting one and Pacino's Michael was the true lead but that's up for debate.

I'd also add that this movie, in my eyes, marked the final shift from the Old Hollywood to the New Era which can be paralleled with this picture's titular characters. Brando's Vito Corleone is an old patriarch of the family, adored and respected by many and feared by just as many. His son Michael on the other hand is a newcomer, fresh in this world that he has to adjust in and live by its rules. His struggle, his inner battle between what he wants to be and what he has to be in order to protect his family and close ones is the core of the movie and that's why I think of his character as a central, pivotal to the story and plot more than that of Vito's.

What is there to say about ""The godfather"" that hasn't been said too many times already? It is one of the best crime dramas ever; the performances here are top notch, outstanding cinematography, little outdated but not less impressive special effects, fantastic music score by Nino Rota and Mr Coppola's masterful direction bring this motion picture to the hall of the greatest cinema pieces in history and put it onto top shelves with ease."
10,Best movie ever created,Just that i dont need to say anything more its very good of a movie changed my life and put my standars to high now i cant look at any other movie with the same eyes and the same mind.
9,Classic,"The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, music eases faint sorrow, and conflicts of interest and human nature conflict. No matter it is acting, the use of lens, music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie requires a great deal of downtime, and you can have a new feeling whenever you turn it over and revisit it."
10,The greatest !!!,"There are those rare kind of movies that you can watch over and over again. The Godfather is definitely one of those. It's a timeless work of art. Never have I watched a 3 hour movie that had me gripped from start to finish. It's a movie about family, greed, religion, honor where you really feel for the characters. The story is fantastic, the acting superb(especially Marlon Brando), the music, the set pieces... everything comes together in this masterpiece. It's also on of those few old movies that I can watch again and again.

I can't praise this movie high enough. In my opinion the greatest movie of all time!!!"
8,Nice,I think this is great movie even though I haven't watch it (in my watch list)
10,Nothing much the say about this MASTERPIECE,The Godfather movies always special for me im maybe watched this movie 50 times but whenever i watched this movie its like first time im seeing this movie so this masterpiece is had not enough the words say to about you must watch and felling this movie
10,Classic film,"This film, without a doubt, is one of the most popular films in history.

""The Godfather,"" as we all know, is based on an early 70's novel by Italian author Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of one family and it's destiny...the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (the Godfather) is the head of the Corleone family and runs his 1940's New York empire with Mafia justice. The story begins with the wedding of Vito's daughter, Connie, to Carlo Rizzi. Present in the wedding include Vito's sons and heirs, Sanito (""Sonny""), Fredo, and, most famous of all, Michael, the reluctant heir to his father's business.

While the Corleone family is wealthy and fortunate, they also have some rival Mafia families, such as the Tattaglia, Sollozzo, Brasi, and son on and so forth. Tragedy occurs when Vito is injured by the gun of one of the rivals, and thus, a tale of the mafia, bloodshed, and family takes place. ""The Godfather"" chronicles the story of a family trying to stay on top during a dog-eat-dog era, revenge and murder, family and trust, as well as the rise of Michael Corleone as the don (head) of his family and how he avenged his entire family from all rivals.

Puzo's novel was brought to the screen by legendary director Francis Ford Coppolla, whose daughter, Sophia, is now following his footsteps and unleashing her directional legacy with films like ""Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation."" F.F. Coppolla uses his talents to tell Puzo's story through actors and actresses.

Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone and brings a fine Michael Corleone, portraying the his character well. Pacino shows the evolution of Michael from the reluctant young man to this ruthless don and willing godfather like his dad. Diane Keaton also stars in this movie, playing Michael's non-Italian wife, Kay Adams. But, of course, the title role (the Godfather) is given to the recently-deceased legend Marlon Brando. Brando is truly Vito Corleone, bar none, and you better respect him or else.

Other than the actors and actresses, the sets are good, too. This is not a cheery and bright film but a dark and gloomy epic. The grim and gritty 40's-50's NYC sets reflect the brutality of that time, when gangs were the rulers of New York's streets. However, the Corleone family's Italian heritage is also reflected, and who's better in making Italian music than Italian composer, Nino Rota? The Godfather theme song (""Speak Softly, Love"") is just as classic as the film.

""The Godfather"" was released in 1972. It was a critical and commercial success, winning several Oscars, even, best of all, Best Picture. It was followed by 1974's ""Godfather, Part II,"" and 1990's ""Part III."" The first sequel was just as acclaimed as the first while the latter had mixed reviews. But still, all of these films are regardless as classics by critics and the movie-going public. Many consider this film to be the greatest film of all time.

Runningtime 175 mins. (2 hrs. 57 mins.) Rated R for graphic violence"
10,Memorable,"The most memorable movie i have ever seen. I could watch it with my family or anyone, if you're looking for the go-to movie. The godfather should be on your list!!"
10,A true masterpiece,"The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that's very believable. The movie follows the Corleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Corleones refuse to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this go crazy.

The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing but the characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them.

The actors are excellent. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando does a remarkable job and will forever be remembered as Don Corleone. The other actors also deliver a very good performance.

The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is wonderful and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stand out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.

The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that ""this is the 40's"". It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie.

I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there is no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.

There are some special effects in this movie. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but not that much. It is rather good. I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it.

The Godfather is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It is almost a legend. If you like movies, this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it will destroy your impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!"
10,The Godfather of All Crime Films,"This film is the film that started so much. From the color scale to the violence and symbolisms. There is no going wrong with this film. Even though the film has been out for over 40 years, it holds it's own to anything made today.

Anyone who enjoys films should see this film. Hands down.

You will like this film if you like: Any crime films or television shows, like 24, CSI, Casino, The Untouchables, Empire, RockNrolla, Young Guns, etc...

You will not like this film if you like films with vivid colors and bright sunny days. Or if you enjoy romance movies more then violent films. The violence in this film is often done as a point to drive across to the audience.

This film and all films of the trilogy are worth watching."
10,Somewhere in my top ten,"What can I say? This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just because the acting and everything is on point, but because Brando pushes it over the edge. There is no argument about it, Marlon Brando is the greatest actor of all time, and not just because of what he does in this film but for nearly every film he has been in. And his later films are all the better because at that point, he more or less mastered his craft. But yeah, The Godfather is an excellent film. The secret behind it, other than Brando's acting is the story. It isn't a crime story but a tale about a family; most people can not wrap their heads around such a concept."
10,Best Ever,"Pure cinema. The best of the best! Textbook standard of filmmaking, music, cinematography and direction."
10,the godfather,"What can be said about godfather that hasnt already been said,godfather is simply one of best films ever made and a must watch for everyone that shares love for movies,godfather has everything incredible cast and performances ,iconic music,great story and grow of characters and their life in criminal world,quateable dialogue with a lot of strong lessons in life we can learn and overall great direction and filmmaking in every way,godfather is simply a masterpiece and i think that this film will been seen and admired in future by many generations to come and they will love this film as much as we love it today"
10,Absolutely Powetful !! but not the best of all-time,"I'm not a big fan of this masterpiece but I liked almost everything in it, I starting to love it though .. 1st time I've seen it I didn't really like it then re-watched it twice then really released how great this movie is .. one of the problems I had before seeing it that people told me almost daily how great it is and they speak with details sometimes which I believe is a big mistake because they really made feel that like if a miracle is going to happen and change the world as we know while I'm watching it!! besides, the biggest pleasure is to discover all the great things yourself so you can actually feel the greatness instead of faking it or something even if it takes you more than five times to watch it.. just be patient and try to see it as q movie and while you are watching someday you will know for sure how and why it is so great. In my opinion it is great because of Marlon Brando who gave one of the best performances in history of cinema .. the rest of the cast especially Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire did a great job .. Coppola did a great job directing and writing it with Mario Puzo and the music couldn't just be better .. the movie is great but it has also its down points .. so, I doubt it is the best movie of all-time. Enjoy it."
10,One of the best movie.,What a beautiful plot and story and role played by the actors. That's absolutely brilliant.
10,Fantastic movie!,"The film is almost three hours, but you can't call it long, making it two hours long would have turned out to be a stump that would have lost its value. In three hours, a whole life unfolded on the screen with all its charms and blows. We can see how people change over time. And what previously seemed alien, wrong in an instant becomes everything in a person's life. As I said, a film of incredible depth, to conquer which you need to see the story to the end.

10 of 10."

OVERALL:"
9,For me,"The Godfather is the best movie of all time. First of all, it is the best book adaptation ever made. In my opinion, the opening scene is the most successful opening scene in the history of cinema, and the character of Vito Corleone became a legend with this scene, in my opinion. Especially the improvisation and inclusion of the cat in the script at the last minute adds a completely different flavor to this exquisite film. This movie is actually a family drama, because the subject is Vito Corleone and the ""concept of family"" that he cares about more than anything else. The soundtrack is already one of the best movie soundtracks ever, with a quality that even surpasses the movie itself from time to time."
10,Best movie ever!,I have seen this movie over 20 times and I still enjoy it. Best movie ever!
9,Awesome Movie of its Genre,"If the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.Film is extremely effective in conveying Gangster's Life. Must watch Film of its Genre.The Support cast did fantabulous job .The scenes which look so tough were so easily portrayed.This kind of film is an instant hit among audience.Suspense drama folds according to time."
8,I liked this movie!!!!!,"If you're wondering why I put exclamation points after the headline, it's because I thought this movie was just another overrated pile of junk. Man was I wrong! This movie was quite good. Sure it isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely in my Top 250! This should definitely replace boring THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as #1 in the Top 250. It's about the Corleone family's criminal empire run by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and trying to pass it on to his son Michael (Al Pacino) You shouldn't watch this movie if you are under age 16 though. It's quite violent and no one under that age would understand it anyway. Definitely watch this movie. It is very well done.

8.5/10 or: B"
9,The godfather,I think the godfather is one of the greatest movie of all time and that's a #fact

10,cinematic genius,"Forever one of my all time favorites... Top 10 movies in my library. Michael Corleone: Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to a personal services contract with this big-band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. But the band leader wouldn't let him. Now, Johnny is my father's godson. So my father went to see this bandleader and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day, my father went back, only this time with Luca Brasi. Within an hour, he had a signed release for a certified check of $1000. Kay Adams: How did he do that? Michael Corleone: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay Adams: What was that? Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract....... Thats a true story. Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract. Thats a true story."

10,All-time best movie,"My all-time best movie. Excellent movie to watch, find time and enjoy"
10,Masterpiece,This is the perfect example of how to transform a story from book to script to screen. No derail spared no character left unexplored and no thread of story left unanswered. All the cast performed magically and this is one of them rare occasions when a movie literally outdoes any review. Brando Pacino Duvall Caan all deliver performances of a life time and bring to the screen one of the most powerful portrayals of how the mob is a family and that family is Corleone.

10,web hosting,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. Clouduck. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as."
10,Amazing!,A film with a solid structure that is still relevant to contemporary audiences.
10,One of the Greatest Motion Pictures of All Time,"This is the movie that introduced me to my adulthood. At 19 years old, when I first seen The Godfather Trillogy back in 2013, I was enlightened to what film making was all about. In my own words, film is created to mirror society and to broaden your experiences while living on this earth through the moving motion pictures. What I experienced through this film was how to respect family morals, different contrast to business behavior, and most importantly how to discern who to trust. This film tells a thorough storyline from beginning to end. It's not just a mobster movie, but a family and business movie as well that journey's you through the never ending trials and tribulations that can come with working with a family business. If you haven't seen this franchise yet, don't let me spoil it for you, you can watch it for yourself."
10,about a love,"This is not an ordinary movie related to the mafia, this is a lesson for life, which has really been full of different meanings for me watching it deeply many times.

Actors who can only be praised I am glad that I was born in a period where I could watch the Godfather trilogy This movie should be on the list of the top 250 movies of history, it should also be on the list of the best movies ever made on the planet.

No comment can be given on this item in this list except for definition.

Thank you very much for the existence of such actors and directors.

We hope that at least one such movie will be made again in the future."
10,The undisputed greatest movie of all time (NO SPOILERS),"I watched this movie about a year ago, since then I can't get this movie out of my head. The story is very well done and in the middle of the movie the story just sinks you in so you literally can't take your eyes off the movie. When I watched the movie for the first time I was still looking at the screen despite the movie being over, and I was almost paralyzed in my seat. My brother even had to shut the movie down for me, I even had trouble walking.

This movie has the best cast of all time. Al Pacino, Marlon brando and Robert Duvall. It's a miracle they were able to get such good actors for this movie and gave their life performance to it. 4 actors of this movie got oscar nominated for their role which is insane.

Movies like this doesn't get made anymore, if you have not watched the godfather previously then please take popcorn with you, and most importantly, make sure you watch the movie on a TV with good quality and popcorn."
10,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"If there is a movie better than this then I have yet to see it.There isn't really a word to describe how good this movie actually is!! from start to finish this movie has you staring at the screen in amazement.No actor in this film lets it down and was shown by the academy awards when the best actor category was filled with actors from the godfather,never in history has that happened."
10,A great movie,"This movie has it all, great acting by Marlon Brando and James Caan, great characters, the same two, and great action and story. The aspect that carries this movie is the great acting by Marlon Brando that totally gets you into the Don Corleone character and introduces you to the world of the mafia and all of their families."
8,Classic thriller,Excellent film with great acting. Keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time. Wonderful production qualities.
10,BEST FIRM FOR EVERY REAL MAN IN THE WORLD,"As one delves into the cinematic masterpiece that is ""The Godfather,"" it becomes apparent that it transcends mere entertainment to become a testament to the essence of masculinity and power. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, this film has not only stood the test of time but has also solidified its place as a cornerstone of cinematic history.

At the heart of ""The Godfather"" lies a narrative rich in themes of loyalty, family, and the pursuit of power. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of iconic, exuding a commanding presence that demands respect and reverence. Brando's performance captures the complexities of a patriarch torn between duty and the consequences of his actions, setting the tone for the film's exploration of morality and honor.

The film's meticulous attention to detail, from its intricate plot to its rich character development, is a testament to Coppola's directorial prowess. Every scene is crafted with precision, drawing the audience into the clandestine world of organized crime while simultaneously humanizing its characters.

""The Godfather"" is not merely a tale of mobsters and violence; it is a reflection of the inherent struggles of manhood. Through the lens of the Corleone family, the film explores the sacrifices men make in the pursuit of power and the toll it takes on their personal lives. From the stoic resolve of Michael Corleone (played masterfully by Al Pacino) to the volatile nature of Sonny (James Caan), each character grapples with their own interpretation of masculinity within the confines of their world.

What sets ""The Godfather"" apart from its contemporaries is its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. Its themes of loyalty, honor, and the quest for power are universal, transcending cultural and temporal boundaries. Whether it's your first viewing or your tenth, ""The Godfather"" continues to captivate and enthrall, leaving an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape.

In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's a rite of passage for every man who seeks to understand the complexities of power and masculinity. With its timeless narrative and unforgettable performances, it remains the definitive cinematic experience for those who appreciate the finer nuances of storytelling."
10,Fer à boucler,"I will wrote my Review in french best movie ever.

Ce film est le meilleur film de l'histoire du cinéma. Un casting de rêve, des sentiments peints et dépeints, une maîtrise musicale et photographique. Le chef d'oeuvre."
10,Superb,"It's the best trilogy ever made, considering the time. Very complex and with an outstanding soundtrack and performances."
8,The best movie,"Dad is one of the best movies I've seen. In addition to being successful as a cinematographer, he has also been successfully adapted from his book. Although Marlon Brando exhibited his best father performance, Al Pacino showed a better father performance. The film was a political analysis of that period, when the American filmmaker was very good at describing that period. the first film is perfect as well as it is still so beautiful in the film. but the third movie is a little unsuccessful. everyone is an excellent masterpiece that can be recommended. good looking..."
10,Family Business,"I've been in the rare position as a cinephile to have never watched The Godfather. I've been in the even rarer position of being an Italian-American cinephile that has never watched The Godfather. That has now thankfully changed. I can cross off my bucket list, at least, the first installment of this treasured film franchise. To millions, it's the greatest film of all time. To filmmakers and film lovers, the experience alone is a pilgrimage. To Italians in America, it's a vital piece of our history, for better or worse. It's an epic tragedy about absolute power, vengeance, violence as a means to an end and the traditions of a family through generations. Vito Corleone passes it all down to his son, Michael and with it, the price of his soul. But to Michael, there is no price. His soulless brown eyes say it all. He's fully consumed by power by the film's end. It's corrupting influence be dammed. I could go on, but frankly, I don't need to. The Godfather speaks for itself."
10,Good,"I really like this movie and have seen it many times, even in 2020."
10,One of the best,"Definitely my favourite movie, great acting a use of colours."
10,people who are narrow minded should stick to dull pointless special effects movies and not try to comment on such masterpieces as the godfather,"It breaks my heart to see poeple knock around the godfather and think to themselves that the general public goes along with them. Those who say the Godfather has bad acting, too long, pointless, badly directed and boring should take a look at the movies we see today. Instead of knocking around a masterpiece (which does deserve a place in the top 100 movies at the top ten not scream or something along those lines) just go listen to your pointless death metal music. One person said they couldn't find the link between a masterpiece and the movie. He said it had a great plot and excellent acting but he must've had a mind block for anything else. I'll tell you what else the music, cinematography, presentation, the script, the book it was based on and how well it was adapted. Now alot of people say that goodfellas is better. Sure its very entertaining and puts a glorified twist on the world of the mafia but it aint no masterpiece. I'll tell you what's boring star wars without all the special effects."
10,Art of portrait,"America, American, Americans, American italian,american italian don,american italian don of crimes, american italian don of organized crimes with a spectacular screenplay and wonderful portait of characters in 1970's ,I saw that film in 2019 it's mesmerizing."
10,"Greatest movie ever, fabulous","This is absolutely the greatest movie ever, together with part 2 en 3 :-) The only vote i can give is (triple) 10. Great actors too, never saw a movie that was so fascinated then this one's about the story of the Corleone's. Even the flashbacks and the early 10's, 20's 30's are masterpieces. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece. Great that they made a part 3 years later with a good role from Andy Garcia."
9,"That's my family, it's not me.....","This film is considered a real classic of cinema, is it the greatest film of all time? Let's see. The 1940s setting is wonderfully recreated here in the fashions, the cars, the interior set decorations. The film all is a very good looking one, I loved the colours, the textures, the use of shadow. This is a long film, and I did think the wedding scene goes on too long. The film also gives us both an inside and outside perspective on the family using various techniques. Certain lines have become iconic and I also enjoyed the fact that there was some great character development. Our main character's instance that he is not his family starts to ring hollow as he becomes increasingly drawn into their murky world. Power corrupts too in this movie and I loved the performances in this film, they are so much more subtle than you might think. I thought that James Caan is brilliant in this movie, the sun drenched photography when the story also moves to Italy looks gorgeous. The soundtrack in this film is also something you cannot associate with anything other than this genera. While the film is technically superb it's really the deep theme within this movie that leave the most lasting impression."
10,Best film for ever,This is start & end of the Cinema This is best film of Marlon Brando Al Pacino!
9,Awesome,"**Title: A Timeless Masterpiece: The Godfather (1972)**

The Godfather (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic tour de force that remains unparalleled in its portrayal of the dark, intricate world of organized crime. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, the film intricately weaves a tale of power, loyalty, and betrayal within the Corleone family.

Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the patriarch whose presence dominates the screen with quiet authority and commanding charisma. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant, innocent Michael Corleone to a ruthless mob boss is executed with remarkable subtlety and depth, showcasing his extraordinary range as an actor.

Coppola's direction, combined with Nino Rota's haunting score and Gordon Willis's masterful cinematography, creates an atmosphere of tension and elegance that immerses the audience completely. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing characters and relationships to develop organically, making the inevitable descent into violence and moral ambiguity all the more impactful.

The supporting cast, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, each contribute powerful performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative. The Godfather is not merely a crime saga but a profound exploration of family dynamics, honor, and the American Dream's dark side.

Over fifty years since its release, The Godfather endures as a benchmark of excellence in filmmaking, its influence evident across genres and generations. It's a must-watch for anyone seeking a deep, gripping story told with unparalleled artistry."
10,Real Masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is perhaps one of the most iconic and timeless films in cinema history. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, the film follows the Corleone crime family as they navigate the ruthless underworld of organized crime in New York City.

The film opens with a lavish wedding celebration for the Corleone family's youngest daughter, Connie. At the wedding, we are introduced to the patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone, portrayed flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando's performance as Vito is perhaps one of the most iconic in cinema history. He exudes both the charm and the menace that is required of his character, and his performance lingers in the mind of the viewer long after the credits have rolled.

The film follows the Corleone family through a period of conflict as they face internal struggles and external threats. The main conflict centers around the transfer of power from Vito to his son, Michael, played by a young and relatively unknown Al Pacino. Michael begins the film as an outsider to the family business, but as the violence mounts and trusted family members are betrayed, Michael is forced to take on a more active role in the organization.

The supporting cast of ""The Godfather"" is equally impressive, with standout performances from James Caan as hotheaded Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton as Michael's love interest, Kay Adams.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Godfather"" is the attention to detail paid by Coppola and the film's production team. The film is set in the 1940s and 50s, and every element of the film, from the costumes to the set design to the music, is meticulously crafted to transport the viewer back in time. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is particularly memorable, with its haunting melody lingering in the mind long after the film has ended.

""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece of cinema, a film that has stood the test of time and continues to captivate audiences decades after its initial release. Its themes of family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power make it a timeless classic that remains relevant to this day. Whether you are a fan of gangster films or simply appreciate a great story, ""The Godfather"" is a must-see film that should be added to every movie lover's list."
10,Benchmark for a movie crew,"This movie is flawless, it's benchmark for the movie industries of this world, new upcoming celebrities follow this movie..."
9,RIP Gordon Willis,"The late great Gordon Willis changed cinematographer forever in this classic film. Ordinarily during this time, an eye light was routinely used on the lead actor in order to better expose the eyes: an important part of the performance. To the dismay of the studio executives, Willis decided to let Marlon Brando's eyes fall into shadow, creating an ominous cinematographic look that is indelibly inscribed into the consciousness of filmmakers. Since his contribution to cinematography, we now embrace a much more naturalistic approach to lighting which has allowed for interesting photography to flourish.

Rest in Peace, Gordon Willis."
10,"cruel, crude, chaotic, corrupt, complex and complicated movie yet also cool, clever, colorful with a sense of charity and compassion","Flawless! From casting, directing, storyline and acting, this cinematic masterpiece exceeds every norm of past motion picture experience and creates its own. Up to this day i still strive to find a movie to rival such a magnificent work of art.

What ought to be just a Mafia thriller became ""the Mafia Thriller"", imitated up until today by many who wish to follow in the footsteps of this great classic.

As for cultural significance, this film does not fall short either. It towers above every other movie in this category which is why i consider it the greatest movie of all time.In fact, it has inspired a generation of mainstream moviegoers and movie aficionados alike. It is a once in a lifetime movie to say the least.

Yes, there are other very entertaining movies such as the Shawshank Redemption etc. but many of these failed to cross the boundary of being just a movie nerd flick to mainstream acclaim. The Godfather has captured both sides of the coin, setting it apart from the other cult favorites.

It captures a wide range of emotions and characteristics.

All in all, The Godfather is a cruel, crude, chaotic, corrupt, complex and complicated movie yet also cool, clever, colorful with a sense of charity and compassion diverging from the common contemporary clichéd convention of conservative customary classic films."
8,Great movie,Big al pacino fan one of the best actors in the world
9,Amazing,I truly Like It!! It is one of my favourite one!! Beautifully scripted
10,It's just a Great,One of the best movie I have ever seen in my life.. #Done
9,The Godfather: A Timeless Masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a cinematic tour de force that has captivated audiences since its release in 1972. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, the film delves into the intricate dynamics of the Corleone crime family, offering a rich tapestry of drama, power, and betrayal. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, embodying the complex blend of menace and charisma that defines the character. Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone is equally compelling, capturing his transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless mob boss.

Coppola's direction, combined with Gordon Willis's evocative cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score, creates an atmosphere of brooding intensity that underscores the film's exploration of family loyalty and moral ambiguity. The Godfather is not just a crime drama but a profound meditation on the nature of power and corruption. Its influence on cinema is profound, cementing its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
10,INCREDIBLE MOVIE,"It's an incredible movie with a powerful story about family, power, and loyalty. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is unforgettable, and Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone, goes through a dramatic change that makes the movie really interesting to watch.

The film is beautifully made, with strong acting, great dialogue, and amazing music that fits the mood. Every scene feels important, and the way the story builds up keeps you hooked. The themes of respect, betrayal, and power are handled in a deep and thoughtful way. A must to watch story that will makes you want to watch more."
10,The Best Ever!,"I love this movie, this is on my list along with ""Good Fellas"" and ""Scarface""."
10,"""The Godfather"": a masterpiece of nuances and power","Reflecting on ""The Godfather,"" it's hard not to feel immersed in a cinematic experience that transcends mere entertainment. This film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, is much more than a mafia story; it's a meditation on family, power, and morality. Every time I revisit it, I discover new nuances and details that make me appreciate the work even more. The plot follows the Corleone family, one of the most powerful mafia families in New York, led by the charismatic and feared Don Vito Corleone, masterfully portrayed by Marlon Brando. Don Vito is a complex character, blending brutality and compassion in an unsettling balance. His presence dominates the film, but it's the journey of his son Michael, played by a young and intense Al Pacino, that provides the emotional backbone of the story. Michael starts as an outsider to the family business, but slowly gets drawn into the criminal world, transforming from a reluctant war hero to a ruthless mafia boss. One of the most memorable scenes for me is the wedding scene that opens the film. It's a masterpiece of visual storytelling, introducing the main characters and their dynamics in a natural and fluid way. The music, the laughter, and the whispered conversations in the corridors create a festive atmosphere that magnificently contrasts with the shadow of violence looming over everything. Coppola uses this scene to set the tone of the film, showing how family life and criminal affairs are inseparably intertwined. The cast is simply extraordinary. Besides Brando and Pacino, we have James Caan as Sonny, the fiery and impulsive elder brother, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the family's Irish-American consigliere. Each actor brings depth and credibility to their role, making the Corleone family feel alive and palpable. Even minor characters, like Fredo, played by John Cazale, and Kay, Michael's girlfriend played by Diane Keaton, add layers of complexity to the narrative. Coppola's direction is meticulous and rich in detail. Every shot is carefully crafted, every camera movement serves a purpose. I've always been struck by the use of chiaroscuro and shadows, reflecting the duality of the characters and their actions. The restaurant shooting scene, with Michael killing Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, is a perfect example of tension built through direction and editing. The deafening silence, the ticking of the clock, the distant sound of the train - everything contributes to creating a breathtaking moment of suspense. Nino Rota's soundtrack is equally iconic. The music of ""The Godfather"" is both elegant and melancholic, capturing the essence of the Corleone family and their world. Each musical theme is associated with a specific character or emotion, amplifying the impact of the scenes. Despite its length, the film never loses its pace. Every scene is necessary, every dialogue carries weight. Subplots, like the rivalry with other mafia families and Michael's tragic love story in Sicily, seamlessly intertwine with the main narrative. Every decision, every action has consequences that ripple through the entire family, making the story gripping and full of suspense. If I were to rate ""The Godfather,"" it would undoubtedly be a 10. It's one of those rare films that manages to be perfect in almost every aspect - from acting to direction, from screenplay to soundtrack. But beyond its technical perfection, what truly makes it extraordinary is its ability to touch on universal themes through a particular story. It's a film about power, loyalty, love, and loss in a way that resonates deeply with the viewer. ""The Godfather"" is not just a masterpiece of cinema, but a work that continues to influence and inspire. Every viewing offers new discoveries, new moments of reflection. It's a journey into the dark heart of humanity, told with a beauty and mastery that remain unmatched. If you haven't seen it yet, it's an experience worth having. And if you've already seen it, you know well that it's a film you always come back to with pleasure."
10,with great justice.......this movie is the best of all time.,"Is completely unimportant any of my comments on this film. But I will say this:

Francis Ford Coppola's's ""The Godfather"" is perfection beyond imagination. For any film to be timeless it has to have every element. And this one has it all. Incredible acting from Brando, Pacino, James Can, Duvall, and everyone else. Character growth from the main leads. Superb cinematography, lighting(IT kind of reminds me of the dark subject matter from many paintings from Loenardo Da Vinci)editing, sound etc. This film will be an example for generations to come of how Films should be done. Without any kind of restrictions and fear."
10,"It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business","When I went to watch this movie the first thing I thought was ""Everyone talks so well about this movie so it's either going to be really good movie or an okay movie that is highly overrated."". Both of the options were wrong. This is not an overrated film and it isn't just a really good movie, it's a almost perfect movie. The only default of this movie is a scene where a character is beating the other up and it's very clear that the punches aren't landing. But it's such a minor default compared to everything other thing that this movie does perfectly, plus at time it was really hard filming those type of scenes without looking like they aren't actually landing punches. The acting, the script, the direction everything on this movie is perfect. And I don't get why people complain about it being long since the movie is so well done that you don't even feel the time passing. Perfect movie to to bottom, I highly recommend."
10,"In my opinion, it is the best movie","I think that the topic, characters, settings... etc all parts of this movie is excellent! I can watch this movie 10000 times. Main character describes some truths about the world! I gave 10 start out of 10. I will watch this movie with my grand grand children :) Firstly people think that it is only a gangster film but it is more than this. It includes the reality of the world, it gives details about the life! Other characters also have a good role play but main character will not be forgotten in the future i think. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt."
10,Must watch,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the world of the Corleone crime family. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation from innocent son Michael to ruthless mob leader are unforgettable. The film's intricate plot, compelling characters, and memorable dialogue set a high bar for the crime genre. Its exploration of power, loyalty, and family remains unparalleled. With its haunting score and impeccable direction, ""The Godfather"" is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences. Must watch."
10,The Classic,"This is it. This is the original. Every other crime/mafia film made after this, was based upon this film. That is what this classic did for the art of film making. Before this, every crime movie tried to capture and display events. Francis Ford Coppola brought us into the life and captured the spirit and tradition of the Corleone family.

Film/Art classes at colleges and universities spend years analyzing and dissecting this classic. We honor the novelist Mario Puzo as well as Coppola for their brilliant screenplay. Coppola also for his directing of this film and series, which has no equal. Here, almost 50 years later, film makers of all genres still kiss the ring of The Godfather. Every member of the cast and crew are still held as legends for the work contributed to this masterpiece.

For those who have not seen this movie or have watched it recently for the first time, and wonder why we hold this film in such high regard. This set the standard that every serious artist/ film maker/writer hopes to achieve. This film alone changed the definition of what acting truly is, something tangible that can be felt through the screen. It made the term respect, not just a way of talking, but about how one carried themselves. A blockbuster before the word ever existed, it showed that film could carry such raw emotion, that you didn't simply watch it, you experienced it. A film score, which when heard can instantly transport you to another time and place. This is The Godfather."
10,Bravo! A genuine work of art--a true masterpiece.,"I never grow tired of this motion picture, with its brilliant dialogue, its powerful characters, and its impeccable direction. This is one of the greatest films of all time, and will likely remain as such forever. Absolutely timeless."
10,A True Classic,"The first time I saw this movie was not too long ago. Coming into the movie I'd heard lots of little things about the Godfather movies (mainly I and II). Most, if not all, of my friends told that the second Godfather movie was better than the first. I couldn't say anything then having seen neither, so I decided to see both. After seeing both, my humble opinion is that the first one IS better than the second; however they're both very good movies.

I liked both movies for their tremendous acting. Both boasted Al Pacino, John Cazale, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. The second had Robert De Niro's Academy Award winning role as Vito Corleone. The first one had James Caan and, one of my favourite performances of all time, Marlon Brando as the older and wiser Don Vito Corleone which is shared by De Niro. Because Brando won the Academy Award for his acting, the character Vito Corleone holds a record for being the only character to have received two Academy Awards; shared by no one. I think what made the first movie for me was Marlon Brando.

There's no way in the world to tell whether the first Godfather is better than The Godfather Part II. Leonard Maltin finds the second one better, I find the first better. The only opinion that really counts is one's opinion to themselves. I highly recommend everyone who hasn't yet to see the Godfather trilogy (primarily I and II, I haven't seen III yet.) They're good movies that shouldn't be missed to anyone."
9,Great!,"Amazing movie picture! I advise everyone to watch. A wonderful storyline, American cinema, as always, surprises with a masterpiece. Emotions are still after the movie!"
10,The bible of Mafia movies,There is nothing to say about this masterpiece man can only watch and let themselves get lost into it.
10,A masterpiece. Best. Film. Ever.,"I'm not too good at elaboration, so I'll keep this short and sweet - The Godfather is quite simply the greatest film ever made. Superb cast, superb acting, superb filming, superb directing, superb story...if you watch this film your life will be bettered. Al Pacino's career best performance, Marlon Brando's career best performance, and superb supporting turns from James Caan, Robert Duvall et al ensure that Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film will forever go down as a classic, the greatest film ever. Based on the classic novel ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo. I advise that you read that - it's absolutely fantastic, and the film stays nigh on 100% faithful to the novel. Go watch. Now."
10,Best Movie,"It's one of those movies that just sticks with you long after the credits roll. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, it's a real masterpiece.

The story takes you deep into the world of the Corleone family, led by the iconic Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando. From the get-go, you're drawn into this gripping tale of power, loyalty, and tough choices.

What's incredible about ""The Godfather"" is how it makes you feel for these characters who are living in this world of crime. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito is legendary - you can't take your eyes off him. And Al Pacino as Michael Corleone? He really brings this conflicted character to life.

But it's not just the acting that's amazing. The attention to detail in every scene, from the sets to the music, is just spot on. You can tell a lot of love went into making this movie.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" isn't just a film - it's an experience. Whether you're into crime dramas or not, it's one of those movies everyone should watch at least once. Trust me, you won't regret it."
10,Good,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film tells the story of the powerful Corleone family and their involvement in the world of organised crime.

The acting in this film is nothing short of incredible. Marlon Brando gives a career-defining performance as Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family. Al Pacino also shines as Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, who becomes increasingly involved in the family's criminal activities as the film progresses.

In addition to the outstanding acting, The Godfather is a beautifully shot film that captures the essence of 1940s New York City. The cinematography and use of lighting create a moody, atmospheric tone that perfectly complements the film's themes of power, loyalty and family.

One of the most impressive things about The Godfather is its ability to balance intense violence with deep emotional moments. The film's infamous horse head scene is still shocking to this day, but it's balanced by quieter scenes such as Michael's conversation with his father about why he doesn't want to get more involved in the family business.

Overall, The Godfather is an absolute must for any film lover. It's a masterclass in storytelling, acting and filmmaking that has rightly earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
10,the most well done movie ever,I think you prolly get it from my title that i love this movie. it is by far my favorite movie ever. i have seen this movie at least 50 times and i will watch it so many more.
10,A almost perfect movie,"One of the greatest movies ever made. Great acting, superb story, great music, and visually stunning. I have seen this movie about five times and it never gets old."
10,Do I even need to do this?,"This is a masterwork of a film. Completely and absolutely the greatest movie ever created. In fact, it is so incredibly perfect, I don't even need to go any further. Nothing went wrong. Rent, buy, see it. No matter how, it's eternally enjoyable. There is no more quotable, or enjoyable film. Anywhere."
10,In the Top 5 greatest films ever made!,"The Godfather Saga is the best story ever. With respect to George Lucas and his Star Wars series, There is nothing better then a story about money, power, and respect in an American setting. The series starts with Part 1, The Godfather, which is in the same category with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Searchers, and Schindler's List as the best movie of there respected Genres. As good as Marlon Brando is in this film, I think that his best film was On the Waterfront and this is his last goodbye. I realize that Last Tange in Paris was a great performance, but the Godfather was an icon for generations to come. Al Pacino in this film is absolutely superb and he only made it better in Part II. Many people put The Godfather as the number 1 movie of all time and I can't argue with that because of all that it has to offer. I think that Citizen Kane is more of a landmark because of all the things that Orson Welles brought to cinema from that movie, but if that is number 1, than Coppola has no shame in being the best number 2 of all time. The amazing thing about the Godfather Saga is that I think the world of Part 1, but I think that Part 2 is better. Bravo Francis, you have made your mark on Film forever, no doubt."
10,"For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","\The Godfather (1972) is one of the greatest films ever made. It is an iconic classic that has been revered and loved by fans for decades. The film follows the rise of the Corleone family in the 1940s and 1950s and the struggles they face with the criminal underworld. The story is compelling and the performances are outstanding, particularly Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is masterful and the cinematography by Gordon Willis is breathtaking. The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinema that should not be missed. It is a film that will stay with you forever. Highly recommended."
10,The Godfather,"The Godfather if you don't know is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It's brilliant! Brando is great. Pacino is great. De Niro is great. Duvall is great. Sonny is great (although I don't know his name). In fact all the Corleones are great along with all the cast. I'm commenting on all three of the movies as a saga as they're all superb but part 2 is something else as many people agree. You may think I go hard when commenting on this trilogy but seriously, it's excellent. I definitely recommend you to own a copy of The Godfather at least and I'm disappointed that I wasn't born when the movies were released as they would've been quality cinema I think."
9,Great...,"This film is solid, great script, extraordinary throwing, magnificent acting, and over the top coordinating. It is difficult to find a film done this well, it is 29 years of age and has matured well. It is difficult to find a film done this well, it is 29 years of age and has matured well. Regardless of the possibility that the viewer dislikes mafia sort of motion pictures, he or she will watch the whole film, the groups of onlookers is stuck to what will happen next as the movie progresses. It is about, family, devotion,voracity, connections, and genuine living.This is an extraordinary mix, and the artistic style makes the film unforgettable..."
9,aspects of movie,"The Godfather product of 1972 is one of the leading movies in drama & crime in the history of cinema. which effects the movies until this time by it's own well performed space.

the time that the film take place in is 1945 till 1955 (after world war II) when crime too a new face in history of america. every things is shown where needs to be shown without any deduction in it's heavy scene. which create many unforgettable pictures in peoples mind

movie shows mainly the conflict between powerful & powerless & people who wants to use & bear it's burden, and how power changes people. and many chessboard characters involved as subordinated role in this movie which are in goes and comes & makes the movie even a lot more heavier with essence & content. the messages in the movie is like ones in the real world. audience is mainly chosen to pick the message on their own"
10,Truly awe-inspiring...,"I cannot add anything about this movie that hasn't already been said by people a lot more experienced about movies than I am.

I can say this though. Few movies have ever grabbed my attention and not let go like this one has. Look at the expression on Al Pacino's face when he tells his brother never to take sides against the family again. There is no doubt about the enormous anger he is fighting to control or about what the results will be if he ever loses that control. Look at Marlon Brando as the reserved dignified old Don spending his last moments playing like a child with his grandson in the garden. And look at Robert Duval when Sal pleads for the favor of his life after he has turned traitor to Michael. And last, look at Dianne Keaton in the last scene when she realizes the her husband IS the Godfather.

These are the things that make a movie great. Standout moments of acting by those who define acting. These are the moments that elevate acting to an art form (and film is just as much an art form as painting or music or poetry). This movie is FILLED with just such moments."
10,Good movie,"A very well created movie, I love it, I hope they continue to get more movies like that."
10,The Godfather: A Film That Stays With You,"The Godfather (1972) is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends time. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful, crafting a world of organized crime that is both captivating and terrifying. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic, delivering a performance that is both menacing and sympathetic. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is equally brilliant, showing the transformation of a reluctant heir into a ruthless leader.

The film's pacing is deliberate, building tension and suspense with each scene. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" becoming instantly recognizable. The score by Nino Rota is haunting and unforgettable, perfectly capturing the film's atmosphere of power and danger.

The Godfather is not just a gangster film; it's a complex exploration of family, loyalty, and the corrupting nature of power. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you pondering its themes and characters.

If you haven't seen The Godfather, it's a must-watch. It's a cinematic experience that will stay with you for a lifetime."
9,A complicated and treasured accomplishment,"There are few films that require the level of attention that ""The Godfather"" does, which in turn urges to the viewer to set aside time to experience the film rather than stumble upon it. Though 1972 presents its own limitations with visual effects, transitions, and sound, Francis Ford Coppola's cohesive storytelling stands above everything else. The script is overwhelmingly rich and could have easily dulled the attention of the viewer, but because of Coppola's understanding and care for the source material this screenplay has endured over 50 years of new stories and revolutionary technology and has cemented itself among the rarities of film history. As animated an actor as Al Pacino is, he presents an incredibly calm demeanor with this character which is fitting for his particular arc among a cast as dominant and erratic as they may seem. By pulling off the bulldog look that he wanted with a dental mouthpiece, Marlon Brando's dialogue mashes up a bit but doesn't restrain him from expressing patience in his mannerisms to provoke an empathetic authority so unique and definitive to the power his character possesses. With a compilation of many near-perfect standalone sequences, the story weaves through an array of dense anxiety, charming interactions, and unpredictable outcomes. This film acts as a blueprint for countless films to follow, highlighting the vital balance between sharing a detailed story and including a range of characters worth investing in. The contrast of brutality and loyalty blend seamlessly together in one of Hollywood's most complicated and treasured accomplishments of all time."
10,Amazing Film,"I watched and so Amazing Film.

10,A classic everyone is familiar with and changed the history of cinema for ever,"The godfather is the pinnacle of movies,its flawless with an absolutely amazing performance by Marlon Brando, the godfather is the godfather of movies, forever a classic that changed cinema"
10,The greatest gangster movie of all time!,"The Godfather in my mind is also one of the greatest movies of any genre, Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece.worthy of preservation by the National Film Registry, and won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay. This film has a large, brilliant cast of actors, most notably Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan, who arguably gave the most memorable performances of their careers. The Godfater stands alone, and is a classic in the true sense of the word."
10,The weight of the inheritance.,"I could find several parts what the mafia philosophy and the manly sentiments are. The words become like a wet blanket in the face of these great images. I always felt what a romantic life of the man is every time I touch in such great masculinity.

Although the Corleone family is a criminal organization, they have their own rules and behave themselves coherently. This is the reason I feel they are awesome. They act cool-headed, but I feel the charity and the warmth of humanity at the same time. The man with the coherence is absolutely cool.

The god father's back told us their philosophy and the manly sentiments were. Michael was gradually piling himself on his father's back. The dignity of mafia should reflect to 'the brand image.'

I got a goosebumps with the change in Michael's appearance he got more and more distinctive as Don Corleone. When I saw the beggining of the movie again, I was so surprised! Who was he? So I'm thrilled to think each of his just action."
10,Godfather 1,I remember this one the first time I saw it. When and where .... I was glued to the tv at the time. I asked my father before is it any good cause I saw it in the tv guide and he said the famous words ....! The horse's head. So I watched it late ad night on a small tv in my bedroom when I was 13 years old and the rest is history.
10,The GodFather of Don movies,"Most of the movie addicts would have watched many Don movies, but there is nothing like ""The Godfather"". This is the benchmark movie when it comes to Don movies. Marlon Brando is not just an actor, he is a brand. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this character than Brando. The one punch line ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" will explain how beautiful this movie is. The presence of Brando in this movie is just a pleasure to watch. It's just WOW. He is amazing. Not to forget, what Al Pacino provided in this movie is nothing less than Brando. Overall, this is the best Don movie ever made."
10,Simply the Best,"This is probably the best movie ever made, well certainly the best that I have seen. One of the few movies that I find loses nothing in comparison to the book. Why can't they make more movies like this anymore? The acting is superb, the sets are great, the pace of the story is well set out, and the soundtrack is so right for the film.

Full marks to all who had anything to do with this creation."
10,Legendary,"The greatest movie of all time everything was perfect in this movie , the action, the story, the direction and the look of the movie great work done by all cast and crew"
10,Pure perfection,Everything that can go right in this movie does. This movie is a timeless classic that everyone should see.
9,A Movie you can't refuse,"Great acting, great storytelling, and compelling images all add up to make The Godfather one of the best movies of all time. From the opening frames to the final scene, one cannot help but be mesmerized with the intriguing and fascinating story of Don Vito and his family. This is a picture of epic proprtions which features outstanding performances by veteran actors Brando, Caan, Duvall and Hayden; and equally spellbinding performances by relatively newcomers Pacino, Shire, and Keaton. This is one of those rare movies where seeing it once, twice, or even three times is really not nearly enough to fully enjoy the greatness of this cinematic event. This may not be the greatest movie ever made, but if it isn't, it certainly is one of the top five. A definite must see!"
9,The cult movie,"I think nothing more to write about 'Godfather', people have already written a tons of reviews and articles on this cult movie. I think the movie like Godfather is once in a century. All characters and storyline with the best camera work are the milestone and placed in the syllabus of movie making.

The best..best and the best!"
10,Mind-blowing,Best movie ever made. I can watch this movie hundred times.
10,The Best Film of all time,Being taken on a ride with this family and how they operate in and out of the family unit is amazing. This is a masterpiece in character development and story telling leaving it wide open to further tell the story of this family and their ride to the top of the food chain.
10,most watch movie,""" The Godfather""( 1972) A Cinematic Masterpiece of Power, Family, and Redemption

In the pantheon of cinematic classics, many flicks hold a place as deified as"" The Godfather."" Directed by the fabulous Francis Ford Coppola and grounded on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, this grand crime drama isn't just a movie; it's a artistic criterion that has shaped the veritably substance of liar in film. With its indelible characters, intricate narrative, and impeccable artificer,"" The Godfather"" has stood the test of time as a cinematic masterpiece.

Set inpost-World War II New York, the film revolves around the important Italian- American Corleone crime family, led by the enigmatic primogenitor, Vito Corleone, portrayed with sublime mastery by Marlon Brando. The story opens with a grand marriage festivity, introducing us to the complex web of connections and commitment that define this world. Still, it's not long before we're drawn into a tale of power, treason, and the enduring struggle for control.

At the heart of"" The Godfather"" is the disquisition of the binary nature of the Corleone family- their felonious enterprises and their unvarying fidelity to family values. Vito Corleone is the epitome of this duality. He is a ruthless crime master who offers favors, known as"" offers you can not refuse,"" but he is also a loving father who cherishes his family above all additional. Brando's performance is nothing short of iconic, his raspy voice and miscarrying presence conveying both the imminence and humanity of his character.

Al Pacino, in his rout part as Michael Corleone, delivers a performance that's a masterclass in metamorphosis. Originally distant from the family business, Michael's trip from a war idol to the eventual heir at law to the Corleone conglomerate is a central narrative thread. Pacino's nuanced depiction captures the gradational corrosion of Michael's innocence as he becomes entangled in the world of systematized crime. His metamorphosis is both woeful and mesmerizing to substantiation.

The supporting cast is inversely exceptional. James Caan as hot- headed Sonny, Robert Duvall as the position- headed Tom Hagen, and John Cazale as the skittish Fredo, each bring depth and authenticity to their places. The ensemble's chemistry is palpable, making the Corleone family feel genuine, defective, and hugely witching .

Coppola's direction is a study in conscientiousness. He balances pressure and calm, violence and tenderheartedness with unequaled finesse. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing us to savor every moment, every line of dialogue, and every gesture. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is a visual feast, with its hand use of murk and darkness, giving the film an atmosphere of incubating intensity.

The script,co-written by Puzo and Coppola, is a triumph of liar. It weaves a shade of intricate connections, political maneuvering, and moral dilemmas. The film's iconic dialogue, including expressions like"" I will make him an offer he can not refuse,"" has come part of the wordbook of cinema. The themes of power, fidelity, and the cost of ambition reverberate profoundly, making"" The Godfather"" not just a gangbanger saga but a dateless disquisition of the mortal condition.

Nino Rota's creepy score provides the film with an emotional depth that's as integral to the liar as the performances themselves. The music serves as a poignant background to moments of triumph, tragedy, and reflection, enhancing the overall impact of the narrative.

Beyond the crime drama,"" The Godfather"" is a film about family and the choices we make. It explores the price of power and the moral negotiations individualities are willing to make for the sake of their loved bones . The immediacy of crime and family creates a moral nebulosity that leaves observers meaning the characters' conduct long after the credits roll.

"" The Godfather"" isn't just a film; it's an experience. It's a profound contemplation on power and the mortal psyche, a rich shade of liar, and a testament to the enduring power of cinema. Nearly five decades after its release, it continues to allure and impact generations of filmmakers and cult likewise.

In conclusion,"" The Godfather"" is a cinematic stint de force that transcends the crime kidney to come a work of art. Its compelling characters, intricate liar, indefectible performances, and unequaled direction make it a masterpiece of American cinema. It's a film that demands multiple viewings, each time revealing new layers andnuances. However,"" you owe it to yourself to immerse yourself in this cinematic treasure, If you have not endured the brilliance of"" The Godfather. It's a film that will ever hold its place in the annals of cinematic history, reminding us of the enduring power of liar on the tableware screen."
10,!,I read the book written by Mario Puzo 10 years ago. The book is one of my favourits. Francis Ford Coppola and his crew has succesfully imagined the story to an outstanding movie. It took me ten years to realize that i was ready to see it. I can't wait ten years too see part two...
10,The best movie IMHO,"To be honest, if this movie isn't the best ever, it's at least one of the best I've ever seen. What a masterpiece ... I've watched it twenty times since I was a teenager. A must see for all fans of gansters movies!"
10,Truly Amazing,We have reached an era where technology is at its peak .. but we go back 50 years before where cinema created works of art... one of them is the Godfather.
10,"The ""Good""Father","I've seen a lot of movies but I don't think I'm very good at reviewing movies. I love movies that are bad for the majority of people and some movie was Overrated in my opinion. But I have to say that The Godfather surpasses every movie in the history of cinema. From the actors to the story, the the action and to the drama, The Godfather is just outstanding! This movie doesn't deserve the second place on IMDb top 250. It deserves the first place. If you have not seen this movie, I don't know what you were doing all the time because you are missing the greatest movie ever. Watch it NOW! Or I will make you an offer you can't refuse!"
10,Perhaps the best film ever made is an under statement,"Perhaps the best film ever made is an under statement.....

A very powerful film that has three elements I look for the most, story, acting, and directing. One of Francis Fold Coppola's masterpieces (The God Father Part II, And Apocalypse now would be the other three)

Marlo Brando perhaps give's his most famous, and best, performance as Vito Corelone. Good acting from Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall in my second favorite performances of his.

I wold go into details of the story, but by now, most people should know what the story is therefore I won't. It is kind of surprising it only one three awards the year it came out. Granted the three were big ones (Screenplay, Best Actor, Picture).... I haven't seen Cabaret (the movie that picked up best director) So I can't judge if Fosse deserved it more than Coppola, but that's okay, Coppola got his just award the sequel (Which is an excellent flim and contender for best movie of all time as well)

One thing that really sticks with me though in the movie, is the music, I always find myself humming the themes to The Godfather more than I do anything else, and I quote the movie just as much as I do Dr. Strangelove and Monty Python (With Python being home to most of my quotes)

Rating: 10 out 10"
10,This movie reaches another level,"This movie is awesome. Don Vito Corleone character was amused. I really liked the concept very much. The movie represents the real Gang type of thing. The godfather scenario. The other parts of godfather movies are also very good.The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The Al Pacino character was also a strong character. Overall its a great movie to watch.It spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. Worth the full time of watching. Deserves a rating 10 from me. Christopher Nolan is the boss."
10,Truly a classic,"This film is truly a masterclass in every aspect of filmmaking! I truly love the cinematography, the acting and of course the scriptwriting! Every time I sit down and watch it, I learn something new about the film.

The characters seem so real that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate the actors from their character. The character's are not only believable but as the audience you feel as though you know them personally.

I believe the the production was nearly perfect. So perfect that it can compete with today's film.

I truly love this film and plan to watch and learn from it for many years to com."
10,The Best Movie of All Times and the Greatest of All,"Godfather is awesome. It is one of the movies which inspired me to give time to my family. As the Godfather has said, ""a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real men"", this movie made me think that family is so important. No matter what is your business, you must spend time with your family. And don't even ask me about the acting. Marlon Brando is really a Godfather. His acting was one of the best of all times. And this movie is the reason that I started watching Al Pacino's movies. He is the greatest actor I have ever seen. He is a legend. And the way he acted in all parts of Godfather, I don't have any words to praise him. He is the Godfather of Hollywood."
9,What makes it so good?,"What makes this movie so good? It's, most fundamentally, and perhaps most subtly, that rich, full, religious-like piety (the kind that's earnest) that it exhibits, for the family, for loyalty in general, for a kind of life of crime that inspires reverence for the criminals rather than condemnation, as if somehow these criminals are martyrs who must do all the dirty work while protecting, or at least pretending to protect, their family and others from it. The movie has a belief in honor and traditionit also has a strong belief in power, though, a commitment to it. The respect for family in these movies is inexorably connected to the inconspicuous (or perhaps conspicuous)celebration of Don Corleone and his son Michael ""doing what it takes,"" acting illicitly as a kind of sacrifice, out of manly volition; in this aspect Michael and his father are like Fortinbras as opposed to Hamlet; by acting decisively they answer Hamlet's ""to be or not to be[?]"" with a firm ""to be."" When they reflect they are more like Hamlet himself, though they do not match Hamlet's scope of thought, but the movie supplies that missing profundity with the diffusive effect which is common to all films as inspired as this one: the look is just right, the pace, the music, the blocking and the photography in general."
9,godfather,"The name is perfectly fit for this movie. This is the GODFATHER of all other movies. If you are looking for a movie that should forget you about time, this is it."
8,good,It is an amazing movie love it
9,The Godfather of movies.,"Few words required to review the first of the trilogy. Classic is predictable however the most appropriate. I personally prefer Pacino's performance in this one, many will prefer part two. Masterful performance from Brando and if Jimmy Caan was ever better I'd like to know. Great story, Great acting and Great direction I can't say anything that's not been said before. But I can confirm."
8,A movie from its time.,"Ask anyone and they'll tell you The Godfather is a great movie. It is recommended blindly by almost everyone and to a point that even if you dislike all attributes of the movie, you will still be recommended to watch it. Storyline is somewhat memorable, acting is good(not great), cast is good and setting is good. I don't recall the story too well and onky remember the memorable moments. I would watch it again but only this one, I have seen the sequals and they are all okay. There are certain movies of their time that stand outs and this is one of them. There are a few other movies from the time this was released that are also worth watching. A Friday night would be good for this. It is slow paced so don't expect blood pumping action."
10,Another one would be Great...,"If there is any classical movie out there, it would be, The Godfather. The Godfather showed how a movie should be, if it had family,business, and mobs.

Vito Corleone is the Godfather, his family quote is, ""Do you spend time with your family?...because If a man douesn't spend time with his family, then he isn't a real man."", that gave the audience, of how much the Godfather cares for his family.

In the movie Al Pacino plays as Michael, his brothers call him, Micky or Mick. He plays a important role in the movie. His dad the Godfather dies, and he takes over the family business.

There are 5 family mobs in New York, that the Corleone's are at war. Michael shoots a police officer and Sollozzo, they were in a Itailin Restuarent and Michael asked for permission to goto the restroom. In the restroom he gets what he needs to exterminate the two enemies, that were giving the Corleone Family trouble.

After that, he traveled to Sicily for a year or more. There he found a wife to marry, but it didn't take to long to find Michael. They set a bomb in their car, which killed Michael's wife.

The movie showed, great acting, and having it at the right time and mood. This movie is a masterpiece.

If your in the mood for something delightful and enjoying, then you have yourself a movie. --A.Haynes--"
10,Deserve all it's glory,"An old patriarch of a mafia family tries to submit his power to his son through violence and chaos. The Godfather is the typical mafia story, masterfully written by Mario Pulzo. Marlon Brando brilliant performance and a young Al Pacino great acting make this one of the greatest film of all times. Winner of 3 Academy Awards."
10,What else can be said?,"What else can be said about this cinematic masterpiece that has not been said a million times? What exactly is it about this movie that ranks it the #1 movie of all-time on many lists, including imdb.com's list? It isn't just the plot. While masterful, I have seen better plots before. Not many, of course, and not better by much, but there still are a couple. It's not just the acting. Again, I am hard pressed to think of better performances, but there are a few out there. I will say that Brando's acting, Pacino's, Caan's, Duvall's, Keaton's, and so many others all mixed together were awesome. But it's not only the way each one acts, but also the way each one acts off the others. But still, the acting alone could not make this movie #1. The cinematography, the lighting, the sound, the musical score, all these were terrific, but none of them made this movie. So then, what DOES make this movie what it is? I would say that it is taking all of these elements together and breathing life into them. Rather than simply being a voyeur, watching all the action from the outside, the viewer is thrust into the middle of it. He becomes surrounded by the action and to a certain extent becomes part of the Corleone family. And as the movie races towards its climax, the viewer is pulled emotionally at every turn, forcing hatred towards good people, love towards evil people, respect for those who do not deserve it, and ultimately a great deal of sympathy for a man who rules with an iron fist and seems to be too concerned with his own well-being to care about the feelings of anyone else. And yet, at the same time, we see that he does care, and he does feel, and he does love. There is a tremendous feeling of family in this movie, a great sense of belonging. And I believe that is the secret to this movie. The viewer is not left on the outside, but brought inside warmly to share the innermost thoughts and feelings of men he might normally avoid and fear. And the viewer learns a profound secret by watching this movie: There is no greater desire than the desire to belong, to be a part of something, no matter what that something may be; and this desire will be ultimately fulfilled no matter how much it is ignored or resisted. Underneath it all, we are all the same."
10,Just 2 words!!!,"Piece of Art!!! Simply amazing movie , every person needs to see this, it teaches you many things in life, gives you inteligence and experience the movie like you've been there and came across all of those !! simply breath taking!"
9,VERY GOOD,"Very good movie, one of the best movies. I see last one, I want To give you so many movies made so good"
10,Simply a masterful piece of film-making,"Simply a masterful piece of film-making.

The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.

Godfather is one of the cinematic classics and it's really difficult to pinpoint one thing which would make it a big success that it is. Family life, family struggle, every day problems all shown in the movie. This movie deserves a huge shoutout. Glad to see that this movie being so old is still fresh and releavnt to the todays audience. Evergreen film."
10,The Best of All Time,"It's remarkable how a film 30 years old can still amaze even teens (I'm 17, you know). It has an incredible script and its filming is just perfect. It doesn't have any flaw, and probably the best highlight is its cast with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. etc. etc., all of them shine thru the movie and make this (too) long film most enjoyable despite the extreme length. With two worth viewing sequels (specially Godfather II with the majestic Robert De Niro), The Godfather is best saga in history of movies, much, but much more than Star Wars. The one and only classic in movie history, the best of all times that can never be beaten."
10,masterpiece,"like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............like I said , masterpiece, my review is for the IMDb task............"
10,Amazing Story,I think is an amazing movie with great characters and a unique music.
10,Great movie I have ever seen.,"I love this movie.

Because this movie changed my life.

I decide to be a writer and movie director for the 'Godfather'

I always wanted to be a part of beautiful story, powerful performance of directing and co-work with great actors."
10,World best movie still now in 2021,World best movie..nothing to say specchless story ....just say its the best and no movie beat that movie still now in 2021.
9,I mean...,"What can you say? Its a flawless film. This here is a pinnacle of crime films the cinematic lighting. The acting which is top notch, and that ending. I mean it has so much impact that it's impact is still in effect when I see it being parodied in other media."
10,The best film of all times,"This is definetely the best film af all times and Marlon Brondo's appearance is the acting of the century! Al Pacino is also great. The supporting roles (R. Duvall, J.Kaan, T. Shire) give also great performances. 10 out of 10"
9,"A Tale of Family, Loyalty, and the Cost of Power","The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone crime family, the film is a sweeping epic that tells the story of the rise and fall of a powerful Mafia clan.

Brando's performance as the aging and complex Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary. He brings a depth and complexity to the character that is rarely seen in film, and it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. The rest of the cast is equally strong, with standout performances from Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton.

The Godfather is a film that is rich in detail and character development. The cinematography is beautiful, and the score by Nino Rota is iconic. The film's themes of family, loyalty, and power are timeless and still resonant today. On the other hand, it is a pretty lengthy movie, that, from time to time, becomes a bit boring.

Overall, The Godfather is a must-see for any fan of classic cinema."
9,Cool !,The Best Movie I Ever Seen In my entire Life I don't Know its Just Awesome !!
10,The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"Best gangster movie!!!This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing."
10,On of the best movies ever made.,This movie is one of the best ever made. Marlon Brando as its best beside -on the waterfront-. I've never seen a man playing a role like this. so realistic and authentic. He is for me the greatest actor of all time. a young Pacino or a Robert Duvall are terrific too. Family and Italian traditions are the main themes in this movie. even lessons about life you will in this movie. it shows the strength of a family.The American way of life.A dark history in the states are shown. The influence of criminal organizations to politics and the system are clear to see. you can put the whole movie plot to this time and it will still be effective . thats why the movie is so genius. A non true story film with true messages! strictly Art.
10,An American Classic,"The Godfather is a definitive example of cinematic perfection. There is nothing lacking from the film; acting, direction, cinematography; all perfect. And, like any good American classic, it becomes better with every viewing. Marlon Brando seems to get all the credit, but I believe Al Pacino delivered the film's greatest performance, as well as one of cinema's greatest. The Godfather is timeless, and will be treasured for decades to come.

Rating: 10"
10,The Quintessential Mafia Movie,"I don't have too much to say about it, but GOD DAMN THAT MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! Going into it, my expectations were cautious because of how hyped it is. I know it is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and with how long it is I expected at least a little bit of dragged out plot or slowness, but every single moment was riveting. This movie is absolutely the best I've ever seen in regards to knowing when and how to present the story. It reserves itself and only gets brutal/intense when necessary, and even the most simple and quiet of scenes have an immense sense of meaning to them. My heart pounded harder than it EVER has in a movie during the entire restaurant scene, the tension was unbelievable. The acting was phenomenal, the rapport between characters was so visceral and real and despite being the furthest thing from a mobster, I cared so deeply for these characters and their family.

I will say, I have actually never watched a mob/gangster movie, I think maybe that might have elevated my experience. I've seen a lot of people complain about how this movie isn't that special considering the ones that came after it, but is someone who has never watched a mobster movie before, this was absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen if not the best.

That was, until Part II."
9,Movie of knowledg!,"I saw it first when i was a kid and understood nothin!... Watching after im 20,.. I found it as a masterpiece !!"
10,"The Godfather"" Review: A Timeless Masterpiece Worth Every Accolade","Sometimes, there's no avoiding the obvious: ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre and deserves its place among the greatest films ever made. Despite its gangster narrative, it captivates even those who might shy away from violent or crime-centered stories. The film's strength lies in its brilliant writing, flawless direction, and performances that resonate deeply with viewers. It is a complete package of art, emotion, and storytelling.

If you're venturing into this classic for the first time, my suggestion would be to explore ""The Godfather Saga"", a television version that combines Part I and Part II with additional scenes. This expanded version offers a deeper, richer experience that enhances the already impeccable narrative. Whatever version you choose, watching ""The Godfather"" is an essential experience for any film lover. Don't miss it."
10,The greatest movie of all time...,"So i first saw The Godfather when i must have been no older than 12 and to be honest nothing memorable stuck with me...the only thing i'd remembered from it was that it had a lot of dialogue and was very slow, however at the age of 34 when i decided to watch it again i realized that at 12 years old i was naive and nowhere near mature enough to understand it and the meaning, watching it as an adult & fully engaged it was a completely different movie to what my young mind recalled. The acting, the dialogue, the atmosphere, story, EVERYTHING about this film down to the little details is perfect and to top it off it's without a doubt one of the only movies to have a sequel that is just as good as it's predeccesor, The Godfather Part 1 & 2 are the absolute pinnacle of Cinema and there genuinely hasn't been any movie or TV show that comes close to either of them as far as crime dramas go!"
10,Take the picture Leave the Cannolis,"Great picture, great cast. Now see the Offer to tell you how they did it! On Paramount +. Good cast and you won't regret paying for a subscription. Godfather set the pace and rules for every other gangster movie since!"
10,Nice,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

10,kutuktde,"undoubtebly the best movie ever and godfather part 2 is easily the second best and im sick of people saying part 3 is s*** its not that bad it easily should be in the top 50 movies ever . marlon brando by the way is easily the best actor ever without question his acting in on the waterfront ' the godfather, and apocalypse now was second to none. al pacino and robert deniro are the next best without question you only have to watch movies like dog day afternoon , scarface,taxi driver, raging bull,scent of a women ,heat, the deer hunter, not to mention their roles in the godfather"
9,awsome,"The Godfather movie was a beautiful Yasar movie. Although this movie is an old movie, it has a very interesting scenario. Every part of this movie is better than the previous part.

I hope this movie continues. I don't want to spoil this movie for other people, but I recommend that they definitely see this movie.

This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film."
10,Verry Good,"I liked the movie very much because it talks about an important issue and the direction was a masterpiece literally, and I loved the actors and the writer excelled in his wonderful artistic writing like all his previous films."
10,The best movie of all-time,Really classic. Magnificent portrait of organized crime. A must-see gangster movie.
10,Amazing piece of art,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox."
9,All Time Best Gangster Movie,"The Godfather is the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema. Its an absolute masterpiece.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
10,Best to date...,"Best mafia movie to date. Everything from the performance of the stellar cast, to the direction, the writing, the producing, and even location... a timeless classic! Much respect to the filmmakers, cast, and crew involved in creating this cinema great! I wonder at times if there will ever another great mafia/mob film like this and if so in what era and which filmmaker will achieve in creating that world. Only time will tell."
10,The ultimate no. 1 movie for me!,"Great gangster movie, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. And its deaths"
10,Not #1,"When I saw that The Godfather ranked number 1 on the IMDb top 250, ahead of The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List, among others, I knew I had to see it. I rented it and watched it through a couple times. I'm having trouble figuring out why this is everyone's favorite.

It's a well made film, probably top 50 material, but it really wasn't a intoxicating, compelling, or moving experience for me. It isn't just a difference in taste, because I also saw The Godfather Part II, and that is one of the greatest films I've ever seen; top five material. I just never got into The Godfather's storyline. It's well made and all, just not the best, in my opinion."
10,the perfect movie,The film the godfather is the film that rocked my childhood. I grew up with the replicas of marlon brando. My children are also addicted to the godfather trilogy.
10,"Well done Coppola, you are a classy Italian","Bravo roles are passed and there are no stupid and unpassable roles. The film is naturally very good and for its time it was a bomb. Marlon Brando's strength is in acting well. Al Pacino is great as a young man and even better as an old man. ""The Godfather"" received three Oscars - for best picture, for best actor (Marlon Brando) and for best adapted screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola). It was also nominated in seven other categories, including Best Supporting Actor (Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall) and Best Director (Francis Ford Coppola). Well, not as crushed as Shawshank."
10,It only gets lower from here!,"The Best movie of all time, Shawshank should be second"
10,This Movie Is,"One of the best crafted gangster film ever. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. 10 stars out of 10."
10,lucky movie,"This is movie fantastic, because many fight and strong man. So you must wacht it!!"
10,Excellent!,"This movie is really amazing, it is quite long but it is well worked the whole way through. The story is continuously a work of art that never stops. I really love the performance of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, they are truly both well suited for this types of movies. No wonder that Al Pacino is doing the characters he does.

I would recommend this movie to all ages. Even though the movie is about mafia and murderers, I would say it still okay to watch for a younger audience since the material is not that bloody. The best part is that there are two more movies to see after you have finished this one. I love these movies, the surroundings, clothing and atmosphere is just amazing."
10,best mafia movie,Overall the acting for everyone in this movie were really good tbh. would recomend this movie if yall havent watched it
10,Nice movie,"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.

Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever."
10,An incredible experience.,"(Short overall review) I watched ""The Godfather"" in 2013. It was broadcast Sunday evening at 20:00 and the sequel and prequel followed after one week each. At the time, my most favorite movie was only one. Even though I had watched numerous classics and modern films (Lord of the rings, Starwars, etc) I could only say ""This is my favorite movie"" to one production. But after I watched ""The Godfather"" the number increased. To say anything bad for this film will be an abomination. I have given several 10s in IMDb, to films I like, but I have always realized that if this was an official review I couldn't give 10 to any of them. That is not true for this one. This film truly deserves a 10 and will remain on the top of my list of the greatest movies of all time."
